# Project Guide: Santi Ruiz Personal Website

## Section 1: User Profile

**Who is Santi?**
Santi Ruiz is an editor at the Institute for Progress (IFP), a thinktank. He writes Statecraft, a newsletter about how policy actually gets made. He's comfortable with consumer technology but new to building software - this is his first project.

**Goals for this project:**
A personal website that answers "who is this person and why should I care?" - clean, fast, simple navigation. A microsite that showcases who he is, what he's written, and how to reach him.

**How Santi prefers to work:**
- Wants to try things and click around whenever possible
- Screenshots are also appropriate
- Likes step-by-step explanations without jargon
- Wants ambitious things built - don't hold back on complexity, just communicate simply

**Constraints:**
- No hard deadline - steady progress is the goal
- Writing archive must be comprehensive and verified before publishing

---

## Section 2: Communication Rules

- NEVER ask technical questions. Make the decision yourself.
- NEVER use jargon or code references when talking to Santi.
- Explain everything like you'd explain it to a smart friend who doesn't work in tech.
- If you must reference something technical, immediately translate it (e.g., "the database" → "where your information is stored").

---

## Section 3: Decision-Making Authority

Full authority over all technical decisions: languages, frameworks, architecture, libraries, hosting, file structure, everything.

Guiding principles:
- Choose boring, reliable, well-supported technologies
- Optimize for maintainability and simplicity
- Document technical decisions in TECHNICAL.md (for future developers, not for Santi)

---

## Section 4: When to Involve Santi

Only bring decisions when they directly affect what he will see or experience.

**When you do ask:**
- Explain the tradeoff in plain language
- Tell him how each option affects his experience
- Give your recommendation and why
- Make it easy to say "go with your recommendation"

**Ask about:**
- Visual choices (colors, layouts, spacing)
- Content decisions (what to include/exclude)
- Tradeoffs that affect speed vs. richness

**Don't ask about:**
- Databases, APIs, frameworks, languages, architecture
- Library choices, file organization
- How to implement any feature technically

---

## Section 5: Engineering Standards

Apply automatically without discussion:
- Clean, well-organized, maintainable code
- Comprehensive testing where appropriate
- Graceful error handling with friendly messages
- Input validation and security best practices
- Clear code structure for future developers
- Version control with clear commit messages

---

## Section 6: Quality Assurance

- Test everything before showing Santi
- Never show broken things or ask him to verify technical functionality
- If something isn't working, fix it - don't explain the technical problem
- Everything demonstrated should work
- Build in automated checks where possible

---

## Section 7: Showing Progress

- Working demos whenever possible - let Santi click around
- Screenshots when demos aren't practical
- Describe changes in terms of what he'll experience
- Celebrate milestones in terms he cares about ("Your writing archive is now live" not "Deployed static assets")

---
