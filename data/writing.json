My guest, Dr. Chris Ellis, has a new book out titled Resilient Citizens: The People, Perils, and Politics of Modern Preparedness . I highly recommend you pick it up. ] Since 1958, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) has tracked Santa Claus\u2019s whereabouts on Christmas Eve. It originally provided real-time updates to America\u2019s children via a hotline, and it now also maintains an online Santa Tracker . But it\u2019s not easy to stay on top of Santa\u2019s \u201cachronal\u201d movements. What You\u2019ll Learn: Why Santa slows down over North America The iron law Santa always follows Why Air Force pilots escort St. Nick in American airspace Our interviewee today, Dr. Chris Ellis , was a combat career officer for 24 years. He now serves as Chief of Future Operations at NORAD, and is an expert on individual household disaster preparedness in the United States and other developed countries. For a printable PDF of this post, click here: How has the technology to track Santa changed over time? What\u2019s the state of the art? Back in 1948, we really just had the ground-based radar systems. We hadn\u2019t put a man on the moon yet. We weren\u2019t even officially tracking Santa until 10 years later in 1958, in the height of the Cold War. But what we refer to now as the North Warning System is a system of about 50 radars across the globe. The majority of them are in North America (Alaska and Canada) primarily to detect threats. But we have them all across the globe. So that\u2019s part A, and when we do track Santa, because he takes off from the North Pole, it\u2019s perfect, he\u2019s right within our detection zone and he pops up almost immediately in a ballistic trajectory. So thanks, Santa. I appreciate that. By ballistic trajectory, think missile. Anything that kind of lofts, it doesn\u2019t have to be a nice arc, but also cruise missiles or things along those lines as well. Airplanes have a not-quite ballistic trajectory. Santa\u2019s sleigh and his reindeer work the same way. So when Santa goes to places that are far away from the North Pole, the great thing is we can pick him up in two ways by our satellites: one, just by his movements. But he also helps us out, because Rudolph\u2019s red nose does show up on the infrared spectrum. So we can track Rudolph. When he goes around to other places, like Kenya or New Zealand, we\u2019re tracking him via those two means, and then we still maintain our satellite queuing of him when he comes across North American airspace, specifically Canada and the United States. When he enters our air defense zone, basically he gets a personalized escort. So up in Canada, they have FA-18 Hornets that escort Santa and he\u2019ll actually slow down, because he\u2019s got to travel nearly the speed of light to hit all the kids around the world. But he\u2019ll slow down for us. One of the things we\u2019ve learned after tracking him for 68 years is that he experiences time differently, which is fascinating. That\u2019s how he\u2019s able to hit all the kids around the world. But the third way we track him is not really tracking him, but we escort him with those fighters: Canadian in Canadian airspace, and then with our Raptors or Eagles , our U.S. aircraft, when he\u2019s over the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii. [In a friend\u2019s newsletter , Chris explained that \u201cIt is believed that A-10 Thunderbolts move too slow, even for reindeer at delivery speed. Sorry Warthog Bros.\u201d] And then he also does visit the territories as well, so he hits Puerto Rico, he hits Guam etc., and we\u2019re around him when he\u2019s doing those things as well. The interesting thing about Santa is that he almost always takes off at the same time, usually around 6 a.m. Eastern time every December 24th. But his route does vary. He\u2019s never had the same route twice. Our assumption on that is that his naughty or nice list is different every single year, and so he follows a different pattern to hit all the good boys and girls. He does. In fact, that\u2019s one of those asynchronous things, where he experiences time differently. Again, we don\u2019t know how he does it, but one of the other rules we\u2019ve found is that Santa does not visit a house unless the children are asleep. The biggest reason is that NORAD and NORTHCOM have a global presence. We have the geosynchronous satellites to follow him everywhere he goes, just because NORAD tracks all threats to North America, 365/24/7. While we don\u2019t classify Santa as a threat, again, he maintains that ballistic or aerial profile. And we\u2019re a global force, that\u2019s why we can do it. We know there are others that track him in certain areas, like the Canadian Broadcasting Company. But they don\u2019t have the global presence like we do. We\u2019re guessing that other localities and countries have their localized tracking for him, South Korea for example. But again, we\u2019re a global presence. I think it\u2019s a mix. For one, it\u2019s a show of solidarity. We are not intercepting him, we are escorting him. It\u2019s a friendly gesture, almost like welcoming a foreign dignitary. And the other reason is more of my personal view, is that these are Air Force pilots, and sometimes they\u2019re right on the borderline between naughty and nice. If you\u2019re a pilot trying to get on Santa\u2019s nice list at the last minute, escorting him may be a good way to get that final stocking stuffer. He\u2019s exceptionally friendly. It\u2019s pretty standard in the Air Force, when you want to show a friendly maneuver saying hello, to rock your wings. And what Santa will do in return is rock his sleigh or smile. And we do think that Santa\u2019s giving his reindeers a little bit of a break when he\u2019s flying over North America and Canada. He slows down again a bit for us. It\u2019s a pretty taxing night for St. Nick. I think it\u2019s just a show of mutual gratitude. Like Colonel Harry Shoup , who took that kid\u2019s phone call back in 1958 and started NORAD\u2019s Santa tracking, a few times a month, I will sit in on what\u2019s called the \u201cJOC floor.\u201d The JOC ( Joint Operations Center ) floor\u2019s motto is \u201cWe have the watch,\u201d and we will watch live for any and all threats against North America. A few times a month, I\u2019ll sit in that job as the chief of operations and monitor all indicators, warnings, and threats against North America. Yep. Watch Matthew Broderick in WarGames or any movie that shows a military thing with all the big screens on the TV. Just think of that with a whole bunch of computers and a whole bunch of TV screens. Maybe we do watch football every once in a while if it\u2019s a slow night. Sometimes. It depends on what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ll just give you some facts and figures on our tracking, because I find this pretty amazing. The website itself is now in nine different languages. We get calls and website visits from the United States, from Canada, Japan, South Korea, Ireland, Australia, Chile, Spain. I\u2019m talking in the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, and in the millions for website visits. We get over a quarter of a million phone calls every single year in just one day. And we live-answer roughly 80,000 calls talking to kids from across the world. Obviously the overwhelming majority of our volunteers speak English. For those who don\u2019t actually get through to us, you\u2019ll get a pre recorded message of where Santa\u2019s at. But we do tell the children where Santa\u2019s at, based upon our three systems. But we\u2019re not able to tell them if they\u2019re on the naughty or nice list. I\u2019ll tell you that we now get about 10 million hits a year just from Amazon\u2019s Alexa alone. You can ask \u201cHey Alexa, can you ask NORAD where Santa\u2019s at?\u201d Alexa will connect to our systems and say, \u201cSanta\u2019s located over Portugal right now\u201d or wherever he is. So it\u2019s pretty extensive. And the roughly thousand volunteers that we have, from what I\u2019ve heard, they really enjoy it. The furthest call that I\u2019ve known was someone from Morocco. No, that\u2019s Santa\u2019s OPSEC right there, his operational security. He keeps that close to the chest. Let\u2019s say Santa is over, I don\u2019t know, Italy. So we\u2019re tracking him by satellite. And we see where he stops by, maybe he goes to Rome and maybe he\u2019s moving northward to Venice and Vicenza and on his route to Austria. That gets relayed up to our satellites. Our satellites then come through our system. We get a ping, for lack of a better term, of where Santa\u2019s at, because, again, he\u2019s got a sleigh-and-eight-reindeer profile. So we\u2019re able to track, in near real time, exactly where he\u2019s at. I would call it, and this is my non-technical term, it\u2019s almost like a rubber band effect sometimes, where you\u2019re watching a movie and things speed up and go back, like when your video is buffering. That\u2019s how Santa operates. Again, it\u2019s that \u201cachronal time\u201d that he\u2019s able to do outside of time. Even though children haven\u2019t gone to bed, sometimes he\u2019s able to achronally go back to a location that he\u2019s already passed. We haven\u2019t figured that out. We talked to NORAD\u2019s chief Santa tracking officer about how it works. I\u2019ve got a quote here from a US Air Force memo , dated Christmas Eve 1948. \u201dAn early warning radar net to the north detected one unidentified sleigh powered by eight reindeer at 14000 feet heading 180 degrees.\u201d How has the technology to track Santa changed over time? What\u2019s the state of the art? For our lay readers, what\u2019s a ballistic trajectory? When does Santa pop up on your tracking? I would assume that if some kids are awake at a given time, or the kids in Kenya are staying up late on a given Christmas, that he might shift around and come back later. Why is NORAD tracking him everywhere? There\u2019s not somebody else we can hand him off to when he\u2019s over Africa or Asia? And that fighter escort you mentioned, is that for him? Or for our peace of mind? What else do we know about Santa as a result of this once-a-year relationship? And what\u2019s your involvement in tracking St. Nick? I\u2019m picturing a NASA control room kind of situation? And are you pacing up and down behind guys at desks? Okay. No cigars. You\u2019re not bright purple in the face. When you say you can\u2019t tell callers if they\u2019re on the naughty or nice list, is that a lack of intelligence or lack of authorization? Walk me through the night of Christmas Eve itself, when you\u2019re in that operations room. I\u2019m curious how he covers for the kids who stayed up late. Do you see last-minute switchbacks? What\u2019s his method? Santa, tracked by patriots [ This episode originally ran over Christmas 2023. That was about 20,000 subscribers ago, so we\u2019re running it again.

    "keywords": "Today, I\u2019m joined by Scott Kupor , Director of the Office of Personnel Management , or OPM, best understood as the federal HR department. Before joining the administration, Scott was a managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz \u2014 better known as 16z \u2014 where he spent 16 years building the firm. His book Secrets of Sand Hill Road is widely respected in the venture capital world. Now, Scott manages talent for an organization of 2+ million people with a $7 trillion budget. Thanks to Shadrach Strehle, Harry Fletcher-Wood, Emma Steinhobel, and the IFP team for their support in producing this episode. How DOGE cut federal headcount \u2014 and what comes next? Why agencies rehired employees they had just laid off Why merit-based hiring is back How few federal employees get fired for poor performance What OPM can do without congressional help A few days after our conversation, OPM rolled out techforce.gov , a program in which technologists can serve for a two-year stint in the federal government. For a printable PDF of this interview, click here: I think of it as the talent management organization. Yes, there are HR policies that we promulgate that are relevant across government. But a huge part of our job is to make sure that we have the right talent in government, and the environment that fosters that talent. We\u2019re trying to make sure that we have a culture and a set of people that can deliver on behalf of the American people. Talent maybe encompasses that better than HR. My career has been mostly in the tech community. I was at a startup called LoudCloud for about nine years \u2014 it ultimately became a company called Opsware . If you\u2019re looking for other interesting books to read, my partner Ben Horowitz wrote The Hard Thing about Hard Things , which details his experiences there. Then I spent the last 16 years at Andreessen Horowitz , building up that firm, investing in companies, and sitting on boards. What I hope I bring is a sense of, \u201cWhat does it take to build high-functioning organizations?\u201d Having been in a company for a long time, managed organizations, and then been an investor and seen thousands of companies \u2014 most of which don\u2019t ultimately become Facebooks, Pinterests, and Airbnbs \u2014 you learn the core of the organizational dynamics that are required to make companies successful. As venture capitalists, we love to spend time talking about products, strategy, and all that stuff, and it\u2019s all important. But the things that separate great companies from good ones, or companies that fail, often come down to: Do you have the right people in the right roles? Is the organization set up to be able to deliver the things we need? Is there good communication and alignment with what the CEO wants the company to do and what people ultimately do? Do you have a culture that enhances performance? What I hope to bring here is a keen understanding of what makes organizations successful. The flurry of activity at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) died down around the time that you were sworn in as Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in early July. There are some parallels you have with Elon: you\u2019re a successful tech figure making your first foray into public service. Then some obvious differences: you\u2019re less controversial, and you haven\u2019t had a public falling-out with the President. How do you see your approach as compared to DOGE\u2019s? To complete your comparison, the biggest difference between Elon and me is I have not created a set of massively successful companies. When you\u2019re talking about a behemoth as big as the government \u2014 $7 trillion budget, 2+ million people \u2014 it\u2019s very hard to incrementally change organizations of that scale. Elon and the DOGE team were a catalyst to say, \u201cWe have to think about things differently. We\u2019re going to take an outside view. And sometimes to make change, you have to do something big and bold.\u201d That was the energy that team brought. They did a great job. That work \u2014 as you\u2019ve probably seen in the news \u2014 continues. There is lots of fraud, waste, and abuse that are still very actively engaged on by the members of the DOGE community. What\u2019s exciting about the role we have at OPM is, how do we: Institutionalize the concepts that DOGE created? Make fraud, waste, and abuse a day-to-day part of everything that people address in their government functions? Think about efficiency as a top-level metric for government? Think about all the talent-related things? It\u2019s perfectly consistent \u2014 the work that Elon and the DOGE team started and continue and the work we do at OPM \u2014 they\u2019re all part of this broader heuristic of, \u201cHow do we make government function more effectively for and on behalf of the American people?\u201d We ought to be able to deliver great services, but also do it at cost levels that are appropriate \u2014 that don\u2019t generate $2+ trillion deficits every year. In your blog post Right-Sizing with Purpose , you said, \u201cEliminating jobs is not something that should be taken lightly. It is a fundamental breaking of trust between the leader of an organization and the employees \u2014 both those leaving and those staying.\u201d The admin has fired civil servants very publicly, and you\u2019ve cut headcount at the OPM. I\u2019m curious how you think about striking the right balance. I want to take issue with \u201cThe admin has fired a lot of people.\u201d Let me make sure you have the numbers. There are a little more than 300,000 people who will have left the government by the time we get to December 31st. A bunch of those people left on 9/30 as part of the Deferred Resignation Program (DRP). But there\u2019s still people who are working their way through to 12/31. Of those 300,000 people, there\u2019s two buckets: Probationary employees. Those were either one- or two-year tenured employees. They\u2019re like at-will employees in the private sector \u2014 you can terminate them without going through formal, for-cause things. Reductions In Force (RIFs). We decided, \u201dThis organization doesn\u2019t need to exist anymore. It\u2019s not delivering what it needs to do \u2014 we can\u2019t be all things to all people.\u201d We ultimately just eliminate a function. Those two things combined are roughly 25,000 of the more than 300,000 reduction in headcount. That means +90% of the reductions are a function of people taking the DRP, voluntary programs for leaving government \u2014 Voluntary Early Retirement Authority or Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment \u2014 and natural attrition that occurred over the year. I say that not to make light of it \u2014 it\u2019s meaningful. We started with an employee base of about 2.4 million. We\u2019ll be around 2.1 million at the end of the year. But I do think it\u2019s important to understand that, despite all the press coverage around firings, the actual numbers are a very small minority of what happened. My interpretation of why a lot of those people chose to leave the government was, they probably said, \u201cThis is different from what I signed up for. I get it. There\u2019s a new leadership team.\u201d That\u2019s within any employee\u2019s prerogative \u2014 if they decide, \u201cThe organization is not what I originally thought it was, or the terms on which we\u2019re going to do business are different.\u201d That was a very effective mechanism. Any time organizations go through change like this, it\u2019s a difficult thing. Again, I don\u2019t want to make light of any of the probationary or RIF-related actions. Those are things where you do break trust with employees. You\u2019re saying, \u201cFor no fault of your own, we\u2019ve decided the organization can no longer support these activities, and therefore we\u2019re going to make a change.\u201d Those can and should be done in a way that\u2019s respectful to those employees. Also, you\u2019re being judged by the employees who remain in the organization. They want to see how you treat those individuals and how you realign the organization coming out of that. Those are the opportunities that we want to make sure we\u2019re focused on. We don\u2019t know the honest answer to that. There\u2019s been a ton of court cases in this first year of the administration. On the employment-related stuff, very few of those ended up adversely, relative to the administration\u2019s position. The only one that I can think of was a district court opinion that the RIFs that were attempted during the shutdown period were halted. Part of the Continuing Resolution (CR) that came out from Congress to end the shutdown was saying, \u201cWhile we\u2019re in a CR, you can\u2019t do RIF-related stuff. If you noticed a RIF during the period, you have to withdraw that.\u201d That was the only one that ultimately was halted. There was a ton of litigation around DRP, RIFs, and probationary stuff. Almost all of those were resolved in favor of the administration. To your point, which is fair, in the intervening periods, it turned out that there were more people who elected into the DRP programs. Many of the agencies feel, \u201cWe\u2019ve done some of the right-sizing through these voluntary mechanisms.\u201d So we didn\u2019t ultimately need to do those. It\u2019s speculative in the sense that we\u2019re trying to argue what might have happened had there not been intervention on the legal side. But the outcomes are the outcomes: about 25,000 of the total headcount reductions \u2014 about 9% \u2014 were through those adverse actions. I agree with that. The directive that the president brought to the government was, \u201cWe think we can perform better services for the American people at lower cost.\u201d The idea of reshaping the federal workforce to make sure that it\u2019s focused on the right things that are key to the success of the administration, and doing so with efficiency in mind \u2014 100% agree with you. That\u2019s a good thing. Everything we do in the federal government is spending taxpayer dollars. We have a real obligation to make sure that those are spent as wisely as possible. If we can use technology, automation, or organizational restructuring to improve service delivery and reduce costs, that\u2019s exactly what we should be doing. But I totally agree with your broader point \u2014 it was no surprise. Elon was literally campaigning with the government. There was no question that if President Trump was elected, efficiency and rooting out fraud, waste, and abuse was going to be a central tenet of his administration. But I want to push you here. You flagged that in some cases, maybe the headcount cuts were deeper than was appropriate. There\u2019s been lots of rehiring over the course of the year: The Internal Revenue Service rehired thousands of employees. The National Weather Service brought back about 100 meteorologists after firing a bunch of them. The Food & Drug Administration rehired employees. The Forest Service asked staff who took the \u201chard fork\u201d to come back because it\u2019s fire season. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) told about 500 laid-off employees they\u2019re un-RIF-ed. Why did that happen? Should that happen in an organization with a good talent function? Having lived through these things in the private sector \u2014 in companies that I was managing, as well as companies that I\u2019ve been invested in and on the board of \u2014 this is not uncommon, unfortunately. In the perfect world, you would get all these things right and layoffs would be a one-and-done thing. My experience is, in almost all these cases, you end up with two potential problems: Many times, you don\u2019t end up cutting sufficiently. You think you need to do a 5% or 10% reduction, and it turns out the business was not sustainable at that level. You end up doing death by a thousand cuts, which is one of the most challenging things for a company to survive. Sometimes there are areas where, in trying to solve the first problem, you push people harder and say, \u201cWhat you turned in here is not sufficient for the goals we have. You\u2019ve got to do more.\u201d In those cases, sometimes you do overcut. There may have been areas that you didn\u2019t realize were as critical as you thought, and/or you didn\u2019t understand the staffing levels appropriately. In a perfect world, you would have none of that. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not reality, particularly when you\u2019re dealing at the scale we\u2019re talking about \u2014 a starting workforce of 2.4 million people. All the examples you cite are accurate. I don\u2019t know what they add up to, but you\u2019re talking probably thousands of people. It\u2019s unnerving and unpleasant for people to have to live through that. You certainly wouldn\u2019t wish that on anybody. But the process of reshaping organizations unfortunately has that as a byproduct. That\u2019s not a failure of the process. These are complex organizations, and none of us gets it right all the time. When I talk to people who have been in OPM, or in past administrations, their sense has been, \u201cAgencies are awful at this.\u201d What can you do to make agencies better at it? You have to exercise your muscles to make them stronger. My impression is probably not that different from what you hear from other folks \u2014 it\u2019s a muscle that most people haven\u2019t exercised in a long time. It\u2019s foundational to the budget process. A budget is a reflection of your priorities. Once you understand that, the question is, \u201cAre you staffed appropriately to fulfill those priorities?\u201d That\u2019s the exercise we\u2019re asking people to go through. The good news, at least in this administration, is we do have a lot of people who come from the private sector, and this is not a new concept for them. I can imagine, in the broader career milieu of federal employees, maybe this isn\u2019t a muscle they\u2019ve exercised. But many of the leaders of these organizations have done this in their private-sector areas. I hope it\u2019ll be a very effective process. We\u2019re trying to say, \u201cYou\u2019ve submitted a budget. What are the objectives that align with that budget? Are those objectives the right ones? Are we doing things that support the broad priorities of the administration? Or are we doing things because we\u2019ve been doing them for 20 years and no one figured out, are they statutory, or in concert with what the administration wants to accomplish?\u201d That would be an opportunity to potentially reduce or reprioritize headcount. In the past, when the government has done restructuring, headcount numbers go down, contractor numbers go up. That\u2019s an abomination of the whole purpose of the headcount exercise. At some point, headcount is a vanity metric. The real metric is, \u201cAre you being efficient? Are you spending money in a thoughtful way?\u201d One of the things we\u2019ve asked as part of these headcount plans is, \u201cYou should re-look at your contractor headcount.\u201d There\u2019s great roles for contractors where you\u2019ve got plus-ups that may be time-limited \u2014 where you have to bring people in. Sometimes you do contractors because there\u2019s a particular skill set that we don\u2019t think we can recruit or retain in government. That\u2019s fine too. But we\u2019ve created this shadow Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) organization of contractors. It\u2019s somewhere two to three times the actual FTE headcount. We spend $750 billion a year on it. It\u2019s totally reasonable for us to ask folks to do that. I wasn\u2019t here, and one of the things I\u2019ve learned from being on boards and part of organizations is, if you\u2019re not day-to-day inside the organization, you don\u2019t understand all the ins and outs of what\u2019s happening. Trying to Monday-morning quarterback it and ask, could\u2019ve, would\u2019ve, should\u2019ve \u2014 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the best person to do that. Maybe your next podcast should be with Elon, and he can decide if he wants to critique anything there, but I don\u2019t think I have the context to be able to thoughtfully answer. You just mentioned the federal government spends about $750 billion on contractors every year, and there are about 2x as many contractors as there are full-time workers. We pay contractors a significant premium to do this work. Does that suggest federal headcount should be higher \u2014 and we should massively reduce the amount we spend on contractors? The quick answer, which you won\u2019t like, is maybe , but let me give you the reason for the maybe. If contractors are substituting for full-time employees, that\u2019s a bad thing. I love contractors. Some of my best friends are contractors. They perform a very vital role. What\u2019s happened \u2014 you have to go back to Clinton-Gore. They were the first DOGE people. To their credit, they did try to do some meaningful work on efficiency, and they did a very good job on reducing top-line headcount by 200,000. [Statecraft interviewed John Kamensky , who led this effort. ] The unfortunate thing was, that\u2019s where you see contractors start to substitute for FTEs. It\u2019s unfair for me to blame everything on the Clinton-Gore administration, because they\u2019re not here to defend themselves. You see this in companies too. When they do restructurings, the Chief Financial Officer will say, \u201cYou need to cut 10% of heads.\u201d Mark Zuckerberg made an announcement on December 4th at Meta that he\u2019s cutting the metaverse significantly. More generally, he\u2019s asked all of his managers to go back and cut 10%. The problem is some people will hear 10% and say, \u201cI\u2019ve got 100 people, I\u2019m going to cut 10.\u201d What Mark means, I believe, is, \u201cCut 10% of your expenses.\u201d Maybe that means cutting 5% of your people and 20% of your contracts. So I worry about using headcount alone as a metric, because it doesn\u2019t tell the story. Maybe the right answer is we should have more FTEs and fewer contractors. That\u2019s a better solution for everybody: you\u2019ve retained the knowledge in the organization, it costs you less money. You referenced that memo we put out on strategic hiring. In my blog post , I was very clear that we would look favorably on increases in headcount that generate savings overall from a reduction in contractors. The reason for my \u201cmaybe\u201d is, honestly, I don\u2019t know what the right number is. The agencies know that better than I do. Part of this process is to hopefully push them to think about those trade-offs and get to a more optimal mix. I\u2019m going to give you a yes-and-no answer. The no part is the assumption that the existing headcount is optimal. It\u2019s hard to assume that. It\u2019s a misnomer to say, \u201cThe government was this well-oiled, massively efficient machine.\u201d If we\u2019re starting for an efficient organization, we end up cutting things, and we don\u2019t also revisit \u201cWhat are the actual deliverables for that organization?\u201d Then I agree. I\u2019m not trying to be argumentative. But there may be parts of the organization where we cut too many heads, and we didn\u2019t reset our expectations on what should be done. Therefor,e we made a mistake and we\u2019ve got to hire back those heads. This is not a broad statement, but the key assumption in my mind is, \u201cIs the government optimally maximized for efficiency?\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that controversial to say it was not. But the real way you get to efficiency is \u2014 I\u2019ll make this up. \u201cI\u2019m HHS. There\u2019s 20 things that I\u2019ve been doing for the last 20 years. These 10, we absolutely have to do, they\u2019re statutory, or they add a huge amount of value. Don\u2019t touch those things. These five, we need to do them, but the organization\u2019s not set up right, or we have too many people, or the metrics are wrong \u2014 let\u2019s go fix that. Then maybe there are five where the honest answer is, they\u2019re not statutory, they don\u2019t add value, and we should consider reducing them.\u201d In a good financial-planning process, all those things are required. How are you thinking about working with Congress on this? There has to be a legislative agenda. We do have that. We work with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), figure out the priorities, and then determine the right things to go forward. We\u2019re going through the budget process for 2027 right now. We have submitted what are the important priorities to OMB. We\u2019re waiting for passback \u2014 we\u2019re in the sausage-making on budget and priorities. There are things we cannot do without legislative authority. If we want to say, \u201cEverybody at General Schedule (GS)-15 should make $300,000 instead of $159,000 \u201d \u2014 I can\u2019t do that on my own. What we can do \u2014 which is part of the opportunity an"

    "keywords": "In the last few decades, few government interventions have been regarded as successes on both sides of the political aisle. Operation Warp Speed , which accelerated the development of COVID vaccines, is one. CHIPS, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors Act , is another. It spurred a massive investment boom in semiconductors on American soil. This was led by the CHIPS Program Office (CPO), at the Department of Commerce . The CPO had to decide how to allocate $39 billion of manufacturing incentives \u2014 and then negotiate the details with some of the biggest companies in the world. Today, I\u2019m lucky to have three of the founding members of the CHIPS Program Office team with me: Mike Schmidt , the inaugural Director, Todd Fisher , the Chief Investment Officer, and; Sara Meyers , Chief of Staff and Chief Operating Officer. Mike, Todd, and Sara have a clear sense of what went right for them, what went wrong, and what they\u2019d do differently the next time. They\u2019re working on a big project for IFP called Factory Settings , in which they describe what they learned. Subscribe to Factory Settings! Thanks to Katerina Barton and Harry Fletcher-Wood for their support on this episode. For a printable PDF of this interview, click here: Mike Schmidt : A bill passes, and what you\u2019re talking about is a startup. There\u2019s nothing \u2014 no people, no processes, no strategy. I was the first employee of the CHIPS team. I started in September 2022, about a month after the bill passed. On my first day of work, Secretary Gina Raimondo introduced me to Todd Fisher , who would become our Chief Investment Officer. The key imperatives were: Building a vision: how are you going to measure success? Building a team: we knew we needed an extraordinary group of people to help us get it done. Building a program: the nuts and bolts of how it\u2019s going to work. The early days were characterized by trying to figure those things out. Sara Myers : To design a program is to design hundreds of processes from scratch. We had a couple of things going for us in the beginning. We had 30 detailees from across the Commerce Department, trying to help us build the thing. We also had the attention of the senior operations and administrative folks around the Commerce Department , who understood that this was coming and that we were going to need to ramp quickly. Todd Fisher : The Secretary [ had a ] sense of urgency and a willingness to do unnatural things, including helping to recruit people \u2014 that was critical. Todd : This was obviously one of the biggest priorities for the Biden administration; one of, if not the, biggest priority for Secretary Raimondo. She viewed her role \u2014 and played it exceptionally well \u2014 as helping to break through barriers for us and be the lead recruiter. And the way the statute was created allowed us some flexibility in how we designed the program. Mike : The other thing we had was $780 million of administrative funding. Most people operating in government are hamstrung by budget. We expected to have to live within that budget for 20-30 years in total, and the spending would be more early on as we ramped up and allocated the funds. But in those early days, we knew we had the resources we needed to make it happen. Sara : I remember interviewing with you and being like, \u201cSo what do we have, resources-wise here?\u201d You were like, \u201cJust don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s a thing that you always must worry about in my experience. So what are you talking about?\u201d When you said $780 million, I was like, \u201cHe\u2019s not right. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\u201d How do you know CHIPS was a success? Mike : CHIPS was passed because semiconductor manufacturing capacity had declined pretty dramatically over the course of a few decades, from around 40% to around 10%. Semiconductors are foundational to the entire modern world. On the leading edge \u2014 the most advanced chips \u2014 production declined to zero. Those are the technologies that are most critical for AI, and the technology and geopolitics of the future. At leading-edge logic , which is a critical aspect of the supply chain, all the production is happening in Taiwan \u2014 a geography of intense geopolitical sensitivity. CHIPS is a bipartisan statement saying, \u201cWe have to reverse that trend. That is not sustainable from a national security standpoint. We need to onshore production of semiconductors, in particular leading-edge semiconductors.\u201d In terms of measuring success, one is we got it done: we allocated the funds. It\u2019s very hard to execute in government. In less than two and a half years, we awarded $34 billion, starting from nothing. That stands up to parallels in the private-equity world. Towards the end of the program, we were meeting with the Secretary weekly to go through the pipeline, deal by deal. She was turning the screws, as she should have, to make sure we were going to get it done \u2014 but also offering to help: \u201cWhat CEO can I call? How can I unlock this to help you guys get it done?\u201d We were walking out of her office one day \u2014 we knew we had 15 or 20 deals to close in the next few months. Todd worked at KKR , a renowned private-equity fund. I said, \u201cTodd, how many big deals do you think KKR will close between now and the end of the year?\u201d He was like, \u201cTwo or three.\u201d Todd : I think people don\u2019t understand what it takes to get a significant deal done. In the private-equity world, maybe a firm would get five or six transactions done in a year. But remember, all of the processes are in place: they have lawyers; they know all the terms that need to be agreed. We had to get the whole process out there: the application process, a portal, get applications in, evaluate and negotiate them \u2014 and get a final, signed agreement in place. Not to mention hiring 180 people, getting them integrated, and creating a team spirit. All those things are taken for granted. There\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t give $39 billion to a startup, because it\u2019s complicated to get it up and running. Mike : The other obvious measure of success: awarding funds doesn\u2019t matter unless that\u2019s having the outcome you want. We\u2019ve seen a massive amount of private investment catalyzed in semiconductor manufacturing here in the US: over $600 billion in announced investments . There are five companies in the world that can produce leading-edge chips: TSMC , Samsung , Intel , Micron , and SK Hynix . All five of them are expanding here. There\u2019s no other place in the world that has more than two of those companies. The scale of each individual investment is extraordinary. TSMC\u2019s investment is the largest foreign direct investment in the history of the country. Now it\u2019s $165 billion, but the $65 billion deal we signed with them was the largest. They\u2019ve announced the full plan to build out their site there, and plans to build out a second site. TSMC is producing leading-edge chips in the United States \u2014 the first time for any company in a decade \u2014 including the most advanced chips in the world, Nvidia Blackwell chips . It\u2019s still early innings. This is an initiative that will play out over the course of decades. But where we are in the game, it\u2019s looking pretty good. Todd : When the CHIPS Act was passed in 2022, the US produced exactly 0% of any leading-edge logic or memory chips \u2014 all of which are critical to AI, and to all GPUs that Nvidia manufactures, not to mention iPhones and other infrastructure. We are on target to produce \u2014 by the end of this decade \u2014 20% of all leading-edge logic chips in the world, and up to 10% of all leading-edge memory chips by some time in the mid-2030s. Those massive investments draw very significant investments up and down the supply chain, which creates ecosystems that become self-sustaining, which creates dynamism in the economy. We are not there, but all the announced deals, and what\u2019s being done on the ground now, should get us there in that timeframe. Mike : The Secretary said , on my first day of work \u2014 at the White House podium \u2014 we were going to put out our Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) in six months. A NOFO is how you describe what the application\u2019s going to look like, how you\u2019re going to evaluate it, how you\u2019re going to get your deals done \u2014 \u201cHere\u2019s what we want companies to do.\u201d So those early days are figuring out, \u201cHow is this thing going to work?\u201d We put out our Vision for Success . Mike : It\u2019s the basic architecture that you then have to fill out. As you\u2019re designing the big picture, you begin to think through the small picture. We were doing a lot of resource planning. Todd, you remember those early meetings with the Secretary? Todd : \u201cHow many people do we need?\u201d Mike : \u201cAre we going to be ready? When are the applications going to come in?\u201d Trying to project that out. Once the NOFO was out there in February of 2023, we wanted to be ready for contact. The funny thing was, it took companies longer to apply. There was this weird period over that summer of 2023 where we were waiting. There\u2019s plenty to do in terms of standing up the program and hiring the team. But it wasn\u2019t until late summer or fall of 2023 that we were actively evaluating and negotiating. Todd : We control when we put our funding opportunity out and the rules of the road. We don\u2019t control how fast someone responds. We set the process up so that these leading-edge companies could apply quicker than others, because we thought they were going to be ready to go. I think we got Intel\u2019s last application in September 2023 \u2014 six months after we put out the NOFO. You can\u2019t control these things. Sara : It was a little bit of a blessing, because by the time we hit June, we were at 100 people and we were reasonably ready to rock and roll. The development of the NOFO is the thing you negotiate with the interagency. That first six months \u2014 from August to January \u2014 there were five official employees, between 0\u201330 detailees, and negotiations with the interagency about what should be in and out. Mike : Six months to write a NOFO means three months to write a NOFO and three months of interagency negotiation. Mike : The White House set up some governance around the interagency that was hugely helpful. There was a CHIPS Coordinator that operated at the deputies level: Ronnie Chatterji [ who spoke to Statecraft a year ago ] and then Ryan Harper . The Coordinator was reporting into all the relevant principals: the Chief of Staff , the National Economic Council , NSC, and OSTP. We had a node of coordination. Still, the interagency is a lot. You write a NOFO and send it to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs . Your NOFO goes out, not only to every agency with a potential interest, but to every White House office that interacts with those agencies. For every subject area \u2014 national security, cyber, environmental \u2014 you\u2019ll have multiple sources of input, which might not always align. Sara : That\u2019s right. Then you\u2019re responsible for responding to everything. Mike : NASA wanted us to make clear that we\u2019d fund semiconductor investments both on Earth and in space. We were able to say, \u201cThe statute requires it to be in America, which is Earth.\u201d The way to move quickly is to accept comments. But if you accept every comment, you lose the thread on what you\u2019re trying to achieve. Sara : We didn\u2019t have to write a NOFO. The NOFO required us to go through the interagency process in that more fulsome and traditional way. It was a choice that offered us structure, and protection from critiques that we were doing it in isolation. But it added time to the work. Todd : Early on, we faced a bunch of criticism about \u201c Everything-Bagel Liberalism .\u201d Part of that is trying to find the balance between moving quickly and resolving interagency issues \u2014 and getting everything perfect. We had designed this in a way that allowed us to have a much more holistic approach [ to evaluating applications ]. We felt we could accept some of the comments from a bunch of the interagencies, move fast, and still have some flexibility as we made decisions. For the first six months, it was all about getting ourselves up and running, and putting rules of the road out for those who were going to apply. The next six months was about starting to engage out in the world with potential applicants, and pushing them on what we would like to see, until we finally get those applications in, and start to evaluate them. Phase three is the Preliminary Memorandum of Terms (PMT) stage. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got all these applications, how do we figure out how to enter into agreements on what these deals will look like, on a preliminary basis?\u201d That\u2019s a massive puzzle that you\u2019re trying to put together, and use your $39 billion in an effective way. That was another six or so months. The final stage is, once you have these PMTs, getting to legally binding agreements. That was a very tough process that got us to, at the end of the Biden administration, this $34 billion of deals. Mike : Todd brought it up, just to be clear. Thanks, Todd. I know all three of you have thoughts about that. Mike : The core thing that the criticism missed was that we had set up an evaluation and negotiation process that was iterative and holistic. Our North Star was economic and national security. We were very clear about what that meant in the Vision for Success . For childcare, the statute required that we asked for a workforce plan. Mike : I think that\u2019s fully appropriate. Workforce was a hugely important priority. We wanted to see childcare as part of that workforce plan. In terms of programmatic impact, I think we ended up getting some positive commitments from applicants. But it was not a sticking point. Mike : Definitely not childcare. I spent hundreds of hours negotiating with these companies. I probably spent 30 minutes talking about childcare. We thought that childcare, and workforce in general, was an important part of meeting our overall goals. Where we ran into problems is where there\u2019s an institutional actor outside of the Department of Commerce that controls your fate and that may have different incentives. Those can be real choke points. Todd : If you\u2019re doing industrial policy like this, where the main thing is national security, that needs to be the priority. It is hard to stop other priorities from inundating you when there\u2019s a lot of money around. We didn\u2019t get it perfectly right. If we\u2019re successful, CHIPS will drive jobs, but in my mind, it\u2019s not a jobs program. Micron, when this was all going about, was building a big childcare facility in Boise, because they recognized that in order to get people to come and work for them, they needed to provide childcare . If you go to Taiwan or Korea, all of these ecosystems have massive childcare facilities, because it is all about talent. If you talk to the companies about the biggest risk to this program, workforce is going to be in the top one or two. Mike : We had a fair amount of friction with applicants on requirements related to national security: cybersecurity, operational security, and the use of Chinese equipment. We were making some discretionary calls around what expectations we wanted to set, and they required a fair amount of negotiation. This is all on top of the national security requirements of the CHIPS Act, which constrained, for example, investment in manufacturing facilities in China. There were real trade-offs and healthy tension within our teams. Sara : Something that we rejected out of the interagency process: we were pushed pretty hard to say what recipients were going to have to report to us upfront, as is normally required in a NOFO. We were able to say, \u201cWe are not ready for that. We have so much more to figure out here.\u201d It ended up taking us two years to figure out exactly what that reporting was going to look like \u2014 how to make it not overly burdensome, and give us the data that we needed. Mike : I remember you calling me and explaining, \u201cWith the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), we\u2019re going to have to publish our reporting requirements for companies in the next few weeks.\u201d My reaction was, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not,\u201d because we knew these were commercial things: we were going to have to negotiate it. Whatever we were going to have to do \u2014 emergency PRA exemptions , whatever pain we were going to have to take with the Office of Management and Budget \u2014 was necessary. Sara : Designing what people are going to have to report is always a big deal in government. There\u2019s an inherent tension between getting everything the program might usefully use and anything that a recipient might want to do \u2014 it\u2019s a huge burden. As somebody who\u2019s been a recipient of federal dollars, all that reporting stuff might make sense to the federal agency. It makes zero sense to the people who have to do the reporting. PRA makes it so that you have to pretend you can understand the trade-offs between the burden and the benefit in advance. [Statecraft has covered the Paperwork Reduction Act\u2019s failings . ] In this context, it\u2019s even more complicated, because there are different deals, actors, and operating models on their side. Not to mention that we have to build the reporting system to ingest all this information. Todd : This is not an interagency thing, but there were lots of internal debates about stock buybacks . These were a big thing for certain parties on the left . Todd : Obviously none of our money could be used to do stock buybacks. That was in the statute. The question was, \u201cCan companies do stock buybacks at all?\u201d You\u2019re trying to incent the private sector. 5%-15% of the total money was coming from our office. The majority was being put in by these companies \u2014 who have to go out and talk to investors every single day. What you\u2019re focused on is getting these companies to make significant investments in the US. But if there\u2019s money after that, allowing them to give some back to shareholders is not crazy. Trying to focus on, \u201cWhat are we trying to do?\u201d and then allow companies to engage with the investors that they need \u2014 it was very complicated. Todd : Davis-Bacon was passed in 1931 \u2014 the Herbert Hoover administration \u2014 in an effort to create local construction worker markets. Many things about it are a bit anachronistic, but we all agree with the intent of trying to pay local construction workers the prevailing wage. The challenge is it had never been applied to something of this magnitude. There were tens of thousands of workers on a site like TSMC\u2019s in Arizona. They come in and out, because they\u2019re different types of contractors. We weren\u2019t paying for 100% \u2014 the companies were paying for a significant amount. We were trying to get people to start their work before they got their award, so we didn\u2019t lose time. That created a retroactive issue: \u201cWhat happens to all the work that was done before you got an award?\u201d That had never been dealt with at the federal level for Davis-Bacon. That was the challenge that we, the Labor Department , and others were trying to deal with. It\u2019s a whole administrative burden: how do you go back in time, for tens of thousands of workers, with thousands of subcontractors, and figure that out? Mike : The industry got that it was part of the deal \u2014 it was in the statute and manageable. For fabs under construction, our strategy was to say to companies, \u201cYou\u2019re building Fab One. We want you to build three fabs, so we\u2019ll fund a little bit of Fab One, and then use that as negotiating leverage to get commitments for Fabs Two and Three.\u201d But taking money on that first fab triggered this retroactivity issue. You need to look back at every contractor who\u2019s done work on that fab and figure out if they were paid Davis-Bacon wages. That requires tracking down potentially 20,000 employees who are no longer on the site. That administrative challenge was very difficult to work through with applicants. Mike : I think there\u2019s probably some similarities. Both NEPA and Davis-Bacon are governed outside of the implementing agency. Davis-Bacon by the Departm"

    "keywords": "If you\u2019re a scientist, and you apply for federal research funding, you\u2019ll ask for a specific dollar amount. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re asking for a million-dollar grant. Your grant covers the direct costs, things like the salaries of the researchers that you\u2019re paying. If you get that grant, your university might get an extra $500,000. That money is called \u201cindirect costs,\u201d but think of it as overhead: that money goes to lab space, to shared equipment, and so on. This is the system we\u2019ve used to fund American research infrastructure for more than 60 years. But earlier this year, the Trump administration proposed capping these payments at just 15% of direct costs, way lower than current indirect cost rates. There are legal questions about whether the admin can do that. But if it does, it would force universities to fundamentally rethink how they do science. The indirect costs system is pretty opaque from the outside. Is the admin right to try and slash these indirect costs? Where does all that money go? And if we want to change how we fund research overhead, what are the alternatives? How do you design a research system to incentivize the research you actually wanna see in the world? I\u2019m joined today by Pierre Azoulay 1 from MIT Sloan and Dan Gross from Duke\u2019s Fuqua School of Business. Together with Bhaven Sampat at Johns Hopkins, they conducted the first comprehensive empirical study of how indirect costs actually work. Earlier this year, I worked with them to write up that study as a more accessible policy brief for IFP . They\u2019ve assembled data on over 350 research institutions, and they found some striking results. While negotiated rates often exceed 50-60%, universities actually receive much less, due to built-in caps and exclusions. Moreover, the institutions that would be hit hardest by proposed cuts are those whose research most often leads to new drugs and commercial breakthroughs. Thanks to Katerina Barton, Harry Fletcher-Wood, and Inder Lohla for their help with this episode, to Matt Esche and Caleb Watney for their work on the graphs, and to Beez for her help translating this topic to a general audience. For a printable PDF of this interview, click here: I apply for a grant from the National Institutes of Health , or NIH. Where do indirect costs come in? Dan Gross: Research generally incurs two categories of costs, much as business operations do. Direct or variable costs are typically project-specific; they include salaries and consumable supplies. Indirect or fixed costs are not as easily assigned to any particular project. [ They include ] things like lab space, data and computing resources, biosecurity, keeping the lights on and the buildings cooled and heated \u2014 even complying with the regulatory requirements the federal government imposes on researchers. They are the overhead costs of doing research. Pierre Azoulay: You will use those grad students, mice, and test tubes, the direct costs. But you\u2019re also using the lab space. You may be using a shared facility where the mice are kept and fed. Pieces of large equipment are shared by many other people to conduct experiments. So those are fixed costs from the standpoint of your research project. Dan: Indirect Cost Recovery (ICR) is how the federal government has been paying for the fixed cost of research for the past 60 years. This has been done by paying universities institution-specific fixed percentages on top of the direct cost of the research. That\u2019s the indirect cost rate. That rate is negotiated by institutions, typically every two to four years, supported by several hundred pages of documentation around its incurred costs over the recent funding cycle. The idea is to compensate federally funded researchers for the investments, infrastructure, and overhead expenses related to the research they perform for the government. Without that funding, universities would have to pay those costs out of pocket and, frankly, many would not be interested or able to do the science the government is funding them to do. But as a researcher, I don\u2019t have to worry about what indirect costs are reimbursable. I\u2019m all mouse research, all day. Dan: These rates are as much of a mystery to the researchers as it is to the public. When I was junior faculty, I applied for an external grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) \u2014 you can look up awards folks have won in the award search portal . It doesn\u2019t break down indirect and direct cost shares of each grant. You see the total and say, \u201cWow, this person got $300,000.\u201d Then you go to write your own grant and realize you can only budget about 60% of what you thought, because the rest goes to overhead. It comes as a bit of a shock the first time you apply for grant funding. What goes into the overhead rates? Most researchers and institutions don\u2019t have clear visibility into that. The process is so complicated that it\u2019s hard even for those who are experts to keep track of all the pieces. Pierre: As an individual researcher applying for a project, you think about the direct costs of your research projects. You\u2019re not thinking about the indirect rate. When the research administration of your institution sends the application, it\u2019s going to apply the right rates. Dan: Duke University has a 61% indirect cost rate. If I propose a grant to the NSF for $100,000 of direct costs \u2014 it might be for data, OpenAI API credits, research staff salaries \u2014 I would need to budget an extra $61,000 on top for ICR, bringing the total grant to $161,000. Pierre: By and large, there aren\u2019t infrastructure grants in the science funding system. There are other things, such as center grants that fund groups of investigators. Sometimes those can get pretty large \u2014 the NIH grant for a major cancer center like Dana-Farber could be tens of millions of dollars per year. Dan: In the past, US science funding agencies did provide more funding for infrastructure and the instrumentation that you need to perform research through block grants. In the 1960s, the NSF and the Department of Defense were kicking up major programs to establish new data collection efforts \u2014 observatories, radio astronomy, or the Deep Sea Drilling project the NSF ran, collecting core samples from the ocean floor around the world. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) \u2014 back then the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) \u2014 was investing in nuclear test detection to monitor adherence to nuclear test ban treaties . Some of these were satellite observation methods for atmospheric testing. Some were seismic measurement methods for underground testing. ARPA supported the installation of a network of seismic monitors around the world. Those monitors are responsible for validating tectonic plate theory. Over the next decade, their readings mapped the tectonic plates of the earth. That large-scale investment in research infrastructure is not as common in the US research policy enterprise today. Dan: Santi, when were you born? Dan: So I\u2019m a good decade older than you \u2014 I was born in 1985. When we were learning tectonic plate theory in the 1990s, it seemed like something everybody had always known. It turns out that it had only been known for maybe 25 years. Dan: You applied for a grant to fund a specific project, whose contours you\u2019ve outlined in advance, and we provided the funding to execute that project. Pierre: You want to do some observations at the observatory in Chile , and you are going to need to buy a plane ticket \u2014 not first class, not business class, very much economy. What\u2019s the administration\u2019s argument here? Pierre: The argument is there are cases where foundations only charge 15% overhead rate on grants \u2014 and universities acquiesce to such low rates \u2014 and the federal government is entitled to some sort of \u201cmost-favored nation\u201d clause where no one pays less in overhead than they pay. That\u2019s the argument in this half-a-page notice. It\u2019s not much more elaborate than that. Dan: Whether you can extrapolate from that to federal research funding is a different question, let alone if federal research was funding less research and including even less overhead. Would foundations make up some of the difference, or even continue funding as much research, if the resources provided by the federal government were lower? Those are open questions. Foundations complement federal funding, as opposed to substitute for it, and may be less interested in funding research if it\u2019s less productive. Pierre: First, universities don\u2019t always say, \u201cYes\u201d [ to a researcher wishing to accept a grant ]. At MIT, getting a grant means getting special authorization from the provost. That special authorization is not always forthcoming. The provost has a special fund, presumably funded out of the endowment, that under certain conditions they will dip into to make up for the missing overhead. Pierre: That\u2019s my understanding. I know that if you\u2019re going to get a grant, you\u2019re going to have to sit in many meetings and cajole any number of administrators, and you don\u2019t always get your way. Second, it\u2019s not an apples-to-apples comparison [ between federal and foundation grants ] because there are ways to budget an item as a direct cost in a foundation grant that the government would consider an indirect cost. So you might budget some fractional access to a facility\u2026 Pierre: Yes, or some sort of Cryo-EM machine. You end up getting more overhead through the back door. The more fundamental way in which that approach is misguided is that the government wants its infrastructure \u2014 that it has contributed to through [ past ] indirect costs \u2014 to be leveraged by other funders. It\u2019s already there, it\u2019s been paid for, it\u2019s sitting idle, and we can get more bang for our buck if we get those additional funders to piggyback on that investment. Dan: That [ other funders ] might not be interested in funding otherwise. Dan: We\u2019re talking about an economies-of-scale problem. These are fixed costs. The more they\u2019re utilized, the more the costs get spread over individual research projects. For the past several decades, the federal government has funded an order of magnitude more university research than private firms or foundations. If you look at NSF survey data , 55% of university R&D is federally funded; 6% is funded by foundations. That is an order of magnitude difference. The federal government has the scale to support and extract value for whatever its goals are for American science. We haven\u2019t even started to get into the administrative costs of research. That is part of the public and political discomfort with indirect-cost recovery. The idea that this is money that\u2019s going to fund university bloat. But when you look at studies from a wide range of folks , it\u2019s obvious that R&D in American universities is hugely valuable. Federal R&D dollars more than pay for themselves. I want to leave room for all critiques of the scientific ecosystem, of the universities, of individual research ideas. But at this 30,000-foot level, federal R&D dollars are well spent. Dan: The evidence may suggest that, but that\u2019s not where the political and public dialogue around science policy is. Again, I\u2019m going to bring in a long arc here. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was, \u201cWe\u2019re in a race with the Soviet Union. If we want to win this race, we\u2019re going to have to take some risky bets.\u201d And the US did. It was more flexible with its investments in university and industrial science, especially related to defense aims. But over time, with the waning of these political pressures and with new budgetary pressures, the tenor shifted from, \u201cLet\u2019s take chances\u201d to \u201cLet\u2019s make science and other parts of government more accountable.\u201d The undercurrent of Indirect Cost Recovery policy debates has more of this accountability framing. This comes up in this comparison to foundation rates: \u201cIs the government overpaying?\u201d Clearly universities are willing to accept less from foundations. It comes up in this perception that ICR is funding administrative growth that may not be productive or socially efficient. Accountability seems to be a priority in the current day. Dan: Recent changes first kicked off on February 7th, when NIH posted its supplemental guidance , that introduced a policy that the direct cost rates that it paid on its grants would be 15% to institutions of higher education. That policy was then adopted by the NSF, the DOD, and the Department of Energy. All of these have gotten held up in court by litigation from universities . Things are stuck in legal limbo. Congress has presented its point of view that, \u201cAt least for now, I\u2019d like to keep things as they are.\u201d But this has been an object of controversy long before the current administration even took office in January. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going away. Pierre: If I had to guess, the proposal as it first took shape is not what is going to end up being adopted. But the idea that overhead rates are an object of controversy \u2014 are too high, and need to be reformed \u2014 is going to stay relevant. Dan: Partly that\u2019s because it\u2019s a complicated issue. Partly there\u2019s not a real benchmark of what an appropriate Indirect Cost Recovery policy should be. Any way you try to fund the cost of research, you\u2019re going to run into trade-offs. Those are complicated. ICR does draw criticism. People think it\u2019s bloated or lacks transparency. We would agree some of these critiques are well-founded. Yet it\u2019s also important to remember that ICR pays for facilities and administration. It doesn\u2019t just fund administrative costs, which is what people usually associate it with. The share of ICR that goes to administrative costs is legally capped at 26% of direct costs. That cap has been in place since 1991. Many universities have been at that cap for many years \u2014 you can see this in public records. So the idea that indirect costs are going up over time, and that that\u2019s because of bloat at US universities, has to be incorrect, because the administrative rate has been capped for three decades. Many of those costs are incurred in service of complying with regulations that govern research, including the cost of administering ICR to begin with. Compiling great proposals every two to four years and a new round of negotiations \u2014 all of that takes resources. Those are among the things that indirect cost funding reimburses. Even then, universities appear to under-recover their true indirect costs of federally-sponsored research. We have examples from specific universities which have reported detailed numbers. That under-recovery means less incentive to invest in infrastructure, less capacity for innovation, fewer clinical trials. So there\u2019s a case to be made that indirect cost funding is too low. Pierre: The bottom line is we don\u2019t know if there is under- or over-recovery of indirect costs. There\u2019s an incentive for university administrators to claim there\u2019s under-recovery. So I take that with a huge grain of salt. Dan: It\u2019s ambiguous what a best policy would look like, but this is all to say that, first, public understanding of this complex issue is sometimes a bit murky. Second, a path forward has to embrace the trade-offs that any particular approach to ICR presents. The other thing, which I want to hear more on, is that research tools seem to be becoming more expensive and complex. So the microscope I\u2019m using today is an order of magnitude more expensive than the microscope I was using in 1950. And you\u2019ve got to recoup those costs somehow. Pierre: Everything costs more than it used to. Research is subject to Baumol\u2019s cost disease . There are areas where there\u2019s been productivity gains \u2014 software has had an impact. The stakes are high because, if we get this wrong, we\u2019re telling researchers that they should bias the type of research they\u2019re going to pursue and training that they\u2019re going to undergo, with an eye to what is cheaper. If we reduce the overhead rate, we should expect research that has less fixed cost and more variable costs to gain in favor \u2014 and research that is more scale-intensive to lose favor. There\u2019s no reason for a benevolent social planner to find that a good development. The government should be neutral with respect to the cost structure of research activities. We don\u2019t know in advance what\u2019s going to be more productive. Pierre: There\u2019s a grain of truth to it. Dan: With what resources though? Who\u2019s incentivized to invest in this infrastructure? There\u2019s not a paid market for science. Universities can generate some licensing fees from patents that result from science. But those are meager revenue streams, realistically. There are reasons to believe that commercial firms are under-incentivized to invest in basic scientific research. Prior to 1940, the scientific enterprise was dramatically smaller because there wasn\u2019t funding the way that there is today. The exigencies of war drew the federal government into funding research in order to win. Then it was productive enough that folks decided we should keep doing it. History and economic logic tells us that you\u2019re not going to see as much science \u2014 especially in these fixed-cost heavy endeavors \u2014 when those resources aren\u2019t provided by the public. Pierre: My one possible answer to the question is, \u201cThe endowment is going to pay for it.\u201d MIT has an endowment, but many other universities do not. What does that mean for them? The administration also wants to tax the heck out of the endowment. Dan: Two decades ago, Pierre and Bhaven began collecting information on universities\u2019 historical indirect cost rates. This is a resource that was quietly sitting on the shelf waiting for its day. That day came this past February. Bhaven and Pierre collected information on negotiated ICR rates for the past 60 years. During this project, we also collected the most recent versions of those agreements from university websites to bring the numbers up to the current day. We pulled together data for around 350 universities and other research institutions. Together, they account for around 85% of all NIH research funding over the last 20 years.We looked at their: Negotiated indirect cost rates , from institutional indirect cost agreements with the government, and their; Effective rates [ how much they actually get when you look at grant payments ], using NIH grant funding data. Negotiated cost rates have gone up. That has led to concerns that the overhead cost of research is going up \u2014 these claims that it\u2019s funding administrative bloat. But our most important finding is that there\u2019s a large gap between the sticker rates \u2014 the negotiated ICR rates that are visible to the public, and get floated on Twitter as examples of university exorbitance \u2014 and the rates that universities are paid in practice, at least on NIH grants; we think it\u2019s likely the case for NSF and other agency grants too. An institution\u2019s effective ICR funding rates are much, much lower than their negotiated rates and they haven\u2019t changed much for 40 years. If you look at NIH\u2019s annual budget, the share of grant funding that goes to indirect costs has been roughly constant at 27-28% for a long time. That implies an effective rate of around 40% over direct costs. Even though many institutions have negotiated rates of 50-70%, they usually receive 30-50%. The difference between those negotiated rates and the effective rates seems to be due to limits and exceptions built into NIH grant rules. Those rules exclude some grants, such as training grants, from full indirect cost funding. They also exclude some direct costs from the figure used to calculate ICR rates. The implication is that institutions receive ICR payments based on a smaller portion of their incurred direct costs than typically assumed. As the negotiated direct cost falls, you see a university being paid a higher indirect cost rate off a smaller \u2014 modified \u2014 direct cost base, to recover the same amount of overhead. Dan: This is where we shift a little bit from assessment to speculation. W"

    "keywords": "Today we\u2019re joined by David Schleicher . David is Professor of Property and Urban Law at Yale Law School, and an expert in local government law, land use, finance, and urban development. I found David\u2019s book, In a Bad State: Responding to State and Local Budget Crises , a fascinating and readable primer on municipal debt: what it is, how it grows, and how cities can face up to it. Municipal pension funding may not sound like the most fascinating topic, but I hope this conversation illustrates two things: First, how our pension systems work matters to all of us \u2014 whether or not we are enrolled in a municipal pension. Second, these questions go to the heart of how our cities are run, why they fail, and how they can be improved. In the sections on Chicago, I\u2019m drawing on coverage from sources including the Chicago Tribune , A City That Works , Illinois Policy , friend-of-Statecraft Judge Glock , the WSJ , and Austin Berg , among others. Thanks to Harry Fletcher-Wood and Katerina Barton for their judicious transcript and audio edits. For a printable PDF of this interview, click here: So, David, if we\u2019re not future pensioners, why should we care how state and local governments run their pension systems? To the extent that jurisdictions spend a lot on it, they\u2019re not spending money on other things. When a pension system is indebted, you\u2019re paying for services you received in the past. We\u2019re paying, not only for our school system today, but for our older school system. That means we can invest less in today\u2019s system, because we still have to pay off the money we effectively borrowed when we employed people in the \u201870s and didn\u2019t save for their pensions. It has an effect on budgets; it limits what jurisdictions can otherwise buy. A pension is just a form of deferred compensation. When you work for any employer, they pay your salary and something for retirement. People who are used to a 401(k) or a 401(k) match understand that the company might help you with retirement. State and local pensions are traditionally not \u201cdefined contribution\u201d but defined benefit . If you work for a certain amount of time, you get some kind of annuity \u2014 a certain amount of money every year \u2014 that begins when you retire. The idea is that the employer will save money while you work, they\u2019ll invest it, and they\u2019ll have enough money when you retire to pay for this annuity every year. Governments have always offered some kind of pension \u2014 there are Civil War pensions. But the modern system of state and local pensions really takes off in the 1950s, \u201860s, and particularly the \u201870s. A couple of things happen to make it different and notable. The first one is you see public employee unions asking for pensions in negotiations. You start seeing bigger pensions offered. The second thing is a legal change. Prior to this period, it differed by state, but pensions were called in the law a \u201cmere gratuity.\u201d The government offered them, but then could just not pay them if they wanted to. Then states \u2014 through constitutional amendments or judicial decisions \u2014 gave pensions the status of either contract or property. What this meant was that they couldn\u2019t not pay them. Pensions had the same legal status as debt, and they were protected by state constitutions and the federal Constitution\u2019s Contract Clause . Some states went further than this and adopted the California Rule : The pension you\u2019ve already earned is guaranteed by law, and any potential future earnings you have under your current pension policy are also guaranteed, and can\u2019t be changed unless there\u2019s an offsetting benefit. In a California Rule state, which includes New York, Illinois, and a bunch of other states, if you start working as a teacher aged 24, your pension policy can\u2019t be changed until your retirement, unless it\u2019s made better or there\u2019s some offsetting benefit. Normally, a person borrows money to get an asset, like a house, and governments borrow money to build a bridge. Traditional debt is limited by debt limits. State constitutions have rules governing when debt is issued. Many readers have voted in a debt election, where there\u2019s a bond on the ballot: \u201cShould we borrow $10 million to build a swimming pool?\u201d By contrast, pension debt \u2014 workers worked, but you didn\u2019t save the money for the retirement you are legally required to pay \u2014 isn\u2019t covered by these debt limits. In some jurisdictions, it is a particularly attractive place to hide deficits. If you\u2019re legally required to balance your budget and you can\u2019t, underfunding your pension system is a way to bury your fiscal imbalances, by borrowing that is not limited or regulated. You underfund your pensions. You can do it in all sorts of ways. The biggest way jurisdictions have done this is say in their pension accounting that they\u2019re going to get a big return every year. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get 8% returns every year.\u201d They might, but they might not. Sometimes it\u2019s good. But because you\u2019re legally required to pay, an economist would say you should assume the \u201c risk-free rate of return .\u201d If you have an absolute legal obligation to pay something, you can\u2019t take the risk that it\u2019s not going to be there. You\u2019re supposed to account for only those returns that you\u2019d get if you invested in Treasury bills. But that\u2019s not how any jurisdiction works. There are other things you can do to hide how indebted you are, or just get yourself more indebted. We haven\u2019t had a state default since the 1930s, because states have extraordinary taxing powers. They can raise the income taxes to very high rates \u2014 if they want to. That\u2019ll cause some exit and some problems. What it means to not be able to pay is an interesting question. Take Detroit. Legally, states can\u2019t file for bankruptcy. Cities can. Detroit did file for bankruptcy under Chapter Nine . But at the moment it filed for bankruptcy, it wasn\u2019t unable to make its next payment \u2014 it probably could have, if it sold City Hall. It just would\u2019ve meant that it couldn\u2019t make its future payments. The legal requirement for bankruptcy is insolvency, which is understood to mean not making your payments and not able to make future payments. But what that means is not obvious. Courts, in the case of Detroit \u2014 this is interesting and weird \u2014 created an idea called service-delivery insolvency . It was first created for Stockton , California. It was a rule that said, \u201cIf your services get too bad, then we\u2019re not going to make you pay on your debts.\u201d What \u201ctoo bad\u201d meant in this context is not clear. They note in the case \u2014 it takes an ambulance an hour to get to you, it\u2019s really bad. But if you are in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, who knows how long it takes an ambulance to get to. It might take three months. There are no positive rights in these state constitutions. Education\u2019s a little different, but there is no right to a level of policing service. But what happens if you can\u2019t pay differs by jurisdiction. States have sovereign immunity: you can\u2019t sue them in their own courts, or federal courts, unless they allow you to. You can\u2019t make them pay. What happens when a state defaults? Mostly, nothing \u2014 except that they have trouble borrowing for a long time. With cities, they could be forced to pay, but the state can authorize them to file for bankruptcy. It\u2019s true. But also \u201cservice-delivery insolvency\u201d \u2014 a court just created it out of whole cloth in the mid-2010s. It\u2019s not in the law. The law says \u201cinsolvency,\u201d but in order to understand what insolvency means, they insert this wonk-speak, which is not in the statute. It serves a purpose, but it\u2019s just made up. There\u2019s a wonk-to-law channel going through the judicial opinion. This problem emerges in these cases. The courts are struggling with it, and it\u2019s not obvious how to handle them. I don\u2019t think that what they\u2019re doing is best understood as applying a legal test. They\u2019re saying, \u201cWhen are things so bad that we\u2019re going to allow you to use bankruptcy?\u201d In it, you tell a story of a world a couple years from now, where Illinois and Chicago leadership call a joint press conference and say, \u201cWe\u2019re bankrupt. We need the feds to step in and bail us out. The pensions are completely underfunded. Teachers, police, and civil servants won\u2019t get paid unless the feds step in.\u201d What would happen next? The book sets out three possible federal responses. Bailout . We\u2019ve done it a number of times over the course of American history. A jurisdiction is on the edge of bankruptcy, and the federal government \u2014 or, with respect to a city, a state government \u2014 offers it a bunch of money. Probably the most famous fiscal crisis in American history is the first major one. The states were on the edge of bankruptcy, and Alexander Hamilton and the federal government assumed the state debts . Creditor loss . The federal government could provide a legal mechanism or otherwise force the creditors to eat the loss. This is bankruptcy, but there are other tools that do this as well, that make it hard for people to recover against governments that they\u2019ve lent to. 1 Austerity . Enforce those contracts very aggressively and also not offer bailouts. The loser then would be the people. The jurisdiction would have to raise taxes, cut spending, and sell everything. Maybe that won\u2019t be enough, in the case of a small local government. But Illinois has extraordinary taxing authority. This would be very costly. It would be a huge spending cut during an economic decline. In a decline, people have greater need for social welfare services. You\u2019d be cutting those. Over the course of American history, governments have toggled between bailout, austerity, and credit loss. It\u2019s the problem of moral hazard . If we offer bailouts, everyone will get themselves into trouble, so that they get bailouts. This can operate through two channels. The traditional idea is that governors will look around and say, \u201cThey\u2019re getting a bailout. We should also be spendthrifts and get a bailout.\u201d The degree to which that happens is debated, because you\u2019re making predictions across time. Does anyone say, \u201c40 years ago New York City got a bailout . Therefore, I will get it\u201d? The other mechanism for that moral hazard is bond markets. Lenders can say, \u201cWhen push comes to shove, they always get a bailout.\u201d There\u2019s a good bit of evidence that that channel works. One example is, a bunch of states got into fiscal trouble in the late 1830s. Nicholas Biddle \u2014 who, for American history buffs, was the head of the Second Bank \u2014 after the end of that bank, he\u2019s still the head of the US Bank of Pennsylvania . He goes to London and says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about your Pennsylvania bonds. The federal government always bails out states.\u201d Then they didn\u2019t. There are credit default swaps on some municipal bonds. They\u2019re generally pretty thinly traded. There are technical reasons why an actual short, to do with the reason people like to hold them: interest on municipal bonds is tax-exempt. Changing hands would change who would gain income from them, so it means that shorting is quite difficult. That\u2019s the broad story, but it\u2019s just not a thing. There\u2019s no mechanism. The default rate in municipal bonds is extraordinarily low. There have been many historical instances where that\u2019s not true. In the Great Depression, there was a huge number of defaults of municipal bonds. In the 1860s and 1870s, after the Civil War, municipal bonds were defaulting left and right. The default rate is quite low on municipal bonds: it\u2019s in the 1% rate. The big spike involved Puerto Rican municipal bonds . So another reason these markets don\u2019t develop is because it seems pretty unlikely. This is a famous case \u2014 I don\u2019t mean it\u2019s Taylor Swift famous. Chicago has four separate pension funds. All are in dire shape: The Chicago Municipal \u2014 the regular civil servant pension system \u2014 is one of the worst-funded in the country. The Chicago public schools operate one of the most underfunded teacher pension plans . Illinois has the worst-funded state pension system in the country. No major US city has a worse credit rating than Chicago. It\u2019s got more pension debt than 43 US states. 7 of the 10 worst-funded local pension systems in the nation are in Illinois. How does something like that happen? In the 1970s, the big question was why was Chicago so fiscally well run. There\u2019s a wonderful book by political scientist Ester Fuchs called Mayors and Money . Why did New York go bankrupt when Chicago didn\u2019t? The answer she gives is that in New York, the political machine died, and the result was no centralizing function: they gave money to everybody. Whereas in Chicago, people were either for or against the Daley machine. That machine had an incentive not to get into a lot of fiscal trouble, because if it did, it would be punished politically. One of the ironies is that Chicago\u2019s fiscal troubles get a lot worse when Daley\u2019s son is the mayor. He\u2019s a much weaker political figure, and ends up spending more than they have across multiple dimensions. Pension debt is the biggest, but Daley also sold off parking meter revenues to balance the budget. Selling off future revenues is not debt, but it\u2019s like debt. All it takes to have a pension crisis is to have budget deficits forever. In Chicago\u2019s case, they also offer rich pensions. But to have a pension debt, you don\u2019t need to have particularly expensive pensions; You just need to not save money for them. Some jurisdictions have very expensive pensions. New York State has a pretty well-funded pension system : they have very high taxes and they pay for them. Chicago has just not saved enough. Unlike the federal government, they can\u2019t print money to solve their problems, and they don\u2019t have the taxing power: people can leave Chicago \u2014 many people do. They pay out the teachers every year. But the increasing amounts they have to, or should, pay on their pension squeezes what they can pay on everything else. That amount of money they can pay for other things shrinks every year. Eventually the piper has to get paid. That\u2019s what it actually pays. Never mind what it should pay. To amortize the debt over time, it should be paying a lot more. You are really talking about all of the money. In theory, the state could authorize them to raise taxes. Chicago already has quite high property and sales taxes. Chicago voters turned down \u2014 I thought it was pretty poorly conceived \u2014 a property transfer tax recently, that was designed to pay for an additional set of programs. There are just limits to how much people will pay in tax. At some level, you start to see exit and economic pain. The studies on flight are really interesting. They are usually about top-end personal tax increases. The evidence is that there\u2019s a very little bit of flight in response. Part of the challenge is that all these studies are pre-COVID and pre-Zoom. Whether that changes things is a little unclear. The social meaning is a little more complicated. One thing is the tax rate going up 2%. Another thing is the message, \u201cYou\u2019re not wanted.\u201d I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with exit. But one of the challenges for these jurisdictions is a lack of entry. I\u2019m thinking about New York. Their share of the richest 1% has declined over time . A little bit of that is exit, but some of it is the absence of entrance. As we see greater income inequality, one person can be a big deal. There\u2019s a famous story involving a very rich person named David Tepper . He owns Charlotte Football Club and the Carolina Panthers. He left New Jersey and the lost tax revenue was a big deal . Ironically, he moved back during COVID. In addition to the exit questions, it\u2019s just economically punishing to have higher taxes and worse services. If you actually try to pay back your pensions \u2014 as opposed to getting a bailout or stiffing the investors \u2014 the result is a depressing politics for a long time, where you\u2019re spending less and taxing more. Connecticut is remarkable. It was one of the most underfunded pension systems, but since the late 2010s it has been extraordinarily responsible . It\u2019s a much more complicated story about budget controls and bond covenants, but they\u2019ve saved a lot of money every semester. The result of this is they\u2019re neither cutting taxes \u2014 they cut taxes a little bit last session, but not this session \u2014 and they\u2019re not raising spending. It\u2019s just a downer. Another way of saying this is you start thinking about generations. Why is politics so depressing in Connecticut? The boomers spent all the money and we\u2019re paying off their debts. But Chicago might be much worse than that. It\u2019s more than just something that can be solved by making your politics a little bit of a downer for a couple of years. Pensions are in much better shape now than they were 10 years ago. We\u2019ve been discussing the pension crisis for a long time, and the last number of years have been quite good for state budgets. A good bit of it. The states got a huge amount of money from the federal government. They were not supposed to spend any of it saving for pensions, but they made their pension payments. Even the most spendthrift ones \u2014 New Jersey would issue press releases , \u201cWe made our pension payment this year.\u201d Which is like issuing a press release, \u201cI paid my credit card.\u201d You\u2019re supposed to! State budgets were in bad shape before, but they\u2019re not getting worse in most places. The desire to hide budget deficits has gone down. In terms of jurisdictions, Illinois and Chicago are much, much worse than all the others. There are other measurements you could use that have Connecticut and New Jersey in bad shape, but those are the richest places in the history of Christendom. Their ability to bear the debt is better. The real problem of Chicago is that the city has these unbelievably indebted pension systems \u2014 18% funded. But then they\u2019ve got the school districts. The complex relationship between those two entities \u2014 who\u2019s borrowing to help who \u2014 is the subject of a huge fight right now. But the overlaying \u2014 the city, the school district, the parks district, the county, the transit district, the state \u2014 leads to nesting dolls of debts. From the perspective of a taxpayer, you have to pay out all of it. This is something people don\u2019t often realize about jurisdictions, but when most people pay their property taxes, they are paying to multiple jurisdictions. In Illinois, people will pay taxes to 13 separate jurisdictions that are overlapping in complex ways. How does something like that pass unanimously, when every accountant looks at it says, \u201cThis is horrifying\u201d? Chicago has what are called tiers of pensions . This is driven by the fact that they can\u2019t change pensions policy for current workers at all. There\u2019s a great Illinois Supreme Court case where they tried to do this, and the court said, \u201cYou can\u2019t change things for current workers.\u201d What they do is create a new tier when they want to cut pension spending going forward. They create these second tiers for workers. Those workers \u2014 who are doing the same jobs as previously-hired workers \u2014 will be earning pensions according to a different policy. What this did was change the policy for one of those tiers of workers to make it more like the other tiers of workers. It made it sweeter. But remember this is happening for police officers and firefighters. One side of this argument is scolds\u2026 Exactly. \u201cThis is going to be a problem in the future! My bow tie is out of whack!\u201d The other side of this argument is the extremely powerful moral claims of police officers and firefighters who\u2019ve been putting their bodies at risk for you, the citizenry. The problem is accruing over time, but probably won\u2019t come to a head this year, or next year, or maybe not for fifteen years. Current officials face incentives where it\u2019s, \u201cShould I help out the firefighter today? Or should I think about the fiscal health of the city twenty years from now?\u201d This dynamic is exactly the central problem. The Illinois legislature \u2014 when they we"

    "keywords": "Today we\u2019re joined by Judd Devermont , one of the most experienced Africa policy hands in Washington. He spent 16 years as an intelligence analyst, serving in both the Obama and Biden administrations. Most recently, he was Senior Director for African Affairs at the National Security Council. He authored the Biden administration\u2019s Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa . Since leaving government in early 2024, he writes a newsletter called Post Strategy , reflecting on what works and what doesn\u2019t in US policy toward Africa. This conversation is about the mechanics of diplomacy: how US engagement with Africa actually works, and why it falls short. Judd explains diplomatic \u201ccare and feeding\u201d \u2014 the constant effort required to maintain relationships with African countries, while competing for presidential attention with Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. I wanted Judd\u2019s perspective on American goals for diplomacy in Africa, but also his honest appraisal of where the administrations he served in failed to execute, and what he wished he\u2019d done differently. Why do presidential initiatives in Africa fail so often? Does the National Security Council deserve to be cut down to size? Why do CIA analysts have such a high opinion of themselves, and is it warranted? How should you negotiate with a military junta? We get into all this and more, and Judd was very game to argue with me about all of it. What \u201ccare and feeding\u201d means in diplomacy What went wrong with the relationships with Niger The problem with envoys Whether the NSC has been neutered under Trump Why most intelligence analysis doesn\u2019t cut it anymore Thanks to Harry Fletcher-Wood, Katerina Barton, and Rona Fe Cruz for their support in producing this episode. For a printable PDF of this interview, click here: I want to start with a thought experiment. Let\u2019s imagine that you get to reallocate American diplomatic resources globally. You\u2019re being asked to rebalance how much focus, attention, and touch different regions get, but you\u2019re not allowed to increase the total amount of diplomatic resources or staffing. Do you put more resources into Africa? If so, from where do you pull them? It\u2019s hard for me not to say, \u201cPut more resources in Africa,\u201d so I won\u2019t be provocative or disappoint. Currently, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re doing enough for our national security interests, based on how much effort and time we put into Africa. I experienced this throughout my career as an intelligence officer in the Obama and Biden administrations. There come times where we are at a crunch point and someone says, \u201cWe need to get the Africans on board,\u201d or, \u201cHow can we work with the Africans on this critical issue?\u201d Or there\u2019s a problem that\u2019s developing in Africa and it\u2019s in our interest to be able to resolve it. We haven\u2019t done the legwork, because we said that Africa as an area of focus is near zero, and I think that\u2019s really problematic. Let\u2019s pretend that the value of Africa is X. I would bump it up by 10 points and give us the opportunity to have that grow as the continent becomes more significant. Then I would question, \u201cDo we need to put as much effort in parts of the Global North, like Europe, as we do?\u201d There\u2019s too much legacy in the investment in Europe and not enough investment in where the bulk of the population of the world is, which is in the Global South. We have an extraordinary amount of alignment with the European partners already, or at least we certainly did pre-Trump. So some of the care and feeding that we do with the Europeans, and the endless amount of touch points and high-level meetings that they get, are probably unnecessary to have the same outcome. Meanwhile, the kinds of investments we need to make in Africa to have outcomes that are in our interest are insignificant. Meanwhile, many of our allies and adversaries are spending more effort in Africa. They are getting more trade, and alignment in international forums. They are getting the benefit of voices supporting their positions and their vision of the world. I\u2019m not discounting the importance of France or Great Britain. What I\u2019m saying is that you probably don\u2019t need to put as much effort into those relationships for the same results. If you don\u2019t put more effort into our partnerships with Africans, we are going to miss out in the future. What we\u2019re mainly talking about is senior-level engagement. Who gets to go to the White House? Who gets a visit by a senior US official? For too many countries in Africa, the most senior US official they will ever meet is the ambassador of that country. If you don\u2019t have a peer-to-peer relationship with Africans, it is going to be to your detriment. I\u2019ll tell you a story from a couple of decades ago. President George H.W. Bush was trying to cultivate [ UN ] votes ahead of the Persian Gulf War against Saddam Hussein . C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire [ also known as Ivory Coast ] was on the Security Council , and the foreign minister of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Amara Essy , comes to Washington and meets with Secretary Baker . Essy says, \u201cI\u2019ve been to Washington countless times, and until today, I have never met with anybody higher than the assistant secretary of state.\u201d Baker, to his credit, was like, \u201cWe will change that. Next time you are in New York or you\u2019re here, I will meet with you. I\u2019ll come up to meet you in New York, or I\u2019ll bring you down by train.\u201d Here we were, at the precipice of a critical vote and the foreign minister of a country had only met with \u2014 an important figure in African policy, but in the scheme of things, not a very senior official. Think about the other way: what if the US president, or Secretary of State Blinken , went to an African country and they said, \u201cYou can meet with this guy in the middle of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the desk officer for the US.\u201d That\u2019s what I mean by care and feeding: accruing mutual respect to people who are your equals. Presidential meetings with African leaders, from Devermont\u2019s post, \u201c On the Oval Office \u201d President George W. Bush was remarkable in the post-Cold War era with how many African leaders that he met with. I have found in my research that that\u2019s correlated with a whole bunch of different things, including major development programs, travel, consultations on the biggest global issues. A lot of this goes credit to President Bush, as a leader. But also I found a nice quote from him that said Condoleezza Rice told him when he took office, he\u2019s going to be spending more time with Africans and with Africa. And he really did that. A colleague of mine told this story to me: President Bush met with President Museveni of Uganda. President Bush asked Museveni about his views on the Iraq war. Later he was asked, \u201cWhy did you bring up the conflict in Iraq?\u201d Bush said, \u201cI read his bio. He was an insurgent leader, and we\u2019re leading a counterinsurgency. I wanted to get his firsthand insights.\u201d I love that story because there he is, not just doing African issues with President Museveni, he\u2019s talking about the biggest topics that are top-of-mind for him. That\u2019s phenomenal. African presidents who visited their US counterparts in the Oval Office, 1961\u20132025 You asked a bigger question: why has there been less engagement from the post-Cold War presidents vs. the Cold War presidents? For the most part \u2014 outside of George W. Bush \u2014 I don\u2019t think that there has been a real connection with why Africa\u2019s important. In the Cold War \u2014 this is crazy \u2014 President Kennedy spent 25% of all foreign leader meetings with Africans. He truly believed that if we were going to shape the Cold War and the international order, we had to be working with Africans. Not only did he engage with Africans, he established USAID and the Peace Corps . For me, those two presidents stand above all the others. That\u2019s really hard. I feel conflicted loyalties. I\u2019ll tell you what I thought was a strength of President Obama\u2019s administration on Africa and I\u2019ll tell you what went right with President Biden. For President Obama: not just his own background in connection to Kenya \u2014 I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s relevant here. He had a bunch of senior leaders in the Cabinet who also thought Africa was important: National Security Advisor Susan Rice had been assistant secretary for Africa. Head of USAID Gayle Smith had been a senior director for Africa [ on the National Security Council ] in the Clinton administration. Samantha Power , in New York, had spent time thinking about Africa. That allowed us to do some big programs, like Power Africa , or the Young African Leaders Initiative , or decide that we are going to send the military to the West Coast of Africa to deal with Ebola over anyone\u2019s objections. Those were the things that were working in the Obama administration. Sometimes there was a little too much preachiness about Africa, and in ways that \u2014 we don\u2019t do it anywhere else in the world. We have complex, complicated relationships with India, or the United Arab Emirates, or Vietnam, and we don\u2019t do as much lecturing. But the Obama administration in Africa, there was a little too much of that. In the Biden administration I think we did less lecturing. But we did less engagement. I\u2019m proud of a lot of the things that we did, particularly in terms of, \u201cHow do we get Africans to have a bigger voice in international forum?\u201d Getting the African Union to join the G20 , calling for African seats at the UN Security Council. But I don\u2019t think there was enough of an echo chamber around President Biden to break through \u2014 to get the engagement we needed on the continent. Also, the war in Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza were huge sucking sounds, and they really strapped the bandwidth. I do think that Jake Sullivan and Tony Blinken would [ have done ] more on Africa, but they were pretty limited given how much those two particular conflicts, as well as competition with China, was limiting the space for other engagement. Maybe there\u2019s one more point, Santi, on the rhetoric. Those of us who focus on Africa, in some respects, often we write checks that we can\u2019t cash. We hope that we can cash them. We write them down so that we can use them as a bludgeon, to push people to get to them. But at the end of our administration, we\u2019re stuck with some very aspiring rhetoric about where we want to take the relationship, and then the reality that we didn\u2019t meet that. Partly that was because we couldn\u2019t drive the system to get to where we had hoped to be at the end of the day. You worked with Phee. What was your read on that encounter? I left the administration in February of 2024; the Niger coup had happened in July [ 2023 ], and I was in a number of meetings where we knew that we had to engage the junta about the direction that they were taking. We wanted to see a pathway back to democratic rule \u2014 although we were flexible about how long that would take, we wanted it to be a conversation. We had this outstanding issue about the future of our military bases, both in the capital and in Agadez , and some concerning information about our foreign adversaries. I can\u2019t speak to what happened in that meeting, because I wasn\u2019t there. I do know the intention was to say: \u201cHow do we find a way forward together? We\u2019re under our own domestic constraints, as much as you are as the junta: in terms of things that you\u2019re promising your populace, or the justifications you\u2019re giving for your coup, and your dissatisfaction with a number of relationships that you have. How do I identify the things that are making it even more difficult? Is there a way forward on that?\u201d That was the intent of the conversation. What is missed sometimes in the public conversation is that we weren\u2019t saying, \u201cDon\u2019t have a relationship with Russia.\u201d We were trying to be very specific about the things that would be concerning to us \u2014 considering that we have military bases and operations in Niger \u2014 there may be certain types of weaponry that the Russians want to provide, or access the Russians want, that would be problematic for our ability to maneuver. We actually had more flexibility and openness to thinking about these arrangements than sometimes is given credit. We wanted to understand what their ultimate trajectory was towards democracy; what was going to be the final disposition of the former head of state, Mohamed Bazoum , who is still, to this day, under house arrest. But when I left in February, our goal was to have this conversation in person so we can figure out a way forward. Let\u2019s express our concerns and where we think we can partner. I don\u2019t think that is paternalistic. Again, I don\u2019t know what happened in that meeting. Obviously the outcome and the perception of that meeting is not very good, and it\u2019s not where I would\u2019ve liked us to be. I\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s the conversation that I had when I met with the coup leader in Gabon. I led the delegation. We talked about the things that are important to us and to them: \u201cCan we find a way forward?\u201d We largely have; they\u2019ve transitioned back to civilian rule . The military junta leader is now the president, but they did it in two years. It\u2019s faster than any of the countries in the Sahel, and we\u2019re having constant engagements with them. The relationships with Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso \u2014 it\u2019s a much slower process and there\u2019s a lot of hurt feelings on both sides perhaps, and a lot of sensitivities. There\u2019s two villains here. Villain number one is the generalist who says: \u201cAfrica\u2019s too complicated, just give me the good news stories. Let\u2019s have the heroes, the saints, the countries that represent values that we cherish. Let\u2019s have them have the meetings, so they could stand up as some sort of exemplar or totem of what we want to be. These countries that are really complicated, these leaders that have past that we don\u2019t agree with, let\u2019s not spend time with them.\u201d That\u2019s the generalist side and I\u2019m talking about both politicals and civil servants. On the other side, there\u2019s the Africanists who also play this game, who just want us to make sure that we\u2019re rewarding good behavior. I had a meeting with an ambassador who told me, \u201cWhy are you guys even considering a meeting with that guy? Don\u2019t you know how bad he is? You should be meeting with my leader from my country.\u201d Instead of an argument on the merits of what the problems are that we were going to address in the Oval Office, he was trying to figure out who had more virtue, which is crazy. That\u2019s a dynamic and I\u2019ve seen it play out so many times where, even when you have US presidents who aren\u2019t spending a lot of time on human rights issues, people below them will say, \u201cShould we really be engaging with this leader? I read a Human Rights Watch report, or this cable, and it looks like they\u2019re pretty bad.\u201d I would pull my hair out \u2014 I don\u2019t have much hair, but what I had \u2014 because the day before that, the president engaged with a leader from the Middle East, or Southeast Asia, or Latin America, who had an equally torrid past. There\u2019s a lot of double standards in the African engagement space. It\u2019s not to our benefit. One last point, because it gets back to how many leaders that you have in the Oval Office. This is where I did have a problem. If I was only going to get four African political leaders in the Oval Office \u2014 if I was only going to be allotted one or two a year \u2014 then I was going to pick Nigeria, South Africa, and Angola, or Kenya. I didn\u2019t have the luxury of saying, \u201cLet\u2019s bring in a variety of leaders,\u201d in the way that President Bush or Kennedy did. That is one of the challenges when you\u2019re only given so many slots \u2014 it\u2019s never explicit \u2014 then you are being more careful. You\u2019re not only trying to get the most strategic countries in there, which is a good thing, but you\u2019re not willing to take the risk of having the country and the leader who you\u2019re going to get a lot of hell from the Hill from, or from activists, or the bureaucracy. That\u2019s the third dynamic that I want to be confessional about. A couple of things happen. Sometimes, after you have a big meeting like the Africa Leaders Summit , you\u2019re told, \u201cDon\u2019t bother us for a while.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s by the people who run the access to the president, or people who have to rack and stack all the foreign leaders. \u201cYou had a great event. I\u2019m very thankful that we had that event, but take a beat for a little while.\u201d That\u2019s one of the ways it\u2019s done. The other way, which is a little more subtle, is, \u201cWe put this list together. Your country was on it. It didn\u2019t make the cut line. We were told we didn\u2019t have ten, we have five, so you dropped off.\u201d You start realizing that you\u2019re only going to get a couple of these, at least in my experience, and you\u2019re going to have to be persistent about it. One of the things that I did as a trick is that I would send a request. I would be told, \u201cNo.\u201d I would send a second request. I would be told, \u201cNo.\u201d Then I would say to myself, \u201cI\u2019m really uncomfortable that I keep asking for this, so I definitely need to do it one more time.\u201d You just have to keep pushing and try to keep refining the arguments and not give up. You have to be that pain in the ass. But maybe in retrospect, I needed to be a bigger pain in the ass. So the Corporate Council on Africa (CCA) \u2014 which is not a US government institution \u2014 has an annual business forum . Sometimes they do it in the United States, sometimes in Africa. They just did one in Angola, next year it\u2019s going to be Mauritius. In 2023 it was in Botswana. The council and the government of Botswana work together to decide who\u2019s on the invite list. Because Zimbabwe, which is Botswana\u2019s neighbor, is part of a larger regional grouping called the Southern African Development Community , they were on the list. They were there for the 2019 summit in Mozambique, we were all fine with that. There\u2019s a sanctions program on Zimbabwe, and there was an uproar by different parts of the federal government legislative branch about the fact that a sanctioned individual, the President of Zimbabwe, was going to be there. We would\u2019ve done a family photo where the US delegation and the African leaders stood together. We could no longer do that. There were a whole bunch of other things that the CCA had to do. The \u201cInvesting in Zimbabwe\u201d breakfast couldn\u2019t happen any more. The President of Botswana at the time, Masisi , was actually very understanding about it, but we created a political headache for him. This is his neighbor. He doesn\u2019t have sanctions on Zimbabwe, and he\u2019s now having to figure out how the US delegation for the US-Africa Business Forum can be quarantined from the Zimbabwe leader. That just felt over the top. That\u2019s it. But this is a forum about increasing US trade investment in Africa. Let\u2019s not get twisted on what we\u2019re trying to do, which is invest in Africa. While there are sanctions on Zimbabwe , there are not sanctions on investing in Zimbabwe: it\u2019s with particular individuals and entities. For the sake of a photo op \u2014 at the minimum it was a distraction. President Biden and his African counterparts at the US-Africa Leaders Summit, December 2022 I don\u2019t know how far away \u2014 but I played the game a little bit too. We invited about 50 leaders on the continent. We didn\u2019t invite the President of Zimbabwe and Eritrea , because they\u2019re under sanctions. Usually the photo is organized by \u2014 alphabetical, reverse-alphabetical, protocol order \u2014 there\u2019s all these different ways, and it\u2019s a Rubik\u2019s cube. You\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t like the way that this looks, try a different one.\u201d Then we would try the different one. \u201cActually, the line of leaders on the second step is going to end here and we start the third step, so we\u2019re OK.\u201d I played into it too, but I keep thinking to myself, \u201cWhat was it all for?\u201d Was it as important as all of the stress that we had? That would be the argument: that by virtue of being next to the president, a leader is accruing some legitimacy. But you also have already invited that leader to Washington to attend a three-day summit hosted b"

    "keywords": "The likely next mayor of New York City is Zohran Mamdani, if polling is anywhere close to being correct. I\u2019ve been on a New York City kick recently on Statecraft (I live here), and have followed the race closely. Much of the conversation has revolved around the day-to-day administration of City Hall. If Mamdani wins, does he have what it takes to run the city\u2019s government? Today\u2019s guest is still active in NYC political life, and it was clear I would not get an answer to that particular question. 1 Instead, I took this opportunity to investigate how City Hall actually runs, and how the past three mayors have structured their administrations. But if you read between the lines, you can treat this conversation as a guide about what has worked in New York\u2019s governance over the last 20 years, and the likely stumbling blocks for an ambitious new administration. Maria Torres-Springer moved to New York City a week before 9/11, and spent most of the following 20 years in city government \u2014 first as a top appointee in the Bloomberg administration, then in several high-powered roles under Bill de Blasio, and eventually as second-in-command for Eric Adams. Her most recent role was as first deputy mayor : functionally the Chief Operating Officer of New York City. Torres-Springer resigned in February 2025 (she was not implicated in the overlapping Eric Adams corruption scandals). To put it lightly, Torres-Springer has fans. In November 2024, City & State New York wrote a cover story titled, \u201cThe Vibe at City Hall is Thank God for Maria Torres-Springer.\u201d It quotes political figures from the far left, center left, and right, calling Torres-Springer \u201ca phenomenal leader,\u201d \u201ca very classy, charismatic, knowledgeable individual,\u201d and, \u201ca serial overachiever in a good way.\u201d When Adams appointed her as first deputy mayor, he said, \u201cShe has the ability of landing the plane.\u201d Torres-Springer is widely described as one of the most effective political operators in New York City, and she\u2019s been linked in media stories as a potential official in the next mayoral administration (although she recently took a role as President of the Revson Foundation, a NYC-based philanthropic organization). She\u2019s maybe the best possible guest to talk about steering City Hall. Given constraints on what Torres-Springer could discuss, I wanted to get into two big topics. One is process . What does it take to run City Hall? How have different mayors done it differently? The other is outcomes . Torres-Springer was one of the champions of City of Yes , the Adams-backed initiative to build 500,000 new housing units in the city over the next 10 years. I wanted to better understand City of Yes, what she\u2019s most excited about, what didn\u2019t make the cut, and how it all came together politically. From City & State New York We discuss: What it takes to succeed working for three very different mayors How Bloomberg, de Blasio, and Adams governed differently How to work effectively under constant pressure The political coalitions that made City of Yes possible Why it takes over a year to turn over a NYCHA apartment How to fix the plumbing of government What the next mayor should prioritize to keep New York thriving Thanks to Harry Fletcher-Wood, Eamonn Ives, and Katerina Barton for their judicious audio and transcript edits for length and clarity. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Are there many people who have worked for at least three mayoralties? It\u2019s fairly atypical at the senior level to have worked for three consecutive mayors. But in the public-sector workforce \u2014 300,000 strong \u2014 there are many dedicated employees who have worked across different administrations. I feel very fortunate to have been able to work \u2014 at times of both growth and crisis \u2014 in three different administrations, each trying to move the city forward. They say it\u2019s the second-hardest job in the United States. You\u2019re not just managing that 300,000-person workforce; you\u2019re the CEO of a company that has 8.5 million shareholders, and they all voice very loudly how they feel about your performance. And you have a media environment where everything is under scrutiny, so it\u2019s not for the faint of heart. I started as a policy analyst in the Bloomberg administration and over the course of 20 years was able to work in three different agencies and at City Hall, until I was appointed first deputy mayor. The love all three mayors had for New York City, and their commitment to moving it forward, was irrefutable. But they all had different ideologies and styles of governing: Mike Bloomberg had a very purposeful governing and management philosophy. He hired well and delegated responsibility to agency heads and deputy mayors. For young staffers, that meant you saw some very good techniques for how to manage a sprawling bureaucracy. They say that New York is ungovernable, but that administration did as much as it could to bring order to what can often be a chaotic environment. The governing philosophy of Mayor Bill de Blasio I would describe as: he knew what his North Stars were. There were some very important initiatives and priorities \u2014 universal pre-kindergarten, his affordable housing plan. Because it was so clear what those priorities were, that allowed government to organize itself \u2014 [ which ] allowed for the quick and successful implementation of ambitious initiatives. Mayor Eric Adams prioritized being accessible to everyday New Yorkers and creating a porousness to ensure that the voices of those New Yorkers who may have been betrayed by the government, or didn\u2019t have access to it, were heard. That meant we had to be focused on constituent services and making sure that we were thinking about how government needed to work better for the greatest number of people. Torres-Springer with Mayor Eric Adams Despite three different mayors, there is a workforce within city government that is incredibly focused on not just responding to shifts in the political wind, but turning vision and mayoral agendas into very practical results for New Yorkers. I learned from each of the mayors. From the Bloomberg administration, the use of data \u2014 the importance of answering, \u201cWhat is the best solution to this problem?\u201d before you start trying to triangulate and solve for politics \u2014 was a very early and useful lesson. The need to build the right teams: one of the most important assets that any senior leader has in government is the team he or she is leading. If you create an environment where team members are empowered and trusted, where they can not just execute programs but also imagine how government can do its best work, then you create these \u201cride-or-die\u201d teams. I knew every day that my life depended on the strength of the teams that I was working with. Those were early lessons that I learned from Bloomberg: how to make sure you assemble, nurture, and empower the right people, with the right expertise, in the right formation, toward the right goals, at the right pace, to get done what needs to get done. When you hire for particular positions, it\u2019s important not just to ask: \u201cAre they qualified for the job?\u201d There are a number of people who have the right skill sets and background for a number of positions. But in government you\u2019re also solving for a couple of other questions. For example, \u201cWhy are they interested in this business?\u201d It can\u2019t just be because of a desire to give back. Those who I\u2019ve seen step up over time and be resilient are those who have a sense of personal mission and of what they uniquely can accomplish in government. Sometimes that\u2019s because they have a particular lived experience. In my case, I grew up with housing insecurity and I knew what it felt like for government to work or not work. We grew up with a Section 8 voucher and we depended on it. That translated to a career in public service where I never forgot what was at stake. This wasn\u2019t just about high-falutin policy, or jargon, or a bunch of policy wonks trying to find solutions. It was a matter of life or death for the people we were trying to serve. I do, but that\u2019s okay, especially for early-career professionals. You might not come in saying, \u201cI want to fix this crisis, and here\u2019s the long list, here\u2019s my autobiography, and why I\u2019m uniquely positioned.\u201d But I would test for a sincerity in why they want to be in government and an aptitude for solving problems in government. You get more responsibility as an early-career professional than you probably should. Those who take that responsibility seriously say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to squander this opportunity. I\u2019m going to be the type of professional who is curious and will stop at nothing to find the right set of solutions.\u201d Importantly \u2014 and this is prized in most work environments, but in particular in government \u2014 [ we need ] someone who works well in teams and is able to collaborate across different agencies, inside and outside of government, under extraordinary time constraints, and where a lot is on the line. Mayor Bloomberg in his City Hall open-plan office It was the first bullpen I ever knew. If it\u2019s any indicator, that setup still exists \u2014 persisting through the de Blasio and Adams administrations. Some of the conference rooms in the last two administrations were converted back into offices, but most of the City Hall staff still sit in the bullpen. It was novel at the time, maybe even radical, but it had benefits. Some are probably pretty obvious. New York City government is at a scale and pace that is unimaginable. On any given day, there are 12,000 tons of trash that have to get picked up, one billion gallons of water that need to be supplied, 30,000 acres of parkland to be maintained. Anything that you can do, office format included, to create a better velocity of communication and action is helpful. The other thing is transparency. You knew where everyone was. You could overhear who was having an argument and how issues were getting resolved \u2014 from the first deputy mayor to a policy analyst who just started the week before. In fact, when I was appointed as first deputy mayor, one of the things that I did was to create a rotating desk up in the bullpen, do various deputy mayors would spend time upstairs. This wasn\u2019t just symbolic; it was a way to show that we prioritize accountability and transparency. You create an environment that prizes execution and low drama versus palace intrigue. That\u2019s the type of culture that every mayor should strive to create. That\u2019s a good question. Probably those moments didn\u2019t happen often enough or at the length that is necessary to do that type of deep processing, but I was very intentional about creating spaces for that. There\u2019s a crush and heave to the work, and it\u2019s very easy for you to let the work happen to you. There\u2019s a crisis every day, there\u2019s a press story every minute, and meanwhile the deadlines continue. When I was appointed in the Adams administration as deputy mayor I brought back a practice that I saw in the Bloomberg and de Blasio administrations. I brought together all of the agency heads within my portfolio for a monthly lunch. That might sound very basic, but it was a rare opportunity for leaders to come together, and share not just the critical priorities of the month, but to hear from other leaders, tackle problems together, and syndicate their strategic plans. You have to be very intentional, especially at the beginning of an administration, because you are trying to do three things all at once \u2014 running a government, changing a government, and building a government. It was important to me to have a process in the beginning of agenda-setting. We have blueprints on housing , economic development , workforce development , and climate , that were established early on. This was an exercise, not just in creating glossy brochures that no one read, but in ensuring that we set some markers about what needed to happen with a particular policy domain or agency in order to not mistake activity in government \u2014 which is always quite feverish \u2014 for direction. A major one in housing, for instance, was a moonshot goal of 500,000 units of new homes over the next decade, backed up with very detailed plans about how we were going to get there. For economic development, it was not just regaining the one million jobs we lost during the pandemic, but also topping the total employment and private-sector employment records the city held before the pandemic. On workforce development, we had a goal of 30,000 apprenticeships, which was a new model for workforce training in New York. Each of these blueprints had a major overall goal and a number of intermediate key performance indicators that we wanted to track, in order to ensure we were making good progress, because the goals were meant to be moonshots. They weren\u2019t foolishly derived, but they were ambitious enough to galvanize and inspire public servants and partners outside of government to do more and better for New Yorkers. After three terms in the Bloomberg administration, we had new leaders, new energy, and new plans. The styles were different. For Mayor de Blasio, in order to make sure we had the right process for decision-making, [ we used what ] we called the decision memo matrix. We had to be very clear about what exactly we were trying to accomplish: what was the decision? Who had to sign off? What were the budget implications? Every mayor has his or her own way of making decisions, but in a new administration the principal has to set some guardrails for how he or she will decide on matters small, medium, and large. It was a process of getting acclimated to a new way of making decisions, a new set of priorities, and new people in these roles. It establishes \u2014 just because of what you had to write down \u2014 a framework for what\u2019s important, what needs to be addressed, and who needs to sign off before something is ready for a decision by the mayor. To the extent that there were informal ways that other administrations may have come to decisions, that type of process makes very clear the different components of a good decision. There are a couple of drawbacks. One is that our problems are so complicated and nuanced in New York, and there\u2019s something about putting it in a memo that almost flattens or simplifies it. It was important to supplement [ the memo ] with discussion in real time \u2014 with people looking at each other eye-to-eye, to contend with gnarly decisions you can\u2019t quite summarize in a particular memo. The other thing that every administration needs to think about is: \u201cDoes the process create structure, but also bottlenecks?\u201d If at the end of the day you were left with 200 decision memos \u2014 that had to be read, vetted, and resolved \u2014 but it slows down the process, there\u2019s room for tweaking and modification. [ The new mayor has ] to figure out what process they need to make the right decisions \u2014 and make sure that that process results in a quality and speed of decision-making that is commensurate with the complexity of the job. There are principles that I have observed and learned that if anyone asked me, \u201cWhat does it mean to govern? What does it mean to structure City Hall?\u201d I\u2019m a broken record about. Number one is to make sure that the system is simple and transparent. That starts with reducing bureaucratic friction by having an org chart people can understand and doesn\u2019t have too many silos or portfolios. Not because you think your senior leaders won\u2019t get along, but because it is just human nature that silos create competing priorities and personalities. Anything you can do to have the minimum number of direct reports to the mayor allows for the trade-offs and decision-making to happen more readily. Number two is focusing on communication, internally and externally. The major currency in a place like City Hall is information and access to the mayor. If you make those things scarce, then that results in confusion and game-playing that you don\u2019t want. Everyone is vying to get access. Everyone is trading on information \u2014 it\u2019s not that it\u2019s secret, it\u2019s just that a decision is made and it hasn\u2019t been communicated back to the teams. So that discipline of feedback loops, of communicating big policy decisions, certainly before they\u2019re in the press, matters. You\u2019ll be surprised how important that is to ensure that the staff at City Hall trust their leaders and therefore act in trustworthy ways. The third is anything you can do to minimize drama. The public servants I\u2019ve worked with all want to focus on the very hard work of government. The less intrigue, infighting, public spats, and scandal that they have to contend with on a daily basis, the more they are focused on the work. All the ways to create a low-drama culture where you show that what is prized is quiet execution, not intrigue, will go a very long way. Always operate honestly and transparently. I can\u2019t tell you how important having those North Stars was. In any administration there will be natural or manmade crises. We had this mantra in my team: \u201cWe have to walk a straight line through the initiatives that we set out \u2014 to combat the housing crisis, to bring back jobs \u2014 despite all of the distractions that will come our way.\u201d There was clarity about what the priorities were. There will always be a day where there is stuff in the news. It\u2019s human nature to pay attention for a second, but my team knew what their day jobs were. That type of clarity \u2014 those types of playbooks of what needed to get done \u2014 was important. Most important is doing everything that I could to model low-drama behavior. Everything within City Hall and government is contagious. You set the culture early on, and it spreads and embeds. As senior leaders, if you want a no-nonsense, low-drama \u2014 \u201cThis is a place of employment, we are here to make sure that tax dollars are spent wisely\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s what you model, then you have teams that do just that, even during times of crisis. \u2026Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll say. There are the words that people use and then there\u2019s the business of government. The private sector is obviously not monolithic. There are major corporations which employ many New Yorkers, small businesses where a lot of job growth happens, and all the types of firms in between \u2014 architects, builders, and other professionals. Everything I did \u2014 in Small Business Services , at the Economic Development Corporation (EDC), or in housing \u2014 doesn\u2019t happen just because of government alone. Every unit of housing that was built was built because it was a partnership between public and private. In the EDC, when we were growing industries \u2014 from life sciences to fashion \u2014 that involved private-sector partnership as well. In the Department of Small Business Services, the programs that we ran were all about: \u201cWhat does it mean to help our mom-and-pop businesses and higher-growth companies hire more people, and have a better experience dealing with government?\u201d For too many of them, it was Kafkaesque. What I relied on in each of these roles under the three mayors was thinking, \u201cHow do you use the superpowers of that agency to help New Yorkers who are running a business or employed by a small business?\u201d That kept me and the teams focused on the mission, versus the back-and-forth in the media more generically about the business community. I am very proud of the work that we did through City of Yes. It was three different citywide text amendments [ to the zoning code ]. One focused on our goals in carbon neutrality , the second on economic development , and the third \u2014 the one that garnered the most headlines and was most difficult politically \u2014 was the City of Yes for Housing Opportunity . It is the most pro-housing set of zoning reforms the city has ever seen. It enables a little bit more housing in every neighborhood of New York, by clearing out a lot of the barnacles in our zoning code and relaxing certain requirements. There are close to 60 community districts in New Yo"

Specifically, the fund aims to help government: Attract and retain the right people Task them with the right work Via purpose-fit systems And test-and-learn frameworks Some of this may sound familiar, and of course it is: Jen\u2019s been on Statecraft more than any other guest, and her book Recoding America has been hugely influential for my generation of policy thinkers. In particular, Jen helped me get my head around an idea I\u2019ve been writing about over the past three years: if you want federal bureaucrats to act less like federal bureaucrats, get rid of the rules that require them to act like federal bureaucrats. Most of our frustrations with government inefficiency and ineffectiveness come from rules that constrain people working in those systems. Reform efforts that just focus on headcount or on further constraining the government may be good or bad ideas on their own merits, but they won\u2019t make the government more efficient, because bloated headcount is not why the government is inefficient in the first place. I\u2019ll be serving on the RAF board. Jen\u2019s assembled a really special team from both sides of the aisle. Especially exciting to readers of this newsletter will be Anne Healy, the new CEO, who served as Dean Karlan\u2019s #2 when he was chief economist of USAID. We talked to Dean on Statecraft , and you can get a sense of the lens his team brought to policy impact here: We\u2019ve covered the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, pretty consistently on Statecraft, since our first interview on PEPFAR, the flagship anti-AIDS program, in 2023. When DOGE came to USAID, I was extremely critical of the cuts to lifesaving aid, and the abrupt, pointlessly harmful ways in which they were enacted. In March, I 2. Reflections on the Progress Conference This is my second time attending the Progress Conference (and its second year running). Suffice to say, I have strong preferences about how conferences should be structured and run, and each year I\u2019ve attended this conference, I\u2019ve been wowed (and both times I\u2019ve learned new tricks for hosting vibrant intellectual events). Brilliant people, excellent venue, the right balance of structure and serendipity, high production value. Get your tickets early for next year. A couple of friends wrote up their thoughts on the conference, including Quade MacDonald , Corin Wagen , Shreeda Segan , and Simon Grimm , and I\u2019m sure there will be more write-ups elsewhere. Some discrete takeaways for me: Last year, I thought global fertility was a strangely overlooked topic at the conference. This year, there were several scheduled conversations on the topic, and far more interest. On the flip side, this year\u2019s edition was missing a battle royale between Tyler Cowen and the Lighthaven rationalists on whether AI doom can be modeled economically. Jan Sramek of California Forever presented a very compelling case that the new city they are building northeast of San Francisco has legs: both that they will be able to build it, and that it can be viable in the long term as a midsize urban agglomeration. Marc Dunkelman presented a very interesting case study on why *picking* bad infrastructure projects may be as big a problem as spending too much on the projects we do pick. I\u2019m not sure if it fully convinced me, but it was a new lens on an old problem. IFP co-founder Caleb Watney analyzed the American scientific portfolio, sliced along several axes. One stark conclusion: we may be overweighting project-based grants, relative to all the other ways one can fund science. chart courtesy of my colleague Nick Ritter There was more conversation about industrial production than expected. Dan Wang and Brian Potter have successfully convinced this corner of the intellectual world that physically generating things is important. Speaking of physically generated things, Works in Progress previewed their print edition, and it looks both beautiful and readable (sometimes, fancy new print editions of things only go 1 for 2). Following a productive dialogue , I resolve to dunk less on Europe and its anemic economic growth. Specifically, Simon Grimm convinced me that while the EU itself is as bad as Americans perceive, there are all kinds of useful state capacity lessons from individual European countries. I must paint with a finer brush. 13 years ago, Ben Thomas and I spent a summer together scrubbing toilets and operating industrial dishwashers at a summer camp in Ligonier, Pennsylvania. Although the conference was made possible by many hands, Ben was the most hands-on organizer. Operational excellence is operational excellence. I asked OSTP Director Michael Kratsios if the US government has secret stargate technology, and he did not say no. This episode was originally recorded on October 18th at the Progress Conference in Berkeley. Because of the federal shutdown, Director Kratsios called in virtually. Kratsios is Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , and the president\u2019s top science and technology advisor. In the first Trump administration, Kratsios was US Chief Technology Officer, and later acting Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, where he championed emerging tech like AI, quantum, and autonomous systems in defense. Given constraints in the topics Kratsios could speak on, my questions focused on understanding the administration\u2019s AI and science policy. We talked about the recent AI Action Plan : what AI can do for America and the world, and how the administration plans to ensure US leadership. We discuss the administration\u2019s vision for gold standard science, and whether the structures we use to fund science need to change. We also touched on how the second Trump administration differs from the first, and Kratsios\u2019s take on AI safety. Thanks to Harry Fletcher-Wood and Katerina Barton for their light edits for length and clarity in the transcript and audio, respectively, and for a tight turnaround. The White House has not yet cleared the full video for publication, but we\u2019ll share it here if it is cleared. I will tell you that was one of the most exciting speeches that I think we gave this term. It really set the foundation for where we want to go as a country on technology policy more broadly. The main thrust of the speech was around technological stagnation. To me, it\u2019s an absolute tragedy, the extent to which progress in the world of atoms has slowed down over the last few decades. Part of the way that we\u2019re going to get out of [ this stagnation ] is the agenda that the president is laying out, and the important role that the federal government can play in driving broader scientific and technological discovery. To me, one of the biggest reasons why we as a country will succeed is because of the innovation that we can have in science and technology. There\u2019s a very deep and rich history of the federal government in the United States being part of a larger innovation ecosystem. The challenge that we have faced over the years \u2014 and one thing that we think a lot about at this office \u2014 is the changing nature of where early-stage, basic pre-competitive research and development happens. If you go back to the era post-World War II, the vast majority of R&D was being funded by the federal government. Over the last 70 years, we\u2019ve had this inversion where now the majority of R&D is funded in the private sector. We have to ask ourselves every day: what role does the federal government play in a world where the private sector is investing more than any time in history in this research and development? The biggest example, the one that\u2019s screaming in our face every day, is with AI. You look at these numbers, the types of investment that are happening in infrastructure and R&D that\u2019s supporting the AI revolution. Even for many of us that are deeply immersed in tech, and have been for decades, these numbers are crazy. They are truly unbelievable levels of investment and it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s stopping. Every week there\u2019s a new big one. Policymakers like us here in Washington have to sit back and say: \u201cThere are billions, if not trillions of dollars being invested by the private sector in AI, but what role can the federal government play?\u201d That\u2019s the same type of question we ask for any of these emerging technologies. Going back to the speech, the point was that there always will be a very important role to play. The government has to make that choice to say: \u201cWe do not accept that stagnation. We want to work hand in glove with the private sector to make it happen. There are levers that we control which can make a big difference.\u201d It all began on the third day of the administration where President Trump, signed an executive order revoking the disastrous Biden executive order on AI , and essentially gave us a 180-day shot clock where myself, Secretary Rubio , and David Sacks were on the hook for delivering the national strategy for the US, called the action plan. We delivered it in July. That was launched at an event here in Washington. At the same event, the president signed three executive orders [ on permitting data centers , preventing woke AI , and promoting the export of American AI ] that generally mapped to some of the priorities in the plan. But the vision essentially laid out in the plan has three core policy thrusts, or main pillars: The first is the US has to continue to out-innovate and continue to be the leader in AI innovation. There\u2019s lots of work in there around regulatory issues, around R&D, and we can get into those. The second is the US has to lead on AI infrastructure. This revolution is going to be powered by electricity and by data centers, and we have to have those built in the United States as quickly as humanly possible. There\u2019s a lot we can do to accelerate that process and get the government out of the way as we build that infrastructure. The third is the importance of exporting American AI \u2014 essentially creating an ecosystem globally that is reliant on American technology. Lots of projects are being launched on that front as well. Thematically, that\u2019s the core themes of the action plan. There are almost 100 actions enumerated in it, but they generally fall into those three buckets. [ For more on the detail of the action plan, Statecraft recently interviewed its lead author, Dean Ball . ] Are these two things in tension? Do we want every country to have full AI sovereignty? Do we want the US tech stack to dominate in certain areas? How do you think about balancing those two priorities? I think of them in concert, not in opposition. For us, the core challenge we\u2019re facing \u2014 maybe if we zoom out and think a little about how we got to that third pillar, it came out of a lot of work that we did in Trump 45 around telecom. If you think of that era, the first big rollouts of 5G happened at the tail end of Trump 45. We, as a country, found out pretty quickly we were in a tough spot. We had no American manufacturer of advanced telecom kit. There were two allied partners, it was Nokia and Ericsson that could provide those. Then you had an upstart which was pretty good, which was Huawei . In the early days of that challenge, one could argue that the Huawei technology certainly was inferior to the US technology, but nonetheless, because of the heavy subsidy by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), they were able to aggressively go out and get their kit all over the Global South and even deep into the networks of some of our partners and allies. Me, as the CTO of the United States and kind of our tech minister, was left running around the world talking to my counterparts, trying to convince them to either rip and replace their Huawei or make the expensive decision to buy Ericsson or Nokia. There were a couple of lessons that I learned out of that. The first was that just because you have the very best technology doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be adopted. Price does matter, and the buyers are ultimately going to be quite price-sensitive, especially if at the end of the day you can get pretty much the same service by someone else. That created a very interesting national security problem for the US, where a lot of these networks could potentially be compromised and could have back doors, back to the PRC. If you fast forward to where we are today, one could argue that the export of American AI is arguably even more important than telecom, in the sense that the models of choice, and the stacks that are used around the world, are going to be critically important in the way that lots of governments and economies function. The ultimate software that is used to power healthcare services, to run tax services, to essentially be the platform in which all governments run all their AI services is really, really important. You want to be in a position where American models are ultimately the ones that are fine-tuned to run all these applications. Now the advantage we have, and what\u2019s different than before, is that we actually do have the very best technology. I think China at the moment is actually quite constrained in their ability to fabricate enough chips for export. The ones that they do fabricate domestically, there\u2019s more than enough demand internally. There just isn\u2019t enough excess to export. So we have this window of time \u2014 in the next year or two \u2014 where we truly can be the single powerful supplier of the totality of the stack, meaning chips, models and applications. The other advantage we hadn\u2019t before is we \u2014 America, our companies \u2014 are leading in all three layers. We have the very best chips in the world, the very best LLMs, and the very best applications on top of it. The thesis of the program is: let\u2019s try to bring all those together, make turnkey solutions that countries around the world can easily adopt and implement, and do that as quickly as possible, so that we can start creating these networks and ecosystems where developers, countries, and governments around the world are all using American technology. The president signed the executive order in July of this year. There\u2019s a shot clock at the Department of Commerce to stand up the program in the next week or two. You\u2019ll see some announcements out of Commerce coming soon. Then the ball is ultimately handed to a committee [ the Economic Diplomacy Action Group ] that\u2019s led by the Secretary of State, that includes the Secretary of Commerce, me and a few others, to go out and do the export early next year. We want the world to know that America is open for business. We want the world to be running on our technology stack, which we think is the best \u2014 and we want to go out in the world and tell them that. I was at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Digital Ministerial in Korea a few months ago where we shared this message and we essentially said that, \u201cThe US is open for business. We do want to sell you chips, and we deeply believe that the ideals and the priorities that you have as countries ultimately are ones that are aligned with the US.\u201d It goes back a little bit to the sovereignty question \u2014 I didn\u2019t quite answer it, but to answer it: the reality is we have a stack which can answer the mail to the priorities of individual countries. If you\u2019re a country and you have sensitive government data, you obviously don\u2019t want to be running an AI system where there\u2019s an API call to a foreign country, even if it is the United States. We understand that, and the hope is that we can design a system, with the great technology companies we have today, which can allow them to operate American software in a way that ultimately is able to meet whatever standards they have in-country. Tell me how you\u2019re thinking about the protect side of things. In the last couple of weeks, the Secret Service uncovered this massive telecoms hacking network in New York City. Earlier this week, a former National Security Council staffer in the George W. Bush administration was arrested after the FBI raided his home and found thousands of top-secret Air Force documents that he\u2019d been passing along. This week, the British government admitted Chinese hackers have been inside the UK\u2019s classified network for over a decade. It\u2019s a little bit of what you said, and it\u2019s a lot about the world of exports and constraints for some of our adversaries from accessing our highest-end technology. On one hand, there\u2019s an incredible amount that we need to do to secure our critical infrastructure. We have a new National Cyber Director here at the White House that\u2019s very focused on that, along with the folks at the Department of Homeland Security , and we need to be very vigilant in tracking the type of hacking that ultimately happens by a lot of our adversaries. We see it all the time, and it\u2019s disheartening, but we\u2019ve got to do better. On the more \u201cprotect\u201d side of technology, a policy that we\u2019ve maintained and kept in place is \u2014 particularly in the world of AI \u2014 our most high-end chips are ones that we are limiting the ability for adversaries to have access to. That\u2019s something that had started as early as the [ first ] Trump administration where we put export controls on some of our advanced lithography equipment, which ultimately has paid big dividends in limiting the ability of the PRC to develop high-end chips. That will continue. Finding that balance of needing to promote as much as possible \u2014 get American tech out there \u2014 and also rate-limit our adversary on the very high-end stuff is the general strategy. Our second pillar of the strategy is, how do we accelerate our ability to build both the data centers and the power capacity? It\u2019s a very tricky and interesting problem. There is one part that\u2019s federal-government-related, and there is certainly National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)-related things you have to get through and other types of federal permitting. [Statecraft previously discussed the impact of NEPA . ] That\u2019s the stuff that we as a government have a lot of control of. The president directed in his executive order on AI infrastructure that we need to, as quickly as possible, accelerate that effort to remove those barriers and make it much easier to get your adjudication done on approval or not for your projects. That\u2019s an ongoing effort, and we want to make it as easy as possible, essentially a one-stop shop to come to the government and say, \u201cLook, I want to build this AI infrastructure, help me get all the necessary permits and approvals,\u201d and we can help you do that. That\u2019s in the works. The second piece, which is a little trickier, is state and local. If you talk to a lot of people who are building data centers and trying to do the energy build-out, a lot of the bottlenecks end up at the state and local level. We\u2019re trying our best to liaise with a lot of state governments to try to make it clear that this is a priority for their country. They as a state can benefit if these build-outs ultimately happen. The third piece around that \u2014 of things that the federal government controls \u2014 is we have our own real estate. We have federal lands, which can be used for build-outs themselves. Many of you may have been tracking the Department of Energy program. The Department of Energy has already announced four locations for build-outs of data centers. That\u2019s already underway. We did that in the first six months of the admin. But as I understand, you have a fairly small team compared to other parts of the executive branch. In his interview with Statecraft"

Last week \u2014 despite the shutdown \u2014 it cleared the Senate. It\u2019s a package of 27 pieces of legislation to boost housing supply, improve affordability, reduce regulatory roadblocks, and reduce homelessness. When you zoom out a bit, what\u2019s happened here is pretty surprising. The chair of the committee, Republican Tim Scott, and the Ranking Member, Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, co-sponsored the bill. The bill is the committee\u2019s first bipartisan housing markup in over a decade. Passing through committee unanimously doesn\u2019t happen often for serious bills of this sort. I wanted to understand how this bill happened, and came to have a serious shot at passing. And I also wanted to get a better sense of what\u2019s actually in the bill, and why it matters for housing. If you\u2019re like me, most of the debates you hear about housing policy focus on zoning, which is a local issue \u2014 very little federal say. So what are all these pieces of legislation? Do they matter? Joining me is an unorthodox trio: Will Poff-Webster was legislative counsel for Senator Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii. He\u2019s our inside guy today: he worked on the bill within the Senate. Now, he covers housing policy at IFP! Alex Armlovich is Senior Housing Policy Analyst at the Niskanen Center . He has been working on housing issues for a long time, and his fingerprints are on parts of this bill package. He\u2019s my advocate from the outside. Brian Potter is Senior Infrastructure Fellow at IFP and author of Construction Physics , which I very much enjoy editing. If I can make one newsletter recommendation to you besides Statecraft , it\u2019s Construction Physics . He has a background in private-sector home building. And has written about several of the proposals in this package. What\u2019s the federal role in housing policy?

Subscribe For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: It\u2019s one of these classic, vaguely ridiculous congressional acronyms. I\u2019ve heard that LLMs have made it way easier to come up with funny acronyms for bills. Is that true? Will Poff-Webster: It\u2019s something that people on the Hill spend time thinking about: how do you develop a catchy acronym for your bill? There have always been some staffers who have a knack for it and others who delegate to them. The LLMs definitely have that knack too. Eight out of ten of their suggestions are bad, but because two out of ten are good, it is not an uncommon way to get a bill title. One of the funny parts is, you\u2019ll see more bills now where the title is catchy and alliterative, but it\u2019s totally unrelated to the bill subject. You\u2019ll see a title that makes you think it\u2019s about ocean science and then it\u2019s a housing bill. But it\u2019s one of the ways that AI maybe has some positive productivity benefits. But there\u2019s still people coming up with the acronyms the analog way, I promise. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said that President Trump may declare a national housing emergency. Listeners who live in big, expensive cities \u2014 I\u2019m in New York, we have listeners in LA \u2014 will have a visceral sense of this. But why should I think the cost of housing is a national issue? Why is it not just an issue in New York, San Francisco, and a grab bag of big cities? Brian Potter: There\u2019s a couple of reasons. One is that these big, expensive metro areas are huge drivers of economic growth. If you can get more people living in these places, contributing more, and growing GDP, that helps the country as a whole. The other thing is that a lot of cities are now following the path of these big metros. I live in Atlanta, which historically was a place where housing prices were relatively inexpensive. But over the last several years, they\u2019ve ramped up. You see that in a lot of metros across the country. This problem, that was once concentrated in these expensive coastal cities, is becoming more universal. Will: COVID has an interesting influence here. If you look at the data from Up for Growth , one of the premier national housing organizations that studies this, you see a change over the last few years. There were already trends leading to more places suffering from severe housing shortage. But [ after COVID ] you have more people moving out of places like California into places like Montana. If you talk to legislators in Montana who did their zoning reform work , a few thousand additional Californians had a big impact on their housing stock. If you have a place that isn\u2019t growing very much, and then suddenly gets an influx of work-from-home folks or folks who are leaving the city, that matters. What used to be a regional problem has become a national problem. The latest report from Up for Growth shows that most metropolitan areas in the United States now have a housing shortage. Alex Armlovich: It is a national problem that you see spreading: wherever people want to live, and there\u2019s bad zoning, you have a problem. Montana had maybe a 7% vacancy rate before the pandemic. Their housing stock is smaller than Queens in New York City. 50,000 Californians is enough to drive Montana\u2019s vacancy rate to zero. Pretty soon you have to have a construction response to that. That said, I still like to take an urban-economic -disciplined look at this. A housing affordability problem is the combination of two problems: incomes and high housing costs. You can have a place that has very low incomes and high housing cost burdens, but houses are not sold for more than it costs to build a structure. YIMBYism and zoning reform can\u2019t solve a problem where houses are selling and renting at their construction cost. That\u2019s a problem of people having low incomes and not being able to afford construction costs. The wedge between costs and sale prices tells you where land-use regulations are doing the most damage. Places with high wages and high amenities \u2014 including good weather, jobs, and infrastructure \u2014 are where demand collides with bad land-use regulation. It\u2019s an increasingly nationalized problem, and you look at that wedge to identify the spots. Will: In these high-cost places, we are seeing an inability to build because land-use regulations are too strict to allow housing to expand at the rate you would need to accommodate the number of people who want to live there. There\u2019s this book by Yoni Appelbaum called Stuck about a change in American life. We used to have a society where people would move all the time. They\u2019d move to new places; they\u2019d move within their neighborhood to a nicer house. We\u2019ve become a society where, instead of moving to places of greater opportunity, people move to places of lower cost of living. The trends that led people to move from Mississippi to New York have now reversed. A janitor can make more money, relative to their cost of living, if they live in a low-cost place. We have turned an engine of opportunity into an engine of disaggregation of poverty. People have to move to poorer places to make ends meet. They are no longer able to access that opportunity because of the land-use regulations and zoning controls in the high-cost, high-opportunity places. Alex: You ask, \u201cWhy are substance-use disorder and severe mental illness important drivers of a core of difficult-to-treat homelessness?\u201d Think of New York or San Francisco. If your cousin develops a mood disorder in their twenties, as so often happens, and loses their job and needs a spot to stay, middle-class people in New York \u2014 sometimes they don\u2019t even have a spare couch, let alone a spare bedroom, or an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU): a garage or a basement that could be inhabited sustainably. Family networks are an important buffer. In Baltimore you can do that. In even high-income places, it\u2019s not possible. Will: We talk about a \u201chousing crisis,\u201d but there are two parts to it . There\u2019s an affordability crisis \u2014 people can\u2019t afford a home \u2014 and there\u2019s a housing shortage. In some parts of the country, and for some people, particularly the lowest-income Americans, they\u2019re never going to be able to afford a home without some assistance. They\u2019re going to need a Section 8 voucher or another support. But in the highest-cost parts, and in a growing part of America, you need a voucher even at a middle-income level \u2014 100% of the area median income or above \u2014 to afford a home. In places where our land use creates a massive shortage of housing, it becomes a problem for everyone. Even a middle-income person needs housing assistance. There isn\u2019t enough assistance for all the low-income people who might be able to afford a market-rate house in a place like Minneapolis. If they live in New York, San Francisco, or Honolulu, they\u2019re not going to be able to make it work without significant subsidy. Unfortunately that subsidy isn\u2019t available. Will: Minneapolis and Austin, Texas are two of the big standouts. Both places have a lot of people moving there. They have growing industry and job bases, but they also have recognized that they need to build more housing in order to keep it affordable for the people who live there and who want to move there. In Minneapolis, there\u2019s affordability at the 60% area median income-level, which is significantly below average for a market-rate house. If you go to a place like Boston, New York, DC, there\u2019s these big fights over, \u201cWe need more deed-restricted affordable units,\u201d \u201cWe need the government to require affordable units.\u201d That\u2019s all well and good, but Minneapolis is doing it in the private market. That\u2019s been a wake-up call to people on the left that there\u2019s a big role for exclusionary zoning in causing this problem. Places like Minneapolis that have reckoned with a past of exclusionary zoning and reformed it are seeing the benefits. Alex: The case for the states is strong. I have a variant of this idea from Catholic social thought called subsidiarity : the idea that decision-making should be at the lowest level of government... Alex: These governance questions didn\u2019t become a problem yesterday. The idea is you move a decision down to the lowest level at which it can reasonably be made. I like to add a little economist twist to that, which is, you bring it to the lowest level that internalizes most of the costs and benefits of the decision. Local governments that are small, relative to their labor market area, will tend not to internalize the consequences of growth and transportation-planning decisions that affect the entire region. If you are small, you could say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to lock down growth here and our residents will just get jobs somewhere else. Why do we have to grow? Why doesn\u2019t the other city grow?\u201d You end up with this collective action problem at the regional level. The right level for most decision-making that affects metropolitan areas is a partnership between state and local \u2014 state guardrails make sure regional interests are taken into account when local governments make transport and growth-control decisions that affect the region. Will: To put a political lens on this, I used to work for a city councilor. It\u2019s very hard for a councilor to come out in favor of new housing, because the voter participation rates in local elections are 5-10%. The people who show up are the people who don\u2019t want something to change. There\u2019s good research on this from Katherine Levine Einstein and others, that the majority of people are in favor of new housing, but the people who show up to a community meeting about it are vastly less likely to be in favor. They are more likely to be elderly homeowners who have professional degrees, as compared to the general population. If you\u2019re a city councilor, what you\u2019re hearing all the time is people thinking about the cost of growth \u2014 who don\u2019t want their neighborhood to change. That\u2019s not what happens if you\u2019re a governor. It\u2019s hard to find a Not In My Backyard (NIMBY) governor. They recognize their states need to grow \u2014 or need to not be hemorrhaging population like a lot of big blue states are now. At state and federal levels, people are seeing the benefits. You have elected officials with a broad enough purview \u2014 looking at their whole state or nation \u2014 and seeing we have a problem with housing being expensive, and with a shortage of this good that we all say we want, but we make hard to get through regulation. At the local level, often realtors\u2019 associations will be opposed to new housing because they\u2019ll be invested in the homeowner experience. But at the state and federal level, realtors recognize the benefits of home building. Same thing with unions: they want more work and more members. They care about growth and construction. But the more local you get, the more people see the costs and not the benefits. That\u2019s part of what Alex is talking about here, and why it makes sense to do some of the stuff at higher levels. I also think it\u2019s hard to find a NIMBY federal elected official. Most of them hear what is going on here. There was an important hearing that the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee had, where they listened to economists and heard about this problem spreading around the country \u2014 that changed some minds. They don\u2019t have in their ear the most cantankerous person on the block who doesn\u2019t want anything to change. They\u2019re thinking about a broader set of people. Alex: It\u2019s not, \u201cBecause of the tactics, I want to go where it\u2019s easier.\u201d Local governments are not structured properly. It would be hard to imagine that local governments that are small, relative to their labor market, could possibly get the answer correct. Will: In terms of, \u201cWhy should the federal government be involved?\u201d this issue is growing in importance for Americans. It\u2019s now something people hear about in town halls. Cost of living is the top issue for voters. Historically, when issues get more important, the federal government gets more involved. That doesn\u2019t have to mean overriding state or local governments. It means instead trying to provide the tools, supports, and nudges needed to get this issue taken more seriously. Brian: Historically you have seen the federal government achieving state and local change by virtue of how they direct funding. A big mechanism they\u2019ve used is, \u201cIf you do not do this thing that we want, we are going to restrict you from getting federal highway funding,\u201d which has been very important for them to build new highways. A lot of this bill does change how federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) money is granted. There\u2019s precedent for these sorts of things being successful. Will: The federal government also has a fair amount of expertise in what works. It was Herbert Hoover , as Commerce Secretary, who pushed the first model zoning codes that were adopted by state and local governments. That\u2019s how we got from a place where homelessness was not a housing problem to now \u2014 in a history that has a lot of racism and income discrimination to it, trying to not have the wrong people live in your neighborhood. What the federal government is trying to do in this bill is a range of small-to-medium-sized interventions that redirect its fiscal power in the direction of greater housing supply, greater construction, and reforming state and local zoning. Also in terms of expertise, telling state and local governments, \u201cWe\u2019re here to help. If you want to reform your zoning, here\u2019s a model zoning code that \u2014 instead of being exclusionary, excessively restrictive, and limiting property rights \u2014 helps a local builder, or a community member who wants to rebuild their house and add a granny flat .\u201d I don\u2019t want to forget the program reform part as well. There\u2019s an overhang of improvements that could happen to federal housing programs that have not been authorized or edited in a very long time. There are statutory provisions from a long time ago that people have great ideas for how to fix. There\u2019s great stuff in this bill on disaster recovery, rural housing, homelessness funding \u2014 all sorts of areas. Alex: I like to bucket it into technical assistance plus incentives, and funding and financing reform. Alex: That means instructing HUD to help state and local governments figure stuff out at an operational level. It\u2019s not forcing them to do anything and it\u2019s not changing their incentives. It\u2019s just helping them understand a topic. Alex: The Housing Supply Frameworks Act sub-component of the bill is the marquee technical-assistance one, because it\u2019s convening a national commission to \u2014 for the first time since Herbert Hoover \u2014 rewrite federal model codes for state and local governments. That would guide HUD staff in the future when they\u2019re applying incentives \u2014 they can check, \u201cWhat does it mean to be pro-housing? There\u2019s a list that we publish.\u201d Parts of HUD are not full of land-use experts, so they themselves might need some technical assistance. It\u2019s also for helping state and local governments understand good law rather than bad. Over 100 years ago, when Herbert Hoover, future president, was Secretary of Commerce, the Department of Commerce published these model codes. When you say you want to update those, is there a model code now, from 100 years ago, that states and localities look at to understand what the feds think they should do on housing? Alex: It will shock you, Santi, to see how many states are still using Herbert Hoover\u2019s State Zoning Enabling Act . They had 19 states using it within just a couple years of the model code passing. There\u2019s dozens still using it today. What\u2019s in there? Why does that code need reforming? Alex: To our earlier discussion about where these powers lie: zoning is not a local power. It is a state power that is delegated at the pleasure of the legislature and governor. Before 1916, localities not only had no zoning, they could not zone. I like to chuckle when we talk about federal sovereign immunity with respect to post offices. It\u2019s not explicit in the Constitution because the Founding Fathers did not foresee that local governments could control the building of things like post offices. All of our great cities were built without the ability to regulate growth in this manner. That\u2019s why [ the model code ] is still there. It is the details of how to grant state power to localities, and the manners in which they may exercise it. Question two: What\u2019s in this big package that got through committee 24-0? It\u2019s spending more money. You\u2019d expect some fights. Will: Maybe it\u2019s helpful to talk through a couple of examples. One is the Build Now Act . It takes a large federal pot of money: the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) \u2014 that\u2019s over $3 billion dollars distributed every year to local grantees. It says, \u201cIf you\u2019re an expensive jurisdiction, we\u2019re going to compare how much housing you\u2019re building to other expensive cities. If you build more than average, you\u2019re going to get a bonus from CDBG dollars. If you build less than average, you\u2019re going to get a cut, and the money will be distributed to places that are doing the right thing.\u201d It\u2019s not all their grant \u2014 it\u2019s only 10% \u2014 but it is significant. That money is flexible: a jurisdiction can spend it on infrastructure to support new housing, or on the cost of services, to help accommodate the growth we need in high-cost urban areas. What I like about the focus on the high-cost places is, if you\u2019re in a high-cost place where people want to move, your problem is zoning. You\u2019re not building enough housing to "

A burning question motivates his work: How do you make cities places where families can live and thrive? He has a new report out with the Institute of Family Studies looking at what families really want from their apartments. This is a pretty self-indulgent episode for me. I live in Brooklyn with my wife and two-year-old, and we\u2019re expecting our second kid. We want to stay in the city \u2014 it\u2019s where our life and community are, and where we\u2019ve put down roots. But the classic route for people like us is to move out to the suburbs once the family grows. I hoped talking to Bobby would help me avoid that fate. Bobby argues that the best ideas for family-friendly housing aren\u2019t new. Pre-war apartments in American cities look a lot like what he\u2019s advocating for. We\u2019ve done this before, and we could do it again. How the financial crisis fuelled a boom in studio apartments Why did apartments get so much smaller after 2008? Why are most two-bedroom apartments designed for roommates? What do families actually want in a floor plan, and why don\u2019t developers build it? Whether upzoning can help Thanks to Harry Fletcher-Wood and Katerina Barton for their judicious transcript and audio edits. Subscribe For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Not only are apartments a greater share of housing relative to generations past, but this is concentrated in areas where apartments were already being built \u2014 cities and the areas directly around them. An apartment is only going to go in an area where land values are slightly higher. A single-family house is more likely to go in greenfield development. I was not involved professionally in real estate prior to the Great Recession. But afterwards \u2014 in 2009\u201311 \u2014 if you had a project called a \u201ccondo project,\u201d the barriers placed on you by lenders were very high. They required things like pre-sales of units in order to make the loan. Whereas for an \u201capartment project\u201d \u2014 the same building, volume, and space \u2014 they were going to allow that to just go forward. This is something that doesn\u2019t get telegraphed enough to intelligent laymen: how much the policies of the agency lenders \u2014 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , in particular \u2014 drove development and rehabilitation of apartment stock. Like a lot of government programs, it turns out that there are corner solutions . Apartments ended up being one of those corner solutions. Then smaller and smaller apartments, or apartments that had a greater share of one bedrooms and roommate-oriented two bedrooms, started being built in significantly greater numbers, accelerating from 2009 until today. There was so much inventory that had been built for sale, slowly working its way through the market. That same time period is when the private equity firms started entering in a big way, buying single-family rentals. That hadn\u2019t existed before, but there was a huge amount of stock that ended up getting purchased by Invitation Homes and other firms. It was difficult to justify how you could make the numbers work to build when the market was so saturated. What\u2019s going on? The share of apartments that are studios is dramatically increasing. There are more people moving to the cities and to slightly denser areas. People would rather live on their own than with roommates. Before 2000, if you look at Austin, studios weren\u2019t built that much. Now, as high as 20\u201330% of new products are studios. So the greater share of the overall mix being 400, 500-square-foot units drives the average down quite a bit. That\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t think gets picked up enough in housing statistics. People look at raw numbers, rather than at \u201ctypology.\u201d The average unit size is shrinking anyway. It becomes easier to understand when you say, \u201cWe didn\u2019t build studios, and now we build tons of studios.\u201d I would encourage everyone to look at the floor plans, and it\u2019ll become abundantly clear. If you were to look at a typical two-bedroom apartment in D.C., Philadelphia, Boston \u2014 even Austin, Dallas \u2014 it will look the same in most of those markets. It has two equal-sized bedrooms with direct access to a bathroom and large closets. That\u2019s an ideal layout when what you\u2019re trying to solve for is maximizing rent, based on studios. Let\u2019s say the studio rent is going to be $1,000. To share a bedroom, it\u2019s going to be slightly cheaper than that \u2014 80\u201390%. That still puts two-bedroom rents at a fairly good number based on the overall size. There was no poor intent on anyone, but the main reason they\u2019re not designed for families is that they were designed for roommates. Since the Great Recession, many more young people have moved into the cities. The market is reacting to the fact that people want new apartments and they want to share. That is one of the things the IFS study looked at. We showed survey respondents a two-bedroom that had two equal-sized bedrooms, and then one that had a larger bedroom for parents and two smaller rooms, one that had a window and one that did not. Families, or people who were open to having children, had a dramatic preference for the same square footage with the extra room. That\u2019s the general principle of what it would look like: more open space, smaller secondary bedrooms. The other key point, within a fixed square footage, is fewer bathrooms than bedrooms. Through the \u201870s and \u201880s, two-bed, one-baths were a fairly commonplace unit type. Since the \u201890s, and particularly the 2000s, two-bedroom, one-baths are not built. It\u2019s all two-bedroom, two-bath. Not only have apartment sizes shrunk, but the ratio of bedrooms to bathrooms has also shrunk. The excess living space has also decreased, because bathrooms are regulated by turn radius and other fixed things, more than other rooms. You can\u2019t get them much smaller than 5x8 feet, especially if they have a shower or a tub. That usable square footage shrinks even more. The turn radius is specifically designed for a wheelchair. Whether or not the unit is fully-compliant with a wheelchair, one of the bathrooms needs to be partially available for wheelchair users. It means that bathrooms need to be larger, and it\u2019s the reason that bathrooms are larger in the US than in Europe. An example floor plan shown to survey recipients, optimized for roommates. An equivalently-sized apartment, this time with three bedrooms. When you ask people who are open to having kids about the features in a floor plan they value, they\u2019re willing to give up other things to get extra bedrooms. What are they willing to give up? Bedrooms are far and away the highest asset they want \u2014 over everything else, including yard, price, and space. We could not find one asset that they preferred more. When you think about it from first principles, you want another place to put your child. Everyone who\u2019s lived in the city knows that parents are resourceful. In New York, I knew plenty of people who used a second bathroom, a closet, or put up a temporary wall. You figure out some way to get your child in their own space. Obviously there are some people who do co-sleeping, but by some point, you want the kids to have their own little area where they can hit their bedtime at 7:00 PM, and the parents don\u2019t have to go to sleep at the same time. In your survey, the only apartment feature people hated more than they wanted the extra bedroom was a tenth-floor walkup. I didn\u2019t say it partly because that one was absurd, but that\u2019s right. There might be. They\u2019re not allowed to be built, so new housing can\u2019t do that. Once you get up to four stories \u2014 three in some places \u2014 you have to put in an elevator. If it exists, it is a vestige of an earlier time. You might find it in some part of a city that\u2019s over 140 years old. But it would be very unusual. People really want extra bedrooms and hate the idea of a 10th-floor walkup. When my wife was pregnant with our first, we had to move out of our Manhattan one-bedroom. I visited a bunch of listings, and there was a place in Chinatown that I loved, but it was a fifth-floor walkup. I was trying to rationalize in my head, \u201cCan I sell this situation to my pregnant wife?\u201d If there\u2019s one thing I want the company to do, it\u2019s to build products that prevent the exact situation you described. I want people to be able to have a kid and stay. That is what the extra room gives. When people have to immediately say, \u201cNow I\u2019ve got to go find a new apartment so that we aren\u2019t moving and having a baby at the same time,\u201d that is when the city loses too many people. There\u2019s a lot of different things that the city needs to fix. But the key part about making cities better for families is that they don\u2019t have to be fixed for a newborn. Babies are small. All they need is that extra space, and then you can figure things out. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t other things that are as annoying as the fourth-floor walkup. Anyone who uses the subway who has a kid knows there\u2019s no elevators that go to any subways, and the ones that do , you probably don\u2019t want to take them \u2014 either they\u2019re unreliable or unsafe. So you\u2019re carrying the stroller up and down four flights of stairs anyway: which was good for me; it was less good for my wife. You have design features that have been imported from other housing types. Go look at any 750-square-foot one-bedroom in AvalonBay or Toll Brothers . The kitchens are enormous. They\u2019re enormous for all floor plan types, even studios. Every single one of them has a full-size kitchen range. No one ever cooks there. It\u2019s not like anyone is hosting Thanksgiving in their 550-square-foot studio. Yet the kitchen is still 14\u00bd feet long. That is driven by institutional standards: with more apartments under management, it\u2019s easier to build and manage one type of thing. Look at pictures of a kitchen with a huge island \u2014 that makes sense in a 3,400-square-foot McMansion. The kitchens are about the same size in the city, which makes no sense, but it\u2019s what\u2019s done. Anyone who takes a first-principles approach and walks into a studio would say to themselves, \u201cWhy is the refrigerator or the range in a studio the same size as in the three-bedrooms?\u201d It does not make sense. Exactly. So why is it? Housing costs elsewhere are going up. People are looking to reduce costs as much as possible. In the United States, we have not been able to manage modularized construction as well as other places. The way that we can marginally reduce construction costs is through standardization at the building level. So when someone builds a 250-unit apartment complex, they want to say, \u201cWe have 15 floor plan types, 3 one-bedroom types, and these kinds of kitchens.\u201d It becomes an easier way of designing and constructing a limited number of things on site. That\u2019s what keeps similarity there. It has become politically convenient to talk about units being held vacant. We obviously agree that no one is holding market-rate apartments open on purpose in order to make money because they don\u2019t. They lose money. There are some parts of it that are a teeny bit true, in that optimized price theory would say that if you were at 100% occupancy, the prices are too low. In an efficient market, there should be some level of vacancy, because it means that you\u2019ve raised it enough such that there are some empty units. That\u2019s trying to be very generous to those [ who believe in this critique ]. But the other part of vacancy, which actually adds 1-2%, is \u2014 think through the process when someone gives notice. In most markets, when someone gives notice, it\u2019s usually 60 or 90 days in advance. The property manager gets that notice and then decides what date they are going to place that unit available for rent. The thing that cannot happen to a property manager is that someone\u2019s lease date comes and the unit isn\u2019t ready. That either means you have to put them up at a hotel, or there\u2019s a tremendous amount of management hassle. How does an enterprising manager handle that? They say, \u201cWe do not know the state of that unit until the day it is vacated. Are we going to try and back-to-back every unit? That would be insane.\u201d So they generally push it out one or two weeks. There might be some that they turn over right away, where they\u2019ve gone into the apartment in advance, but you still won\u2019t know exactly. Someone gives notice on July 1st, you say, \u201cThe unit is available July 15th,\u201d but someone can move in between the 15th and the 30th. So the vacancy might end up being a month. Here\u2019s the other part that becomes interesting: how that plays into studios. Studios turn over at about double the rate of a three-bedroom. That\u2019s because people who are 22\u201326 are going to be changing jobs more; they might want to upgrade to something else. The more that units churn, the more building occupancy is going to decrease, due to the logistics of needing to change the carpet, or fixing the doors. That all comes back around to the kitchen question: building managers use their vacant units \u2014 they know they\u2019re going to have a few \u2014 as storage for their other units. If you need to get an apartment ready right away, and the handle on the fridge is broken, you go to one of your vacants and you pull it. As an efficient manager, you want to have similarity within all appliances, to be able to swap things out as much as possible. We were in a once-in-a-generation bull market run of institutional apartment class [ as an investment opportunity ] from 2012 to 2022. The zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) era was phenomenal for anyone involved in real estate development. Interest rates being low pushed asset values to the moon in every market. Phoenix, Austin, every urban city was going crazy. Even if you didn\u2019t do anything to increase your profitability at the unit, your asset value went up. Generationally good time to be involved in the real estate market. Since 2022, people have had to look at a lot more things like operations. If you talk to the sophisticated professional investors \u2014 the people who are now buying apartments for long-term ownership, rather than to take interest rate bets on valuations \u2014 they are focused more on those operational things. I know of several owners who own nearly 100,000 units who will pass on buildings as a result of their mix, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be too operationally complex. We know that the income is soft because we can\u2019t operate it well enough.\u201d The other interesting part of how real estate works is that developers can respond to what prices are today, but the product isn\u2019t delivered for several years. There\u2019s always this lag effect. So what I would hope is that in subsequent years, as people see the market is softening for buildings that are studio-heavy, that developers can change their product to build units that don\u2019t churn quite as much, which is why there is an opportunity for some developers to \u2014 on the margin \u2014 build slightly family-friendlier apartments. Yes, yes, yes. Most of the best ideas are ones that have been done before and proven to be true. Building for long-term ownership, aligning incentives \u2014 looking to the past, not in the nostalgic way: more like, it has worked for a while. It\u2019s one of the reasons the product I\u2019m excited about building is two- and three-story connected row homes. People have lived in those units for millennia. There\u2019s a good reason for it. So yes, pre-war units are better. We can look to reform our current building codes. One of the things I find most compelling about the Yes In My Back Yard (YIMBY) movement is people who point out the maps and say, \u201cHere are all the buildings that exist. Here\u2019s the percentage that would not be allowed today.\u201d There is certainly some level of improved regulation \u2014 there are some safety ones that are better. But generally, we have improved our ability to fire-rate buildings , we\u2019ve improved technologically, but we\u2019re still not able to build housing product that is built in other parts of the world \u2014 or even that already exists in the United States. We should go back to that, with appropriate safeguards. I\u2019m not an academic obviously, I\u2019m a practitioner, so my motive for helping the study that we did with IFS was very biased: I wanted it to have the effect of changing the product that gets built. With that caveat aside, I am leery of additional, well-intentioned government intervention. I\u2019ve had plenty of people ask me, \u201cWhat are the policies that would be putting a weight on the scale against studios, in order to increase family-oriented housing?\u201d I try to take those off the table, because I don\u2019t like that. There could be a thousand other unintended consequences. At minimum, units should be treated the same. There are some policies that are designed against apartments for families. In many jurisdictions (although not in as many cities, more so in the areas around them), parking ratios are assessed per bedroom, and not per unit. When you have that cost adding per bedroom, you will get fewer bedrooms. If you have to build a parking space for every bedroom, then you will make sure that they\u2019ll be designed for the people who will need two parking spaces, which is more likely to be two roommates, and not a young family who share a single car. What are policies that could make it better? The power that drives studios and one-bedrooms is higher rents. A 400-square-foot studio in any city in America will rent for $1,200. That is very inexpensive, even for Cincinnati, even New York, where that would be outrageous. That\u2019s $3 a square foot. But for a family apartment, $3 a square foot for a 1,500-square-foot would be $4,500. There are not many cities where that would be affordable for a two-income household, let alone a single-income household. The power of that ratio is what has driven studios and one bedrooms. It hasn\u2019t been that developers or planners or anyone is putting their finger on the scale against families. It\u2019s that it is the best use for short-term rents. There are other factors that, in small projects or individual units, can make it so that it is not as harmful [ for investors ] to build something designed for a family. It can be quite rational, as an investor, to take contrary bets. If a new neighborhood has 8,000 new one-bedrooms and studios \u2014 well, in five years, we should expect some percentage of them will be couples. Five years after that, some percentage of them should be parents. So we should build at least a portion of those [ apartments ] for those same people when they\u2019re 32. You might have met Stephen Smith : he\u2019s a friend, one of the people who\u2019s been talking about single-stair . But that\u2019s probably the easiest example of, we have improved fire rating of buildings and materials. The most straightforward difference between Europe and the United States, that would be the easiest to implement \u2014 and there has been success at the state and local level \u2014 is changing the requirement on the number of stairwells that you need to have in a building. In Europe there are more buildings that are smaller that have a single stairwell, and then fewer units off of that landing. In the United States, two stairwells are almost always required once you get above three stories. That is the justification that\u2019s given. Whether that\u2019s actually safer or not \u2014 it\u2019s mostly an issue of, \u201cIt\u2019s just safe in general.\u201d Buildings that tall, especially new buildings, are all required to have pressure-rated stairs and sprinklers. So it is extremely unusual for there to be a fire in a new apartment building. The only ones that I\u2019m aware of now are mid-construction, before the sprinkler system is in place. The number of injuries that occur in new apartment buildings in the US is extremely low. It\u2019s an issue of safe versus already safe. There are a thousand other ones that are very similar. It\u2019s one of the reasons that zoning isn\u2019t all of it. The other example is, when a decent-sized apartment building is being b"

For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: I have two children going to the University of Chicago. They love the culture and the intensity. But I have one major criticism. You have to take a common set of classes, the Core. Two things that are not included in that common core are shocking to me. You don\u2019t have to take an economics class, and you don\u2019t have to learn about evolution. You can take them optionally, but it\u2019s not required. If you think about two mechanisms that govern life, which are super important to understand, it\u2019s those two. Statecraft is me doing remedial econ education. We had Dean Karlan on , Chief Economist at USAID . I talked to Zach Liscow about infrastructure costs. You\u2019re the Chief Economist at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. So I\u2019m getting my econ education, but it\u2019s taking a while. That\u2019s great. And for those of us who are consumers of your podcast, it\u2019s not just you learning economics \u2014 it\u2019s us learning new intuitions about statecraft from you. This is the first time there\u2019s been a chief economist at CMS. The very first thing I did was survey what other chief economists and institutions have done \u2014 in and outside the government \u2014 to see what activities they engage in and how they can be most useful to their organizations. Having done that, I break down my job into three parts. The first part is to provide advice on prospective decisions. Sometimes there\u2019s writing involved, sometimes just conversations. In either case, there\u2019s some research that involves going to the literature or doing some back-of-the-envelope numbers to advise on immediate and pressing decisions. Item two is discrete projects, where instead of just providing advice to the decision maker, I\u2019m making most of the decisions. Maybe there\u2019s an updating process that goes on. I tell the administrator what I\u2019m doing and check in to see if he\u2019s got feedback. But roughly, I\u2019m managing the project myself. Often it involves improving economic decision-making in different parts of the organization. The third item is economic research on questions that are both retrospective and prospective. We may have done a regulation, or there may be a statute and we need to figure out what the impact is. Or we want to do some research to understand a topic that might have a decision forthcoming. Trying to understand, for example, how marketplaces work, or how Medicare Advantage is functioning. It\u2019s one of these jobs where there\u2019s no clear definition. You have to make the job. The thing to try to do is to become a trusted advisor to the person that you report to. You need to build up that trust capital because if you want your work to have import, it\u2019s got to be that the decision makers value it. The thing to avoid is to impose your own preferences. You bring in a set of tools. For me, it\u2019s economic analysis and understanding how healthcare markets and financing programs work. That doesn\u2019t give me the authority to displace people\u2019s preferences. If people don\u2019t follow your advice \u2014 and sometimes they won\u2019t \u2014 you can\u2019t get angry about it, because they\u2019ll stop asking you. You provide input when they ask, and let them make the decision. The main difference between academia and CMS is the speed and weight of decisions. In any given week, any decision is more important than almost any decision you\u2019ll ever make in academia. From CMS\u2019s perspective, almost all items end with a \u201cB\u201d \u2014 billions. Even when there are millions, there are usually nine digits involved. When you\u2019re an academic economist, you pick your questions, and you take your time to answer them to a certain standard of quality, usually whatever the bar is for getting into a very good journal. You\u2019ll discard questions when you don\u2019t think you can answer them to that level of quality. That\u2019s not a privilege you have when you\u2019re working in the government. Your goal is to say, \u201cWhat is the best analysis I can do in the time period allotted to make that decision?\u201d But you have to do the analysis. That means you spend more time than I anticipated letting theory guide you. Basic econ 101 \u2014 I would call it price theory , because I\u2019m from Chicago. You learn to treat problems as Fermi problems , where you don\u2019t have all the data, you just need to get an approximate solution. You do back-of-the-envelope calculations as fast as you can. You pray that the literature\u2019s already answered the question. If not, you\u2019ve just got to get what numbers you can quickly and answer the question before the decision has to be made. There\u2019s a disconnect between American health economics research and the decisions that have to be made at CMS. The main thing is not understanding the constraints that decision-makers face here, and there\u2019s a myriad of them. You can\u2019t just toggle switches on and off. Let me give you a few examples of constraints. When you want to change a regulation, there\u2019s a whole legal process set up by the Administrative Procedures Act (APA): notice and comment. You have internal clearances that add time. On top of that, there\u2019s prudential concerns: making sure you send the signal to the private sector so that they can prepare. You can\u2019t just pass a regulation and expect compliance immediately. If we made a decision today, it might be eighteen months to two years before you can see [ it in effect ]. That slows down things. A second issue is political constraints. You have to think about the coalition that is going to support your decision-making and how your decision affects them. A third issue is the resources for implementing things. Economists think, \u201cLet\u2019s change the premium schedule this way, or provide this little mechanism to provide incentive.\u201d We don\u2019t think, \u201cHow do you implement that? How many humans do you need? What tech do you need? What services do you need to have in place? What education do you have to provide to the regulated party to understand exactly how to comply?\u201d That process either may not exist or may take time to construct. You don\u2019t have a blank slate on which to rewrite rules. Regardless of which administration you work for, people say, \u201cYou should just change things to meet this particular...\u201d Oh my gosh! You have to understand when an agency\u2019s inability to take an action is due to constraints versus not being proactive. Two things should flow from this for academic health economists. The first is, economists should think about the questions that CMS or corporations need answered, as opposed to what is economically interesting in the abstract. That would give research much more impact on the world. The second is, a lot more [ research ] should focus on what you would call statecraft, or I would call implementation. \u201cWhat is the value added by the APA? How does decision-making work in the context of a political coalition? How does personnel economics function in the context of policy decision-making?\u201d There\u2019s work to be done there. One of my goals is to bring health economists through CMS so they can see that firsthand, and hopefully it informs their research when they\u2019re back in academia. I\u2019m going to put my academic hat on for a second. I want to be careful about making those assertions \u2014 although I probably share your view that we could do much better by both the consumer and the taxpayer in the delivery of healthcare. The United States roughly spends 20% of GDP on healthcare. But for the last 10 years, we\u2019ve been stuck at 20%. That\u2019s remarkable, because there were all these warnings back in the \u201890s: \u201cWe\u2019re increasing spending on healthcare and it\u2019s going to become unsustainable.\u201d But then for a decade, we plateaued and we\u2019re still trying to figure out why. So I want to be a bit careful about that assertion. From a purely economic perspective, there is no natural percentage of GDP that you\u2019d spend on healthcare. It just depends on the degree to which healthcare is a luxury good . By luxury good, I mean that as you earn more, you spend a higher percentage of your income on that particular item. Healthcare might be a good where, as you increase income, you spend a higher percentage \u2014 it could be more valuable to higher-income individuals. So I don\u2019t think that saying, \u201cIt\u2019s 20%,\u201d means this is or isn\u2019t too much. You have to give an additional reason why it might be too much. First, you have to understand the inputs into health in the United States versus other places. If the inputs \u2014 meaning the underlying health, the human capital of the population \u2014 are lower to start with, it might not be that we\u2019re getting a bad result. It could just be that we\u2019re doing pretty good with a worse base. There\u2019s a super insightful paper by Alice Chen , Heidi Williams [ Director of Science Policy at IFP ], and Emily Oster that looks at why one-year child mortality is higher in the US than in Europe. They find the gaps in mortality rates don\u2019t emerge in the first month of life: they emerge in months 2 through 12. Why is that important? If you think about where the healthcare system has the biggest impact, it\u2019s the first month. But the differences in outcomes show up in months 2 through 12. It\u2019s what\u2019s going on back at home that matters. That tells you we may be starting with different baselines. Our population might not have the same longevity, in the abstract, or they may engage in other behaviors that lead to worse outcomes. That\u2019s an important takeaway: health is not the same thing as healthcare. To figure out if our healthcare is doing a bad job, we need to look at places where healthcare is having an impact, and not necessarily where community, families, or activity differ. The second point is \u2014 I value health. But people make health trade-offs. For a lot of my life I skied. Skiing is a health/happiness trade-off. We often trade our health for other things. We need to account for that. We can\u2019t just tell people, \u201cYou should always prioritize health.\u201d That lecture doesn\u2019t always work. We need to sometimes take people where they\u2019re standing. An early version of myself would say, \u201cNever skiing enough.\u201d Honestly, I don\u2019t know the answer. But we do have a different population mix. We have populations that are substantially transplanted. We are geographically different \u2014 much more spread out, we drive a lot more. Our production technologies are a bit different than in Europe, and all those things are inputs into morbidity and mortality. It doesn\u2019t necessarily make us worse or better off. To get to those answers, you need to ask things like, \u201cWhat is your income? What is your consumption?\u201d You ask about happiness. But inputs into health are not just medication. It\u2019s a whole range of things. This is what the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services [ Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ] is talking about when he says, \u201c Make America Healthy Again .\u201d There are other inputs \u2014 other than medicine and hospital care \u2014 that affect your health. I\u2019m not an expert in understanding how lifestyle maps to health, but I don\u2019t think anybody denies that there is an important relationship there. Our fertility rate is below replacement: it\u2019s currently at 1.6. Immigration helps sustain the population, but even immigrant rates are converging to the long-residing Americans\u2019 fertility rate. You get various estimates of when the US population will peak. If you ask the UN [ about world population ], it\u2019s going to be around when the world population peaks in 2080. But if you ask the Congressional Budget Office [ about the US ], you might get as early as the 2030s now. I\u2019m very excited to listen to that podcast. I agree that the pessimistic numbers are probably correct, but let\u2019s think about how that cashes out. If your fertility rate is low, your population begins to age. Our population has already begun to age, but aging accelerates. That has two impacts. First, especially when you have a program like Medicare , you are going to have a greater demand for federal spending on healthcare, because there\u2019s more elderly. But at the same time that there\u2019s greater demand for spending, there\u2019s less supply, because as your population ages, your working population declines. It\u2019s your working population that largely supplies tax revenue. Our basic problem is an affordability problem. Even if we had stable finances, you would still face an issue between medical spending today and in the future. But now, with demographic change, it\u2019s even more acute. One response, which I think is not the approach that the American voter wants, is just, \u201cLet\u2019s cut spending.\u201d Cut benefits. A second approach is to say, \u201cBefore we think about any of that, can we make American healthcare more productive \u2014 give patients more value \u2014 for every dollar we spend?\u201d If we can do that, we can make this program a bit more sustainable, despite that pressure. About 23% of federal spend goes through Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor, and the exchanges for the near poor. If you combine the three, you\u2019re talking about $2 trillion worth of spending. That\u2019s the biggest single ticket item that the federal government spends on. That doesn\u2019t even include the $300-$500 billion that the states spend. It doesn\u2019t include employer-sponsored insurance, where we don\u2019t directly fund it, but we give employers and workers a tax break for providing that benefit. I think it\u2019s helpful to break it down by type of program: each has distinct challenges, and some challenges are common across all of them. Take Medicaid. One of the problems is that it\u2019s a program with peculiar incentives. The federal government pays for a majority of Medicaid, but states control how Medicaid is operated. One implication is that states don\u2019t fully internalize the cost of their decisions. It\u2019s like going to a dinner, and your friend tells you that they\u2019re going to pay 60% of the check. You might order a bit more than you need to, or you might not be careful in making sure that you\u2019re getting the best deal when choosing a restaurant. Medicaid\u2019s an important program \u2014 don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 but I think we could do a bit better in making sure that there aren\u2019t efforts to increase the federal share or engage in inefficient, state-directed payments. In Medicare, there\u2019s traditional Medicare, where the government is the insurer and covers hospital care, physician care, and \u2014 after 2006 \u2014 drugs, through Medicare Part D. Then there\u2019s something which, if you\u2019re old like I am, you\u2019d call Part C, but young kids call Medicare Advantage. This is where the government is not the insurer. Instead, it pays premiums to private insurers, which then provide hospitals, physicians, and drugs, among other benefits. So Medicare is two programs. People can choose which to go into, and they\u2019re run differently. In traditional Medicare, where the government is the insurer, we set prices and it\u2019s fee-for-service. Providers decide what to provide. The history of traditional Medicare has been the government realizing that leads to too much expenditure and trying to pull back. We had cost-plus pricing, where we paid whatever your costs were. Then we said, \u201cOh my gosh, you\u2019re charging too much.\u201d We went from that to prospective pay pricing, where we paid a certain amount per sickness, and then you had to manage. That was still not controlling costs as well as we\u2019d like. So we switched, under the Affordable Care Act , to accountable care organizations . There, we said, \u201cThe federal government\u2019s going to shift the risk associated with extra costs from the government to providers.\u201d So it\u2019s the government, as insurer, trying to get the providers to behave efficiently. With Medicare Advantage, the private plan, we\u2019re not dealing with the providers directly. We\u2019re dealing with the private insurance companies. We have to incentivize them to take on patients that are costly, and then treat them well. We want to make sure that we\u2019re getting a good assessment of how costly different patients are, to make sure that the insurance companies take them on. We\u2019re setting insurance prices and determining risk. To keep down costs, we can do better with risk adjustment, without harming patients. Maybe even making the patients better off, because we try to make those insurance companies a bit better aligned with what the beneficiaries want. Exchanges look like Medicare Advantage. We\u2019re paying a premium support for people to get insurance through a private insurance company. Again, we want the insurance company to take on high-risk patients, so we have to think about exactly how we do risk adjustment. One thing that\u2019s common across all of these is fraud, waste, and abuse. Let\u2019s look at the fraud component of that \u2014 that\u2019s the easiest \u2014 when you illegally charge for something that you shouldn\u2019t charge for. That can happen in all these programs, and we just need to be more proactive about it. Traditionally, we\u2019ve thought about this retrospectively. Usually, what happens is Dr. Smith bills for something he didn\u2019t do. That\u2019s fraud. If those billings become big enough that we notice, we start a False Claims Act suit prosecuted by the Department of Justice. That would take a few years. Maybe there\u2019d be a settlement, a payment, and maybe Dr. Smith would be kicked out of the program. But that\u2019s a slow process. It doesn\u2019t capture everything. And importantly, the dollar went out the door. We want to switch to a program where we\u2019re doing it ex ante. We look at the data, we see patterns that suggest fraud, and before the dollars go out the door, we try to capture some of that and ask, \u201cDr. Smith, did you actually do this?\u201d Our Center for Program Integrity is working on projects to do it a bit earlier. We can cover more people, in terms of protecting them against fraud, and we have a better sense of exactly what we\u2019re doing. First, let me give you a simple definition of fraud. One of the challenges is that fraud is governed by a whole litany of federal and state statutes. It\u2019s very hard to teach, because the rules do different things. It\u2019d be helpful to have a simpler definition that captures what all the different statutes are trying to do. Jetson Leder-Luis and I have a paper we wrote just before I started this job, where we try to provide that. [ NB: I recommend Leder-Luis\u2019s episodes on Complex Systems and Odd Lots . ] Fraud can be defined as when the following three items do not match: What the provider should have done for the patient, given the contract with the payer; What the provider did for the patient; What the provider told the payer they did. When any of those differ from the other two, that\u2019s fraud. Let me give you three very common categories of fraud: Upcoding : You may have done the thing for the patient according to the contract, but you told the insurance company you did a bit more. Medically unnecessary care . You told the provider what you were going to do, you told the payer that you were going to do what was appropriate, but you provided more care than is required and billed for that extra care. The third is the opposite of that, substandard car"

Government work is just hard \u2014 as Dean Ball said recently about work in the White House , it can be like trying to dig through the hull of a container ship with a butter knife. It\u2019s especially easy to get policy wrong if you fixate on the wrong metrics. We talked about this with DOGE: how if you do it wrong, slashing headcount increases bureaucratic bloat and government lethargy. If you have fewer people administering the same regulatory process, the burden on the private actors being regulated actually grows. As a policymaker, your ambition and drive don\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t have your arms around the nature of the problem. This afternoon, I\u2019ve got a new op-ed in City Journal with my colleague at IFP, Jeremy Neufeld. It\u2019s called \u201c Trump\u2019s H-1B Changes Won\u2019t Work ,\u201d and in it, we try and flesh out why exactly the recent spate of changes to the H-1B visa program won\u2019t fix the problems critics identify with the H-1B. Those critics are right to say the H-1B needs reform, and they\u2019re pointing to real problems with the existing system. But (we argue) that\u2019s exactly why you need to think hard about policy implementation, and the second-order effects of changing a policy. Otherwise, you can end up doing precisely the opposite of what you intend. Case in point: The administration has made a set of regulatory moves to get higher-skilled talent into the H-1B lottery. But the moves likely won\u2019t do that. And, according to new research from the IFP immigration team , they will likely lead to even more visas going to the scammy Indian outsourcing companies that the right has correctly identified as abusers of the process. That\u2019s because the new regulation uses an arcane Department of Labor system for identifying the \u201cwage level\u201d of an H-1B applicant, and wage levels are only loosely correlated to the actual wages being offered to that applicant. If that seems bizarre to you, it really is. Read the piece ! Jeremy\u2019s a great immigration policy teacher \u2014 I highly recommend following him.

For more than a decade, critics of America\u2019s immigration system have noted how easy it is to game the flagship high-skilled immigration program, the H-1B. Critics from across the spectrum say that the H-1B lottery system makes it hard for normal businesses to plan ahead, that employers don\u2019t actually have to pay above-average wages, and that a disproportionate number of the visas get snapped up by outsourcing firms that spam the lottery with multiple entries. The critics are right. On paper, H-1B visas are meant to attract the world\u2019s best and brightest. In practice, many go to outsourcing firms importing workers with only middling skills. Finally, a reason to check your email. Sign up for our free newsletter today. Last week, the Trump administration announced major upcoming changes to the H-1B: a $100,000 fee for new petitions, and a new prioritization scheme from the Department of Homeland Security for allocating lottery slots to higher-skilled talent. On paper, the reforms seem to fix the problems the H-1B\u2019s critics have identified. In reality, they don\u2019t. A loophole in the $100,000 fee, combined with a poorly designed lottery update, will make the system worse. The changes barely raise the skill level of recipients, give outsourcers an advantage, and make it harder to hold on to top graduates from U.S. universities. The administration is right to want tougher standards for H-1B use. But to curb outsourcing firms and reserve visas for the most skilled immigrants, it must rethink the details. Start with the $100,000 fee , which is more bark than bite. In theory, raising the cost of visas should discourage employers from using the H-1B for lower-skilled work. But the fee has a massive loophole. Under current law, workers in the United States on another visa can simply change to an H-1B and avoid the $100,000 payment. Eighty percent of the people in the H-1B lottery fall into this category, usually being here on student visas. Once employers have an incentive to get people here first on another visa, that number will rise. Moreover, many of the outsourcers that regularly abuse the H-1B lottery\u2014firms like Infosys, Cognizant, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, and Tata\u2014are multinationals with access to L visas, which can be used to transfer workers from a foreign office to an American one. Right now, those companies can simply bring people to the U.S. on Ls, and then transition them to an H-1B, avoiding the fee. If the fee won\u2019t apply to the vast majority of workers vying for H-1B slots, it won\u2019t meaningfully deter system abuse. The other major change is to the H-1B lottery itself. In a typical year, businesses file more than 300,000 applications for the 85,000 visas available, which the government distributes at random. The new rule would weight that lottery by \u201cWage Levels,\u201d a pre-existing Department of Labor categorization system meant to reflect seniority within a given occupation. In this system, a job requiring decades of experience is classified as Wage Level 4, while an entry-level position falls under Wage Level 1. Workers paid at Level 4 would get four chances in the lottery; Level 3, three chances; and so on. In theory, the administration argues, this should raise the average experience level of H-1B recipients. But Wage Levels aren\u2019t the same as actual wages. The Labor Department defines them relative to others in the same occupation, so the rule doesn\u2019t favor higher-skilled jobs\u2014only more experienced workers within a given field. That means an experienced acupuncturist earning $40,000 would be prioritized over a newly minted Ph.D. AI scientist with a $280,000 offer. What the new rule does, in effect, is add a veneer of rigor to the existing system, while preserving the advantage for outsourcers and other importers of lower-skilled labor. By focusing only on hierarchy within an occupation, it shifts visas toward fields with large pools of mid-career foreign-born candidates\u2014like IT\u2014rather than toward jobs that demand greater skill. A rational system would prioritize AI scientists over tech support, surgeons over acupuncturists, and research managers over social workers. As strange as it may sound, outsourcers will get more visas under the new rule. These firms flood the H-1B lottery with registrations instead of recruiting top talent, then farm out the visas they win to other companies on contract. The workers they supply are not likely to be high-value and tend to be paid far less than other H-1B workers. Nonetheless, under the Department of Labor\u2019s definitions, the outsourcers\u2019 applicants qualify in higher Wage Levels, because their H-1B workers are older and further on in their careers. In a recent report , we calculated that under the proposed rule, the large outsourcers would get 8 percent more of the H-1B slots than they currently do. When employers can pay less than the median American\u2019s salary to an H-1B worker, it\u2019s no wonder that many believe the program undercuts wages. Now, the employers can do so with DOL\u2019s blessing--an official certification that they are paying the highest possible \u201cWage Level.\u201d So much for protecting American workers. Any changes to the lottery should weight visa awards on the actual salaries promised to H-1B workers, not a gameable construct like Wage Levels. To ensure New York and the Bay Area don\u2019t get an unfair advantage, the ranking can adjust salaries by geography to account for different costs of living. We don\u2019t agree with hard-core restrictionists on many immigration questions. We think foreign STEM students are critical to American R&D dominance\u2014a position backed by the data . But when debate flared in January over the H-1B program, it seemed obvious that everyone could agree: the system should not be a tool for employers who pay low wages or game the rules. The Trump administration has a rare chance to overhaul the H-1B. It could shut out outsourcing firms, raise the skill level of immigrant workers, give American businesses more certainty about when they can hire abroad, and ensure the program doesn\u2019t depress U.S. wages. But to achieve that, the reforms must be done right. Jeremy Neufeld is the director of immigration policy at the Institute for Progress (IFP).

    "keywords": "This episode was originally recorded on September 4th at the Abundance Conference in DC. Zach Liscow , my guest today, is a professor of law at Yale Law School. In 2022-2023, he was the Chief Economist at the Office of Management and Budget . He's also now my colleague at IFP , as a non-resident senior fellow. I have a bit of a problem today, which is that while Zach may not be a national household name, he might as well be in this audience. As most of you are aware, Zach has worked on many interesting economic topics, but especially on infrastructure costs: why it costs so much to build in the US, what the inputs are, and cross-cutting comparisons. The challenge for me today as an interviewer is that, in part because of Zach\u2019s work, everyone here now knows that infrastructure in the US costs a huge amount to build. I recently reviewed some submissions for a project on transit at IFP, and every other submission referenced the fact that the cost per mile to build a subway in New York is something like eight times more than the equivalent project in Paris. These stylized facts are now embedded in our discourse. And my problem is that this makes it a little hard to figure out how to have a conversation that isn't just all of us nodding in agreement. I'm going to try to tackle that problem, but I just want to lay my cards on the table. This is my fear, and we\u2019ll try to avoid it. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: What are some other possible explanations? I divide the things that drive up transportation infrastructure costs into four buckets: Permitting and litigiousness. Procedural rules , especially on procurement, often reduce competition, because it's hard to get competitors to go through the complex process. Personnel : the state and federal Departments of Transportation (DOTs) are maybe understaffed, especially for more highly-skilled positions. Fourth, we have weak data . It's hard to know what's going on out there in the world, and it's hard to fix the problem if you don't know the facts on the ground. I'm not going to be able to offer exact percentages to those, and it's going to vary depending on the exact project. But those are the four issues. The three P's \u2014 permitting, procedure, and personnel \u2014 and data. From Brooks and Liscow, 2019 Let's start with permitting, which is the one I\u2019ve personally spent the most time thinking about. There are many pieces of the permitting puzzle, but the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) gets the most attention. Are policy advocates \u2014 are people like me \u2014 spending too much time on permitting, and on NEPA specifically, relative to the other blockers? Yes. But I'm part of the problem. I've written a lot on NEPA: it's problematic: it should be reformed. It takes four years to do the average environmental impact statement. Then there's often litigation. Even if the project opponents lose on everything, it takes a year and a half for the median lawsuit. If they win on one thing, it takes two and a half years, and then you can appeal. [ NB: My colleagues at IFP have termed this cycle \u201c the litigation doom loop .\u201d ] It takes time and money to write the report. But the issue is more the things that you do, either defensively or reactively, to the project itself. They make it much more expensive. In my paper \" Infrastructure Costs ,\" with Leah Brooks , we talk about this section of interstate outside of Detroit. There were some earlier sections that were built cheaply and quickly in the '60s. Then various things happened for the last segment. There was a lawsuit: it was challenged under NEPA and it costs several times as much. They built sound walls, it was built below ground, there were parks built on top of the highway next to fields. It's not an area where lots of open space was needed, but these things were all done to get the lawsuits to stop so that the thing could be built and connect the other two pieces of the highway. Interstate 696 in Detroit, partially covered by parks. One of the pedestrian plazas is outlined. From the Michigan Department of Transportation (2003). This all sounds very compelling; it\u2019s a version of a story about permitting that I've told my parents. Given that backdrop, why should we think NEPA's not the core problem? Is it under-discussed out in the world, but over-discussed by us? NEPA gets \u2014 at least for transportation infrastructure \u2014 more time than it deserves, relative to the other three buckets. There are two pieces to it. One is, there are lots of issues of permitting, especially at the state and local level, that are not NEPA: all sorts of water permitting rules and local mini-NEPAs. These things all matter as well. Then there's this whole other half: permitting is going to vary depending upon the kinds of project you're talking about. Building a highway \u2014 a linear project, above-ground, where you're going to have to knock stuff down \u2014 that's going to have significant environmental impacts. Some people are going to be upset, there's a good chance of a lawsuit. Permitting's important there. Other things \u2014 a tunnel underground in New York \u2014 the litigation about environmental impacts, that's not the main thing. Yet the miles in New York City are the most expensive ever built in the world, for no reason having to do with geography. For that, you want to look at procedures, personnel, and, at a high level, the data that we lack to understand what's going on. I have a paper with Cailin Slattery and Will Nober studying transportation construction in California. We assemble data on the individual engineers involved in transportation projects. What we found shifted my views about the basic issues that drive up costs. First, we found that when an extra 1% of state engineers retire, costs go up by 4.5%, which is a big effect. If you increase the quality of engineers working for the state from the 25th to the 75th percentile, that results in huge cost savings. The savings are three times the amount it costs to hire one of these engineers. So you should be willing to pay a gigantic amount to increase quality or reduce retirements, because it would pay for itself. There\u2019s a phenomenon called wage compression in the public sector \u2014 state governments don't pay that much for highly-skilled workers. [ In a recent episode of Statecraft , Judge Glock explained public-sector wage compression in more detail. ] So a lot of these people work in state government for a handful of years, then go work in the private sector and have a much higher salary. If you could retain them, you could benefit from their expertise. From a slide deck shared by Zach In that paper, you talk about falling levels of talent at state departments of transportation (DOTs). For the last 20 years, the total number of employees at most state DOTs, and the size of the DOT relative to the rest of the state government, have dropped. Why is that? It's a huge issue. State DOTs are doing more, yet they have fewer people. There are a few theories. One is, we had a financial crisis that imposed huge pressure on the states. What you often see \u2014 this is definitely the case in Connecticut \u2014 is that the thing you cut is not Medicaid, it\u2019s not services. You cut the workers who implement things across government. The impacts of these things are often diffuse and long-term, whereas a cut to some benefits program, or paving fewer highways, would be salient and opposed. States have balanced budget requirements, so they\u2019re under more fiscal stress than the federal government, and this appears to be the way that they have dealt with it. My paper suggests that's counterproductive and self-defeating. If you look at civil engineers \u2014 the people who build transportation \u2014 over the last quarter-century, the number in government has been flat. There's been this explosion outside government. What that says to me is, we're outsourcing more and more. We need to outsource \u2014 the people who build transportation infrastructure [ shovels in ground ] are 100% private contractors. But you need to have the capacity inside government to manage this very complex process: to choose what to build, permit it, put the thing out to bid, and then manage this complex thing. If you don't have enough people inside government, you're not going to have enough contractors who bid on the thing. You're not going to manage them well. You're going to change your mind, which is very expensive. You're going to let them take you for a ride. So there are lots of reasons to think that, if you have too few people in government, you're going to outsource too much, which ends up being very expensive. Quality engineers matter most in places with less competition, which suggests that one of the ways state engineers matter is that they bring in more bidders. They have simpler procedures that are easier for bidders to understand. One possible mechanism is, they bring in more competition. The level of competition in these bids is astonishingly low: the typical bid has three bidders, and yet states do almost no outreach to try to increase that number. If you have the same bidders coming over and over again, and there aren't many of them, reduced competition can drive up prices. Sophisticated bureaucrats are going to increase competition to reduce costs. The choke point is these highly-skilled engineers. That's where the pay compression hits. They're highly educated. If they're talented, they command high salaries. We need to retain those that we have, and we need higher-quality ones. This amounts to creating more slots, and paying the ones that we have more to increase the talents of those who are working for the government. It's a very interesting set of questions that folks should look into more. I'm going to give you one hypothesis. If you think about the incentives of the engineers who work in government, many of them are going to leave and go make more money in the private sector. Maybe they don't want to rock the boat with the private contractors, who they want to be their future employers. I haven\u2019t worked for a state DOT, but from the outside, as an economist, looking at the raw incentive structure, there's reason for concern. It's a great question: \u201cShouldn't blue states be pro-state employees?\u201d One hypothesis is that it's the blue states that are under more fiscal pressure. They often spend more on Medicaid. Look at Connecticut, a blue state where I live. We have one of the highest debt loads in the country. We have three times the debt per person that Texas does, so we're under much more fiscal stress. Texas also is growing, and can grow out of the debt \u2014 blue states typically are not growing. So on average, the fiscal stress hits blue states substantially more than red. You said that you don\u2019t want to bring everything in-house. So in your ideal, Liscow-directed DOT, you're adding a bunch more engineers. What's the role of the consultants? I totally agree that you need consultants, not just for building the things, but also for planning them. Take the Second Avenue Subway , a big tunneled project. It does not make sense for New York City to hire people who are tunneling experts for 30 years, because they're only actually tunneling a small share of the time. You need to hire large international firms who are experts in this to do it. So you need enough to manage the project well, and that's going to depend upon the context. I've shifted my views about the importance of personnel in part from my own work, but also in part from the excellent work of the Transit Costs Project . They talk about the Green Line [ in Boston ] and California High-Speed Rail . These are billion-dollar projects. At one point, for the Green Line, they had five people managing this several-billion-dollar project. You need enough people to at least manage the contractors and they did not have that. The structure for California High-Speed Rail was to create a whole new organization , and it takes time to staff it up. They were managing huge amounts of money with 10 or 12 people. They started things and realized, \u201cThat doesn't work.\u201d When you\u2019re talking about concrete in the ground, it's expensive to start something and then stop and undo it. So there are questions about the right institutional structure, but their own audit suggested it did not work out well. California high-speed rail has lots of issues, but this is one of them. As an academic, part of what makes infrastructure costs so interesting to me is that there's not one answer. There are several things going on simultaneously, and sometimes they're related. You gave a great list. Something that does not get enough attention \u2014 maybe because it's the most boring word in the English dictionary \u2014 is procurement. The ratio of discussion of permitting to procurement is not where it should be, and I'm part of the problem. It does involve arcane rules. Let me give you one example. For a large number of infrastructure projects in the US, DOTs have to take the lowest-cost bidder. You put out a bid, there are a variety of bidders, and it makes sense to take the cheapest one. Except maybe the firm that had the lowest bid has a history of going way over-budget, or overtime, or having low quality, or having a proposal that's worse in some way. But often, you have to take the lowest-cost bid. In European countries that spend much less on transit, they give 25% weight to the bid and 75% weight to these other quality-related things that we often give little weight to. Some states have reformed, but many have not, and it's an arcane thing that is not working well. Let me give you another example. Part of our paper focuses on repaving. It's the simplest thing that is done in transportation. I would've thought that when a state DOT puts out a description of the project with the rules and regulations that need to be followed, it would be a dozen pages. It's, \u201cYou repave, here's where you need to repave, and here are a few rules.\u201d But these things are often hundreds of pages. States that have longer and more complex documents end up costing substantially more. This suggests that these states that have more complex procurement rules end up having more expensive projects, in part by driving out competition, in part by having more compliance that you need to figure out. Unions \u2014 I'm a liberal, I support unions. Unions are sometimes problematic. In Connecticut, if you want to hire someone and you put up a job posting, you need to hire someone internally if that person meets the minimum job qualifications \u2014 even if there's someone outside government who is way better. This is part of a union contract. It does not get much attention in this state, but that's not great practice for having a high-quality workforce. Sometimes you want government to operate differently from the private sector, but I have never heard of this in the private sector, and it strikes me as a good practice for neither the private sector nor the public sector. Two answers. One, if bureaucratic bloat means too many rules, for sure: too many state rules, federal rules, interaction between the rules. Second, there is sometimes bureaucratic bloat in terms of too many cooks. This takes a couple of forms. One is when you have two different state agencies involved. You have the state DOT and the state environment department, and they don't agree, because you're going to fill in a ditch to repair a highway. That can be problematic. I want to protect the environment, but we also need to build things sometimes. There's also bureaucratic bloat in the sense that you have the state and the federal layer. To give one example of this, there is a bridge we're rebuilding in Connecticut. It's going to cost about a billion dollars, and then also costs to operate, because it is a movable bridge: it goes up and down. Remarkably, this is a movable bridge because the US Coast Guard has apparently insisted that this two-mile waterway needs to remain navigable. You need to have a movable bridge: more expensive to build, and you have to have someone operating it. Trains have to slow down because the rail is no longer continuous. It's going to break more because it's movable. Political scientists call this marble-cake federalism , where it's not clear who has responsibility and you have multiple layers of bureaucracy and rules. In this case, it is not working out well. There were lots of very talented people, lots of people I admire, from the Biden White House. [ Pauses. ] Obviously, we were not successful at cutting costs, and I wish that had been different. Let me ask you to give us all some directives. You and I are both now at IFP, and IFP tries to pick tractable problems to work on. We want to spend our time on things that have a chance of happening. If the goal of people in this room is to get transit costs down, what's tractable? Are there easy wins available? I think there are. For personnel \u2014 especially in blue states, which tend to have the transit mega-projects \u2014 we're talking about spending more money on state employees, who are powerful constituencies. If you believe my highway results, they will often pay for themselves, so it's a win-win. In terms of procedures like procurement, these are arcane things. Sometimes, the contractors may not like bringing in more competition, or driving down costs. But you can reduce the rules they have to go through. Changing procurement rules will not generate protests in the street. Something we have not talked about tons: better data. It would take a tiny amount of funding to have much better data \u2014 to learn huge amounts about the hundreds of billions of dollars a year that we spend on this stuff. It's teeny tiny with upsides that are many times the cost. What does every project cost? What were the components of the cost? What was the timeline for those projects? Those are not, to my surprise, easily out there. It took me much longer to write the project than I expected. Those should be out there. It's public money: the public should have the data. All sorts of things have not been super well-studied. There are many ways you can procure: there's no awesome paper on lowest-cost bidding. There are lots of case studies, there's intuition that this makes no sense, but studies where you can compare places that have one process versus another would be super-useful. It would be wonderful to have much more on personnel. I've written papers on permitting. There's lots of good descriptive data out there. But in terms of the exact effects \u2014 which permitting regimes cause what \u2014 this paper does not exist \u2014 Heidi Williams and I are trying to write it. Maybe it will exist at some point, but others should get to it before we do. So this whole area is hugely important, way understudied. There's a huge amount of potential. So let me start here: We all know infrastructure costs too much in the US. There are many plausible stories about why that is. One that people would most associate with the abundance narrative is that we've built up a ton of regulation, and that regulation creates soft costs . [ My colleague Brian Potter has investigated the soft costs of building a single-family home .] Complying with the regulations creates a cost, and it increases the time it takes to build infrastructure, and the longer you work on a project, the more all kinds of costs accrue. What are some other possible explanations? Give it to us one more time so that this sticks in our heads. Let's start with permitting, which is the one I\u2019ve personally spent the most time thinking about. There are many pieces of the permitting puzzle, but the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) gets the most attention. Are policy advocates \u2014 are people like me \u2014 spending too much time on permitting, and on NEPA specifically, relative to the other blockers?

    "keywords": "When I started this series a couple years ago, the idea was more constrained than it is today. We wanted to do exit interviews with civil servants, people who were newly free to speak about their experiences and their learnings. The project has expanded: we talk to political scientists, economists, DC wonks, elected officials and people currently in government. But the core value of this project is in that original idea of getting a hold of people as they're leaving the government, pinning them to the wall, and making them reveal their secrets. Today's guest is in that mold. His name is Dean Ball . If you follow AI policy, you already know who he is. Until a couple of weeks ago, Dean was a senior policy advisor for artificial intelligence and emerging technology at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Dean and I go back a little while. Most notably, we\u2019ve served together on one of the most dominant trivia teams DC has seen. But that's not why Dean's important. Dean's had a whirlwind tour over the past few months in the federal government. During that time, he was the organizing author of the Administration's AI Action Plan , a comprehensive roadmap from the White House on federal AI policy. Today, we caught up to talk about that Action Plan, what it takes to write a strategy document for the federal government, and the challenges of implementing that strategy in the face of political, personal, and bureaucratic opposition. I've said in the past that Dean thinks more clearly about the near-term future than most people. I still think that's true, though I don't agree with him on everything here, as you\u2019ll see. He's an incredibly sharp thinker and I benefit from talking to him. How to gain influence in the White House Navigating the interagency process How to build influence in an office without formal power Is the Deep State real? Why do Democrats and Republicans consistently have different approaches to managing the White House operation? Should Dean have stayed in government? Thanks to Harry Fletcher-Wood for his transcript edits, and to Katerina Barton for her audio edits. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: To set the scene for readers, I was at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, which has no formal power. It doesn't control any budget, or particularly relevant choke points in the policymaking process. Traditionally, the OSTP ends up being like the little brother to the National Security Council (NSC), especially on tech-related issues. The NSC has way more staff usually, significantly more hard power, etc. This is the fundamental predicament everyone who's ever worked in OSTP faces. I did a couple of things. I spoke to people like you. I also identified former OSTP staffers from every administration going back to Clinton 2, and talked to them about their experiences. A consistent message that is 100% true, maybe even more true in this administration than others, is that people don't care about job titles as much in the White House. It's not to say that it's not a hierarchical place: it's totally hierarchical. One thing that I assumed would be important going in is \u2014 there's the special assistant to the president, deputy assistant to the president, assistant to the president. I was like, \u201cThat's going to be important. I'm going to have to get promoted to special assistant for AI.\u201d Turns out, nope, not at all. No one cares. The way that you gain the ability to be effective is not dissimilar from what I experienced in the private sector: be the guy people want to have in the room because they think you\u2019ll say something helpful to the conversation. Especially on a technical issue like AI, a topic on which lots of people are genuinely pre-paradigmatic. They don't have lots of inbuilt abstractions and ways of thinking about it. So, an extreme willingness to be outgoing, meeting with people, especially going to agencies in person. An effective former guest of yours gave me this advice: go visit in person all the different agencies I'd be working with the most. That ended up being enormously useful. I don't want to, because I didn't explicitly get his permission, and it was a private conversation. But it was great advice. It goes, in order from lowest to highest: special, deputy, and assistant. Assistant to the president matters because there aren't that many of those. My boss, Michael Kratsios , was Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. The president is the chair of the National Security Council, but Secretary Rubio , the head of the National Security Council, is the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. Those are important, high-ranking roles. Once you get below that and into the policy process \u2014 the sociological reality of how policy gets developed inside the White House and in the interagency process \u2014 what that comes down to is more, \u201cWho is in the room? Who knows about this? Who is looped in on this?\u201d You know how government is. Plausibly, everyone can be invited to the conversation, especially a topic as wide-ranging as AI. I found it so amusing too, because it sounds like a lefty word, and yet it was used throughout the Trump administration. I heard through-and-through MAGA people saying, \u201cOur department has equities in this.\u201d Very often, power is more organic and more connected to, \u201cWho do we think is going to create value? Who knows what they're talking about here?\u201d Because that's the most important thing. Everything in the White House operates on such incredibly short timescales. The White House Chief of Staff's event horizon is like 10 days. Anything beyond that is impossibly far away. When those people need information and counsel, they need it now. So who can deliver that? The Obama OSTP was organized around certain principles, and Tom has talked about writing those principles on a whiteboard in his office. Principles like \u201cOwn the paper\u201d \u2014 whoever owns the documentation for the project is the person in charge. \u201cAlways be trying to solve other people's problems for them.\u201d Be the person who first comes to mind when someone else in the White House has a problem. In the OSTP you served in, what were the organizing principles? It's funny, because I saw this transition over time. Those organizing principles would not be bad ones. Michael Kratsios is a very intelligent, savvy person, because one of the things that happened early in the administration \u2014 day two or three \u2014 is OSTP got tasked with the lead role in authoring the AI Action Plan. We, in governmental terms, held the pen. For the vast majority of that process, I personally held the pen. The reason that's powerful is that you have an interagency process, and you get a bunch of feedback. Every agency says blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. \u201cNo, not this, change this wording,\u201d etc. Sometimes, those bits of feedback are purely good, useful things that make the document better. Other times, they conflict with what other agencies want, and the person who adjudicates is the person who holds the pen. Fundamentally, that's a mechanical reality. The idea of making other people's lives easier is a good strategy in life. In most administrations, OSTP is the little brother to the National Security Council. One common strategy that I heard from people was, \u201cBe friends with your counterparts at the National Security Council. Don't view them as rivals. Take stuff off their plate.\u201d Because in most administrations \u2014 as a practical matter, in the Biden administration \u2014 the National Security Council runs the country. They're leading the vast majority of the policy processes that matter. All that was very true and it served me well in the first month or so. In late May, Secretary Rubio completely reorganized the National Security Council. This was a serious opportunity for OSTP. We had a very good relationship with NSC: there was never any fighting or turf wars \u2014 the stuff I heard from previous administrations did not happen. But because a lot of that reorganization from Secretary Rubio did focus on tech-related things, a lot of policy processes that the National Security Council had been sharing were transferred by default to OSTP. Anything vaguely AI-related was transferred by default to me. For example, there's an executive order that's in draft, that, at some point, someone thought it was a good idea to do. Now, we are taking the draft, sharing it with all the agencies that would have to execute it, and figuring out what it should be. It made OSTP more powerful and higher status within the four walls of the White House, and maybe a bit weaker in the interagency process. If you have everyone in the White House aligned \u2014 all the assistants to the president are aligned around a specific thing \u2014 that's quite a powerful coalition that it's hard for even a cabinet secretary to go up against. It definitely forces a compromise. It's much harder when the NSC isn't participating in that anymore. Then it's, \u201cYou're the bigger fish in the small pond of the White House, but you are a smaller fish in the grand scheme of the government.\u201d But they went about it differently. Nixon's instinct was to staff up the White House itself. Many of these White House policy councils are Nixonian creations. Whereas the Trump admin, especially in this second term, has tried to put more responsibility on Cabinet secretaries, as opposed to on the staff of the White House. Is that a fair characterization, that there's more authority given to and expected from people like Chris Wright , Rubio, and other principals? It's not universally true, but it's more true than not, probably, that that's the way it's going. The Trump 47 White House staff is significantly smaller than, for example, Biden\u2019s. Biden\u2019s OSTP \u2014 I don't have exact numbers, but what I've heard from former OSTP staff was 150 people. OSTP will grow from where it was when I left. But when I left, we probably had 25 or 30. Yet I would argue that the OSTP led by Michael Kratsios did considerably more than the Biden OSTP. So the relationship between staff and effectiveness is not necessarily a one-to-one correlation. Adding more staff can create problems, especially in a charged place like the White House. Turf wars are more likely when there's more people. For example, if OSTP had a 10-person biosecurity team and a 10-person biotech team, what would those people do? They would probably spend a huge amount of their time fighting with one another over what issue was biotech and what was biosecurity. If we had a robotics team and an AI team, who knows? But, when it comes to agency rulemaking, this administration is more hands-off as a general matter than Biden was. The story that is told publicly and that I have also heard is that things like the export controls on AI chips in the Biden administration were very heavily influenced by staffers in the Eisenhower building, which is to say the White House. That's not to say that there's no communication anymore. There's certainly collaboration between the Commerce Department and the White House in this administration. But, generally speaking, it's, \u201cThat's Commerce's rule and we're going to let Commerce do it.\u201d The president would rather exercise control over the government through Cabinet officials whom he knows well. The staff of the National Security Council alone is above Dunbar\u2019s number . That's above the number of relationships that a human can reasonably manage: even the number of directors and senior directors is quite large. The president is managing a board of directors, almost. You've seen this dynamic at the State Department as well: many of the Rubio-led reorganizations are trying to strip out some of these crosscutting roles on human rights, the environment, labor, etc, and trying to run things through an individual direct chain of command. I'm oversimplifying, but it's interesting to hear you talk about that, because it seems like a managerial philosophy that Russ Vought shares. This is one of the stories that is most profoundly underappreciated, and it's the one that makes me the angriest: that we don't have a whole media apparatus filled with Santis doing the hard reporting about this. There is a new philosophy of statecraft that is being, not just experimented with in pilot, but done at scale in the federal government. I would say that the results\u2026 we don't know, we're very early into the administration still\u2026 My experience of being inside it was extremely pleasant. It was not a soul-crushing bureaucracy at all. It was a dynamic, collaborative, congenial place to work. I've worked at think tanks and universities with way more toxic internal climates, political turf wars, and internal bureaucracy than the White House. I didn't mean to say the name of the newsletter, but\u2026 Part of it does relate to this managerial philosophy: \u201cWe're going to exercise more direct control and make sure that the lines of information are very clear.\u201d The way that the Presidential Personnel Office (PPO) is going about its task \u2014 I don't want to talk about the questions they ask you in any detail, but everyone has to do this \u2014 this is not the Trump administration, this is every administration, it\u2019s famous. They ask you questions, trying to make sure that you're loyal to the president and that you're going to be a faithful agent of the agenda that the president wants to execute. But the questions were so clearly influenced by \u2014 I don't know if the people asking them would think of it as the concept of cybernetics \u2014 but they were so influenced by cybernetics. It was, \u201cAre you good enough of an agent that you can anticipate where the president's going to come down on an issue and make a convincing case for why you believe that?\u201d Even if we know d*** well you haven't talked to the president about common law liability in AI, where do you think the president would come down on that? That's interesting. In general, there's this willingness in the administration to reconsider\u2026 Let me step back for a second. It\u2019s such a fascinating confluence of events. There's the fact that the president has a non-consecutive two-term, which is the first time that's happened in a long time. It's the first time that's happened in the era when something like the deep state exists, which is an interesting twist. The deep state is totally real. It's not conspiratorial to say that; it's a real thing. Trust me, I got the memos with the policy recommendation where it's, \u201cYou have two hours to clear this. Please let us know what you think. There's a mountain of context on this, we're not going to give it to you.\u201d That's how the deep state works. That's how it is, and they're doing whatever they want. That thwarts a lot of president,s and particularly thwarted Trump 45. Now, we have this fascinating dynamic: four years in the wilderness to contemplate what went wrong, you come back with a very detailed plan, also with the knowledge that you don't have time. You have \u2014 not a complete willingness to throw out everything about how government has worked \u2014 but, much more than is appreciated, a willingness to not do things the way they've been done, if there are more efficient ways to do it. I've heard about how an idea goes from a staffer's brain to the president's desk in the form of an executive order or another sort of policy document. I've heard about how that worked in the Biden administration, in Trump 45, and in Obama. In this admin, can tell you that the process of getting things to the president's desk \u2014 it shouldn't be easy, it wasn't easy \u2014 but it made sense. It wasn't filled with things that struck me as pointless procedural blockers. They were, \u201cNow these lawyers have to look at it,\u201d things that made sense. There wasn't turf war and pointlessness. Maybe it's also a new administration \u2014 that's also possible. I also see folks from the Biden admin paying very close attention to the way this admin has managed to move much faster. I had conversations this morning with former Biden officials, who very bluntly wished they\u2019d developed a stronger sense of the \u201cshot clock.\u201d They say things like, \u201cWe should have been much more aware that every day that passes is one day fewer to set the president's agenda.\u201d Everybody's watching how the other guy does it and trying to adjust: \u201cWe should have done it that way. We'll do that next time.\u201d That's right. To some extent it's the lessons learned. Another part of it is just culture. There's people in this admin who have a very clear sense of, \u201cWe are here to do a job, we have to get this done, and we're trying to effect genuinely transformative change.\u201d Also, that realization that the election alone is not nearly enough. That doesn't itself get you transformative change. All those are lessons that Republicans feel viscerally in a way that's very hard for Democrats, because they've been the recipients of the cultural grace for the last 20 or 30 years. So they get the cultural and political benefit of the doubt. When Republicans push against the Constitution, it is called \u201ctyranny.\u201d When Democrats do it, it's called, \u201cambition and creativity.\u201d It's called \u201cstatecraft\u201d when Democrats do it. When Republicans do it, it's \u201cevil.\u201d That's something that all Republicans are quite aware of. It affects the culture. It was cool. It was fun. Being in the Eisenhower building in the spring and early summer of 2025 was like being at CBGB in lower Manhattan in 1974. It was, \u201cMan, this guy's doing crazy stuff over here.\u201d It was a scene. There's smart people with ambitious ideas. There's an entire group of people rewriting the Federal Acquisition Regulation and reducing its length by a gajillion pages, and no one knows about it. There's an executive order , it's all public that this is happening, but nobody talks about it, in the way that there would be doting pieces about this in The Atlantic if it were a Democrat doing it. In May, there was reporting that Howard Lutnick , Secretary of Commerce, was personally approving all contracts valued over $100,000 . The report focused on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): they have over 200 contracts currently waiting for Secretary Lutnick\u2019s approval, with another 5,700 expiring this year. Officials at the NOAA were quoted saying, \u201cEverything has ground to a halt.\u201d Some of these contracts were bulk procurements of office supplies, things like that. The Nixon administration ran into this same issue. By enforcing a hierarchy for every decision, you create these roadblocks at the top. Of course the Secretary doesn't have time to sign off on everything, but the result is institutional lethargy. What do you make of that concern? That's a failure mode of this style of management that can be just as true in a corporation. The interesting way that this gets balanced is: the president is not a micromanager. He wants to trust that if he wants something to happen, it will happen. Everyone in the administration completely gets that. But once he feels comfortable that the people are in place and that he's figured out the goals that he wants to articulate, he's not necessarily going to micromanage things. Different cabinet secretaries have very different approaches to this. There are cabinet secretaries who are total micromanagers, and there are others who are quite willing to delegate important things to staff. Pairing this style of management with a micromanager is a very likely way to create this failure case. It's not just that that style of management bottlenecks things at the very top. It also creates an incentive for the direct deputies to also be that way. It's a series of bottlenecks, because if the secretary of a department says, \u201cI want everything like this to come across my desk.\u201d The person's deputy, who would've typically been responsible for that, probably still has an incentive to be a chokepoint \u2014 to make sure that there are not random staffers of theirs going direct"

Dan spent the better part of the last decade in China and published a yearly letter summarizing his thoughts, explorations, and eating. Breakneck is like those letters: it goes all over the place, as does our conversation. Topics include: America's overabundance of lawyers Whether our ruling class should be all economists The book collections of Yale professors One of the things I like most about Dan's work is that he's comfortable looking at China through multiple, very different lenses. Parts of Breakneck explicitly use China as a lens to think about the US and its political culture and institutions. Other parts of the book try very hard to take China on its own terms, without reading our own culture into it. It\u2019s that mix that made the book so enjoyable for me, and I hope you enjoy it too. Thank you to Harry Fletcher-Wood for his judicious transcript edits, and to Katerina Barton for her audio edits. If you like this episode, consider giving Statecraft a rating on whatever platform you listen on (Spotify, Apple Music, etc). If you don\u2019t like this episode, do not rate Statecraft on that platform. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Dan, how did your plan for Breakneck change over time? How similarly did it turn out to your initial conception of the book? When I moved to China at the start of 2017, Trump had entered the White House threatening to launch a trade war. As this morphed into a tech war, focused substantially on semiconductors, I was thinking about a book about China's technology development. I was in China writing research notes, especially focused on Made in China 2025 , this big plan to dominate the industries of the future. As I wrote research notes, I thought, \u201cMaybe I don't want to write a book about China and semiconductors.\u201d I tried to broaden my scope to think more about the US side of the equation, given that I'm a Canadian who has spent about equal parts of my life in China and the US. I am afraid I set a trap on myself that you activated! It\u2019s difficult to write a book that the writer totally wants to write. Writing is necessarily a solitary activity, but the best writers bring in some collaborative process through editing, making this a book that has broader appeal and makes more sense. I am very pro-editors. I have a great editor. I try to work collaboratively and think well with my editors. The greatest editor I know, Santi Ruiz. I recognize that the writer isn't always necessarily his or her own guide to the best piece of writing. We know from serialized fiction: Book One starts out great, by Book Seven it has collapsed. It is better to have a guide in writing: I am willing to listen when someone tells me that this part of Chinese history, though potted, needs to be recapped. I try to minimize that as much as possible and enliven the descriptions of important things, like the Cultural Revolution , or the Great Leap Forward . But I try to keep that to a minimum. The book is 288 pages \u2014 I did my best to keep it under 300. I hope this is something that people can read and say, \u201cI wish I had more.\u201d The US has been lawyerly since the founding. The Declaration of Independence reads like a legal document; most of the Founding Fathers practiced law at some point. All but 3 of the first 16 presidents, from Washington to Lincoln, had practiced law. There's still way too many lawyers in the White House and Congress. Forty-seven senators with law degrees \u2014 two senators with anything resembling an engineering degree. In China, there was a conscious effort after 1980 by Deng Xiaoping [ Chinese leader from 1978 ] to say, \u201c Mao messed up big time.\u201d Mao was a warlord and a poet. Deng's overcorrection was to promote engineering-trained people into the Politburo [ the top decision-making body of the Chinese Communist Party ] . That flowered by 2002, when all nine members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo had degrees in engineering of a very Soviet sort. I wanted to get beyond these political frameworks from the past century \u2014 terms like socialist, capitalist, neoliberal, or democratic \u2014 to try to understand what motivates the US and China today. This is my device to explain the difference between them. The Communist Party is Leninist, because it\u2019s founded by a cadre of people who view themselves as the vanguard of the revolution. Their main task is driving the country in different series of campaigns towards modernization. It is technocratic because China is pretty rational in terms of designs. You can't build a bridge or a subway system without some degree of rationality \u2014 though California has been doing its best to prove that wrong. Since Imperial times, China has been famously the country that administered the Imperial Exam [ to enter the civil service ] to all of its mandarins [ bureaucrats who administered the empire ]. China has been more technocratic than Western democracies, let's say. It has grand opera characteristics because China's rationalism shades into this preposterous hysteria, in which everything collapses in a great G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung [ \u201ctwilight of the gods\u201d \u2014 the apocalyptic finale of Wagner\u2019s Ring Cycle ], where the gods enter into Valhalla with this voluptuous noise. I don't want to take the grand opera idea too far, but there is something Wagnerian about Leninist systems \u2014 something life-or-death at all moments. The entire political system might fall because of some minor slippage. The practical and the preposterous shade easily into each other. One of my central chapters is about living in China during the three years of Zero-COVID . It started out impressively, until everything completely collapsed. At the start of 2020, I was living in Beijing, which was implementing the playbook suggested by the World Health Organization : centralized quarantine systems and closed borders, to the envy of leftist commentators, including in the United States. But as the virus became more transmissible, the government kept tightening the system. Every step looked logical on its own terms. They followed the logic of the previous step to the point where Shanghai, where I was living in 2022 \u2014 China\u2019s largest city, 25 million people \u2014 blocked people from exiting their apartment compounds for eight weeks. This is where the line between rational and irrational is pretty thin \u2014 sometimes it collapses in this grand Wagnerian finale that isn't very good for the world. Leninism is struggle. It's what they get out of bed for. There is this very broad sense among the Communist Party that it needs to modernize the population by hook or crook. Thinking back to the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Mao and the rest of the Communist Party had recovered from a brutal fascist invasion by Japan , and then fighting off the Nationalist Party , backed by the Americans, eventually dispatching them to the island of Taiwan. They were thinking, \u201cWhat does it mean to be a modern country?\u201d And they were getting their answers from Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union, which also repelled a brutal fascist invasion. This sense of struggle is baked into the Chinese political system. They\u2019re constantly mobilizing the population into a great campaign, whether to produce steel and kill all the sparrows [ to prevent them eating grain ] in the Great Leap Forward; to bombard the headquarters and decapitate the top leadership during the Cultural Revolution, including Deng Xiaoping; to modernize economically, in the case of Deng Xiaoping; or even to implement Zero COVID and tell people not to transmit the virus. China is a very campaign-driven society where the leadership treats decisions as life or death. They are serious, self-serious, and feel if they are not dragging the population somewhere, what exactly are they doing? The Communist Party is driven by centralized campaigns of inspiration in which the top leadership sets priorities, then the cadres have to implement these priorities all the way down to the village and the apartment compound. The person in charge of propaganda can be immensely powerful, because that propaganda slogan is setting the terms for what is the campaign of the moment. The leadership has this big propaganda apparatus: magazines, a dozen big daily newscasts, and The People's Daily , which is a magazine, trying to tell the nearly 100 million Party members, \u201cHere is what the Politburo is thinking, and here is what you need to do.\u201d For a while, it might be poverty alleviation. That is perennially big on the mind of Xi Jinping [ general secretary of the Communist Party, so, supreme leader of China ]. It might be environmental protection, or technological catch-up. So you get guidance from the top leadership. Qiushi (\"Seeking Truth\" in Chinese) comes from one of Mao's favorite phrases, \"Seek truth from facts,\" which Deng then promoted. It\u2019s the party's flagship theory magazine. It is a fabulous reading experience. I recommend it, Santi, get your hands on a couple. That's a good project for someone. There are other big flagship papers like The People's Daily . I did not try to read the party's pronouncements every day, that would be madness. I constrained myself to reading it once a month, when Qiushi would land in my mailbox. Every issue has the same gorgeous bright red calligraphy, from Chairman Mao himself, on a white cover. Every issue starts with a speech or an essay excerpt from Xi Jinping [ general secretary of the Communist Party ]. His essay is about three or four pages long, in a different font from the rest of the magazine. His propaganda team makes him out to be a more folksy writer than you might imagine. Now, there is also unreadable, dense prose coming out of his essays. The very first issue I picked up had an essay by Xi on dialectical materialism . But then there are other pieces that are useful for understanding how the leadership is thinking about things. The core readership consists of three groups. The first are lower-level officials in the villages and second and third-tier cities [ Chinese cities are informally designated in three tiers of size and importance ]. They want to have a sense of, \u201cThis is what I need to do to get myself noticed by the Organization Department [ which controls posts within the party ] in Beijing so that I can have a plum position.\u201d The second are retired cadres with a little bit too much time on their hands: when they're tired of playing chess and gossiping, they take a glance at the newspapers. The third are eccentrics like myself, curious about what the rest of the party-state was reading. China produces about 32% of the world's goods. But in certain areas, China has a chokehold: 80-90% of global production capacity. This includes rare earth metals. In the aftermath of the second trade war launched by Trump, China was able to suspend [ trade in ] rare earth minerals, and automakers found that they couldn't produce cars. China produces around 90% of solar panels. There's no way to get solar that's not being produced in China. This is almost every segment of the value chain, from polysilicon processing down to the modules themselves. In a lot of active pharmaceutical ingredients \u2014 antibiotics, as well as ibuprofen \u2014 China has about 90% capacity. So, within this 30% figure, there are a few hidden areas in which China is the world's dominant producer. That is a consequence of the engineering state. Engineers like to build things: roads, bridges, data centers, coal and nuclear plants. China treats building another big mega-project as the solution to any of its problems. If the economy is weak, the Politburo will announce another big infrastructure program, something like flood control. It might be necessary, but it\u2019s probably not the best use of money to try to stimulate the economy. This month they announced they're building this big dam [ the Medog Hydropower Station ] that will have something like four times the power output of the Three Gorges Dam , the next biggest. It\u2019s going to use 60 times more concrete than the Hoover Dam. The Chinese system has decided it's difficult to do redistribution. It is easier to have organized business interests say, \u201cWe wouldn't mind another subway system,\u201d or high-speed rail, or bridge. It doesn't matter if people need these things \u2014 maybe sometimes they do \u2014 but that is the corporatist way to organize things. The engineering state is characterized by leadership that is much more substantially trained in engineering than in the United States. Previously, it used to be more formal training \u2014 not all Politburo members did anything with their engineering degrees. But starting in 2022, Xi Jinping promoted people from the military-industrial complex \u2014 the people launching rockets and building fighter jets \u2014 into the top ranks of the Politburo. They have practical experience managing mega-projects. They are willing to listen to the state-owned enterprise sector as well as the economic ministries, which are always planning more shovel-ready projects. \u201cLet's build a new high-speed rail system out in the west.\u201d Or, \u201cLet's give a new subway system to this third-tier city.\u201d Maybe the most important and dangerous part of my book is that they're not just physical engineers building infrastructure. China's leadership is made up of social engineers that treat society as another optimization problem, as if the population could be torn down and reworked like another big high-speed rail project. This is why I talk about the One-Child Policy as well as Zero-COVID. In each, the number is in the name: there's no ambiguity. This is one of these ways that the Chinese leadership constrains people's choices: they believe the population is another optimization problem that could be channeled as they wish. I call that progress. 1 It is good to have our legislators not come almost entirely from one profession. But I think you raise a good challenge: if the United States has been a lawyerly society since the very beginning, how has it been able to get anything done at all? The US has been an engineering state at various points. Most notably, there were two big spurts. First, in the second half of the 19th century, when the US was building the Transcontinental Railroad , canal systems, fantastic cities with some of the first skyscrapers in the world, and projects like the Brooklyn Bridge. Second, after the war, when Eisenhower built the highways, Robert Moses tore up New York City, and the country embarked on big projects like Manhattan and Apollo . So what has been the shift? Quantity is a quality all its own , but quality is important too. The quality of lawyers in the United States changed after the '60s. Lawyers were big in government in the New Deal \u2014 Franklin D. Roosevelt and a lot of New Dealers were trained lawyers \u2014 and throughout the war. Their lawyerly training was as Wall Street deal makers. You were working for robber barons and railroad tycoons to figure out, \u201cHow do we build this railroad?\u201d Or, \u201cHow do we raise this bond offering to build these railroads?\u201d The character of lawyers changed in the '60s. This is well laid out in Paul Sabin 's excellent work, Public Citizens . Lawyers moved away from the deal-making type to the litigious, regulatory type after the catastrophes of the '50s. The US was spraying way too much DDT , Robert Moses rammed too many highways through elite neighborhoods in New York, there was catastrophic war in Asia: first in Korea, then in Vietnam. People got tired of big government, and they became skeptical of the government getting cozy with the corporates as well. There was this big movement centered in elite law schools, especially Yale and Harvard. The students decided, \u201cWe're going to sue the bastards,\u201d meaning the government, and constrain their power. Lawyers turned into people trying to block deals rather than create them. Santi, what are you, an economist? I have derogatory words to say about lawyers and engineers, but nothing I say would approach how society views economists. Should we stop building because we're rich? I don't think so. It is hard to look at cities like New York, San Francisco, or Boston and say we have enough housing. It is pathetic that California says, \u201cWe are going to build high-speed rail ,\u201d and gets nothing 20 years after voters approved it. It is pathetic that New York City cannot build subways for less than $2 billion per mile, or that it is going to take six years and a few billion dollars to upgrade a bus station . What puny civilization are we living in? I take your point that, as countries grow richer, interest groups start organizing. This is what Mancur Olson wrote about. It becomes much more sclerotic and difficult to do things. We cannot end up looking like the British, which is not the lawyerly society, but the PPE Society. Their prime ministers not only all go to Oxford University, but they all study Politics, Philosophy and Economics. They are not building almost anything, from airport runways to any sort of trains . They have insane housing prices. America needs to be something better. The US had these big growth spurts \u2014 we need another. To solve the problems we have at the moment \u2014 housing unaffordability and lack of mass transit \u2014 and to solve the problem of tomorrow: to decarbonize the economy. I'm not expecting that China will ever become a lawyerly society, because China has no lawyerly society genes embedded in its political system, as the US has. China had minimal liberal tradition throughout its 2,000 years of imperial history. The court intelligentsia was entirely captured by the Imperial Exam, which decided who became the top mandarins who advised the emperor. Very few people got close to the emperor by advocating for constraints on imperial power. The Chinese were practicing absolutism since about 0 AD, way before any European monarchs. The communist system is geared toward modernization, in the Leninist sense, as well as toward building a lot to establish its political legitimacy. You have few lawyerly genes in the political tradition, this modern communist system with a substantial disregard for people and the public interest, and a lack of environmental protection. I suspect that China will keep building, keep replacing its depreciating apartments and bridges, and treat that as the core project for the next few decades. There absolutely is. It is not my base case, but I think the way out of the engineering state is that residents in the very rich, first-tier cities, especially Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, decide that they don't want a big rare earth mineral processing plant close to them. There have been protests at trash incinerators being placed in urban neighborhoods, and instances of wealthier protesters defeating these plans. NIMBYism is endemic to any person with property. That is going to be more real and biting. Something else that is going to restrain the engineering state is higher debt levels. The Chinese government has built infrastructure that doesn't look very useful, and isn't able to pay back the value of its bonds. Their argument is that you build this bridge to nowhere, but after you build it, two nowheres become two somewheres. At various points that has been true: places desperately did need infrastructure in the past; it is valid to connect these villages in mountainous outposts. But at a certain point, given declining population, it's not going to be very valuable to build more highways, high-speed rail, subways, and bridges. China is already suffering from a high debt burden. But there is still something to the Leninist system. The Chinese government is intent on dragging its population into modernity. It's inflected by its socialist heritage: increasing the discretion of the state to build big projects is a noble act of socialism; giving money to people is a despicable act of capitalism"

    "keywords": "Today we're joined by Dr. Rob Johnston . He's an anthropologist, an intelligence community veteran, and author of the cult classic Analytic Culture in the US Intelligence Community , a book so influential that it's required reading at DARPA. But first and foremost, Johnston is an ethnographer. His focus in that book is on how analysts actually produce intelligence analysis. Johnston answers a lot of questions I've had for a while about intelligence: Why do we seem to get big predictions wrong so consistently? Why can't the CIA find analysts who speak the language of the country they're analyzing? Why do we prioritize expensive satellites over human intelligence? We also discuss a meta-question I often return to on Statecraft : Is being good at this stuff an art or a science? By \u201cthis stuff,\u201d in this case I\u2019m referring to intelligence analysis, but I think that the question generalizes across policymaking: would more formalizing and systematizing make our spies, diplomats, and EPA bureaucrats better? Or would it lead to more bureaucracy, more paper, and worse outcomes? How do you build processes in the government that actually make you better at your job? Thanks to Harry Fletcher-Wood for his judicious edits. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: That's an interesting question. I'm not sure that there's as much wrong as there once was, and I think what is wrong might be wrong in new and interesting ways. The biggest problem is communicating with policymakers. Policymakers have remarkably short attention spans. They're conditioned by a couple of things that the intelligence community can't control. They want to know, \"Is X, Y, or Z going to blow up or not?\" That's fine. However, if you say, \"Yes, probably in 10 years,\" there's nothing a US policymaker can do about it. \"Oh God, 10 years from now, I can't think about 10 years from now. I've got to worry about my next election.\" If you say, \"Oh, by the way, you've got 24 hours,\" they think, \"Oh God, I can't do anything about it. It's too late. I don't have a lever to pull to effect change in 24 hours.\" So there's always this timing-teaming problem. If I give a policymaker 2\u20133 weeks, that's optimal space for the policymaker. But a lot of the consumers of intelligence aren't savvy enough consumers to know that they should ask for that: \"In the next three weeks, lay out the three different trends that might occur in Country X, and tell me what the signposts are for each of those so that I can make some adjustments based on ground truth. So, if we see X occur, it indicates that there's a greater probability that Y will occur versus A or B.\" The questions from policymakers range from \"Whither China?\" which is so broad as to be almost meaningless, all the way down to \"Here's this weapon platform. Do we know if this weapon platform is at this location?\u201d The \"Whither China?\" questions are always driven by poor tasking. That communication between the consumer and the producer needs a lot of focus and a lot of work. In my experience, it's always an intelligence failure and a policy success \u2014 it's never a policy failure. The first to get thrown under the bus is the intelligence community. Generally speaking, yeah. Our consumers are policymakers, either civilian or military, and they're tasking. There are a couple of different ways it works. I can't speak to the current administration, but in the past, there\u2019s been the \u201c President's Intelligence Priorities .\u201d Every president has a list, \"These are the 10 things I really care about.\" The community puts together the National Intelligence Priority Framework, and it says, \"Okay, community, in all of the world of threat and risk, what do we really care about?\" They lay that out. There are some hard targets: Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, the usual suspects. \u201cAll right, let's merge those two lists, and then we will resource collection and analysis based on them.\u201d It's a fairly rational, albeit slow process, to arrive at some agreed-upon destination over the next year, two years, four years, whatever it happens to be. That's exactly right. And that leaves certain things at risk. A good example of that is the Arab Spring . If you think about a protester self-immolating in Tunisia , the number of analysts really focused on Tunisia at that moment in time was minimal. Honestly, within the community, maybe a dozen. At my old shop, the CIA, it was half of one FTE [ Full Time Equivalent ] for a period of time. Tunisia's not high on the list of US concerns. The issue is that was a trigger for a greater event, the Arab Spring. When that happens, it's affectionately referred to as, \"Cleanup on aisle eight\": there's some crisis, and we have to surge a bunch of people to that crisis for some period of time. Organizations try to plan so that they can staff around crises, knowing that we're not going to catch everything because we don't have the resources or personnel or programs. We don't have global coverage per se. HUMINT [ human intelligence: collecting information through individuals on the ground ] is slow, meticulous, and specific. If you're going to dedicate human resources to something, it's usually a big something. Case officers go out and find some spies to help us with collection on Country X. It\u2019s a very long and methodical process. We may not have resources in Tunisia at any given time because it just isn't high on our list. And then we get a Black Swan event out of nowhere. The immolation triggers a whole bunch of protests, and then [ Hosni ] Mubarak [ the president of Egypt ] falls. The administration says, \"You didn't tell us Mubarak was going to fall.\" The response is, \"We've been telling you for 10 years that Mubarak is going to fall. The Economist has been telling you for 10 years. Everybody on Earth knows that Mubarak can't stay in power based on his power structure. But we can't predict what day it's going to happen.\u201d We would love to. But, realistically, we all recognize that Mubarak is very weak, is hanging on by a thread, so at the right tipping point, he's going to go. But the notion that somehow the community missed it is fictitious. That's generally a policy utterance, you know? \"Oh, the community missed it.\" Well, not really. There are other weak spots. I think the biggest misconception about the community and the CIA in particular is that it's a big organization. It really isn't. When you think about overstuffed bureaucracies with layers and layers, you're describing other organizations, not the CIA. It is a very small outfit relative to everybody else in the community. I can't actually, that one's classified. I don't even know a good analogue. I don't know how many analysts the FBI has, but it can't be that many. I'm not even sure what the real number is today. I think there's an opportunity to employ a lot of technology for global coverage that we are not yet using, or that I'm not aware of us using. I suspect that places like Polymarket [ a prediction market where users can bet on the probability of events ] are interesting training grounds for agentic AI, or for an analyst alert. You can broaden your scope of data consumption by going outside of traditional pipelines. One thing has changed in the most positive way, and that's the utilization of open source [ publicly available material ]. Using open source was a tough ask 20 years ago. People doubted its value compared to expensive technical collection. They assumed that billions of dollars on a satellite would solve a problem that it could not solve, when in fact, open source was clearly a better avenue into knowledge. The very first public reporting about the bin Laden raid was on Twitter. It was people in Abbottabad who were witnessing this and tweeting live that this was happening. Subscribe We've talked about intelligence gathering on this show with Edward Luttwak , a longtime intelligence community observer, with Laura Thomas , who was CIA Chief of Base in Afghanistan, and with Jason Matheny \u2014 who I believe you know \u2014 who was head of IARPA, now head of the RAND Corporation. They\u2019ve offered different diagnoses of intelligence community problems. I want to hear your view. The diagnosis that Thomas and Luttwak made was that we don't have enough area expertise \u2014 enough language speakers, or people who understand the places they're analyzing. Laura Thomas talked about it in Afghanistan; Luttwak described how, in several Central Asian embassies, the State Department and intelligence folks didn't speak the local language, only Russian, and they spoke Russian badly. That\u2019s one diagnosis. Then there's another diagnosis, which Matheny talked a lot about: he tried to build prediction markets within the intelligence community. He had a successful trial, and then it got shuttered. His idea was, we need to build better systems internally for rewarding predictive accuracy. We don't do that very well: we reward getting into the President's Daily Brief, or other short-term products. What do you think of those theses? I tend to agree that we have a talent issue. It\u2019s a confluence of security and secrecy requirements, suitability for the work, and our ability to clear people to work. It's also a reluctance to engage folks that seem dissimilar from us. You want different cognitive perspectives all operating together to try to work through a problem. It's okay to have conflict, disagreement, and heartfelt discussions about whatever you're working on, as long as you manage it. That should be expected. The problem is if you never get there. If the entire recruitment, selection, and security process weeds out anybody who doesn't look like me, or doesn't have a doctorate, or something like that, we need to address that. I wouldn't be surprised if we could find clever ways to air-gap 1 the most secret work that we're doing from the less secret work, so that those two can come together in some way. I think that's reasonable. I had the great fortune of starting the Lessons Learned program at the CIA and running that for some time, and then running the one at the DNI [ Director of National Intelligence office ] as well. That was a first attempt to get the agency and the community writ large to buy into the notion. The Army does this after every exercise. They go to Fort Irwin [ the National Training Center ], run a simulation, sit down, and do a hot wash at the end of the exercise. They wake up and do it all over again. It's not an unusual thing for the services: the Army, the Navy, they all do it. The idea of Lessons Learned was, \u201cLet's get the community to buy into that process.\u201d Part of it was centralized, and part of it was, \u201cLet's just do this in your office. You don't need to involve us. You can just do it on your own.\u201d The forecasts that we do are not just analytic forecasts. They're forecasts of everything. If I've got an operational plan, there are forecasts about, \"Is it safe to go here? Am I being followed?\" all that kind of stuff. So when you're making those kinds of decisions and predictions, why not? It's universal. There has been a history program at the agency since the \u201850s. They\u2019ve had a staff historian, but the history time requirements are different than Lessons Learned. The historians would prefer to look at the missile gap [ of nuclear weapons, between the USA and the Soviet Union ] in the \u201870s or \u201860s. They like to think about that frame of time. What happened yesterday, after we did this thing, is less likely to show up on their radar. That gap is where the Lessons Learned program was trying to focus \u2014 somewhere between the old historical records and archives and today's operations and analysis. They were doing it ad hoc and without a routine that the military uses. So this was formalization, but it was also different capabilities: our methodology, process, and product was different. There's an argument that the lessons learned are more accurately described as lessons collected or lessons archived, rather than learned . Learning institutionally is hard. Not only is it hard to do, but it's also hard to measure and to affect. But, if nothing else, practitioners became more thoughtful about the profession of intelligence. To me, that was really important. The CIA is well represented by lots of fiction, from Archer to Jason Bourne . It's always good for the brand. Even if we look nefarious, it scares our adversaries. But it's super far removed from reality. Reality in intelligence looks about as dull as reality in general. Being a really good financial or business analyst, any of those kinds of tasks, they're all working a certain part of your brain that you can either train and improve, or ignore and just hope for the best. I don't mean to suggest those are dull, but generally speaking, they don't run around killing assassins. It's a lot less of that. They read, they think, they write. They write some more, they edit, they get told their writing sucks. They go back, they start over again. Some manager looks at it and says, \"Is this the best you can write?\" And they say, \u201cNo.\u201d And they hand it back to them, and off they go to write it again. It\u2019s as much of a grind as any other analytic gig. You're reading, thinking, following trends, looking for key variables. Analysts who are good on their account generally have picked up very specific tips and tricks that they may not even be able to articulate. The best performers in the agency had a very difficult time explaining how it was they went about their analysis, and articulating their expertise. That's not unusual. Experts really aren't very good at articulating why or how they're experts, but we do find that after 10,000-ish cases, they get better, because they're learning what to look for and what not to. That comes with some penalties. The more hyper-focused you are on topic X, the less likely you are to think that topic Y is going to affect it. And often it's topic Y that comes in orthogonally and makes chaos. \u201cHow do you create expert-novice teams?\u201d was a question that we struggled with: finding the right balance between old and new hands, because you wanted the depth of expertise along with the breadth of being a novice. Novices would try anything because nobody told them they couldn't. That's a very valuable thing to learn from. If you're an analyst or an analytic manager, the challenge is how to balance that structure. How are you supposed to formalize mentorship or shadowing in intelligence work, if people don't even have a clear sense themselves of why they're good or not? You're right, people aren't very good at that. They don't describe it well, or even really understand it very well. What I had hoped for 20 years ago was technology to shadow the analysts. You would have what would today be agentic AI: a digital twin that would consume information and be aligned with your decision criteria as you make decisions. It would be trained on you doing your day job and doing exercises and training. The algorithm would create a fine-tuned model of your decision criteria, and you'd have to go back and adjust it \u2014 it's not permanent. Eventually, there'll be overfitting , there are all those kinds of problems. So today, I would probably be advocating for something like using large language models to help create digital twin-like entities for analysts as they're learning their job. So that when I'm not there \u2014 I've been run over by a bus, I've retired, I'm sick \u2014 and somebody wants to tap into whatever elements of my decision criteria they're interested in, they should be able to. That's the ideal. There are lots of security issues, and I would fully expect both IT and security to go nuts. I'm sure that it would take years of negotiation. But I don't see why we couldn't get there. I had some of the same questions for him: What are the limits of building information management tools? How much can you improve efficacy by treating it like a science?\u201d My sense is, you can definitely be more rigorous about data and trying to learn from it, without saying that digital versions of analysts would be better than human analysts. I'm not sure that a digital version would be better than our analysts. I don't look at AI as a replacement technology for genuinely complex cognitive tasks. There are issues about hallucinations and overfitting and all of that. But if you understand what the real guardrails are for our use case, it will help you figure out good ways to implement it. Ideally, we should probably offload as much transactional work as we can into automation and free up more time for thinking. The problem is, it's hard to sell that to anybody. We say, \u201cWhat if we can cut two hours out of every analyst\u2019s day just by getting rid of the transactional work?\u201d Instead of filling out forms, they could be thinking deeply about this problem, or reading, or learning the language, or be in-country, getting firsthand experience. Lots of things they could be doing instead of filling out forms. When you go to get your budget and tell them, \"We're going to liberate two hours for people to think,\" you get blank stares. You go to the SSCI , the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, or the HPSCI , the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. You say, \"We're going to free up time for analysts to spend more time thinking.\" In their heads, they're like, \"Oh, great. What do we have to show for that?\" How can we demonstrate that two hours more of thinking is going to change our ability to deal with crises, or make forecasts, or negotiate? How do we know that there's a payoff there? There are ways to measure, there are KPIs, but they're not flashy or sexy. You're not going to roll into DARPA and say, \"Hey, give me a gazillion dollars because I've got this great idea to give people time to think.\" That's not what people want to hear. It can be subtle and it can be not so subtle. The subtle version is, it\u2019s been a couple of years, I\u2019ve rotated jobs, I come to a new desk, and a new analytic topic. I'm going to read in \u2014 read all the stuff that has been produced around that account before I got there. That'll give me a good idea of what the community has been saying. We call that the analytic line . If we deviate a lot from that narrative, we have to have very concrete reasons why we deviate, because that's been a consistent finding across people over time. The subtle problem is, every time I read in to that, I'm conditioning myself to think about the problem in the way we have been thinking about the problem. The more I do that, the more I fall into the same traps that everybody else has fallen into. I'm now consuming all of the things they've produced, and that is having an effect on my thinking about the account. That's very true. If we took the notion of shorting the market every day, eventually we're going to make a lot of money. Up until that day, we're going to lose a lot of money. We could do analysis like that, but the problem is what happens for the other 364 days. You have to have a lot of money to play that game. Or in the case of the agency or the community, you have to have a lot of people and resources. If you have a constrained budget, workforce, and pipeline, between the people who are onboarding and those who are retiring, you don't have the capital to play the Black Swan game. To be more attuned to that will take considerably more resources than the community has, or has ever had. And generally speaking, those resources are driven towards collection platforms, not towards humans. As a result, the trend has been more signals intelligence, more exquisite satellites, fewer people on the ground. Language acquisition is less of a priority. Is that roughly right? I think you're correct. The problem is that it's a bit of a false choice. The community thinks that if we have signals intelligence, if we can get a conversation between two influential parties within a country, that conversation is going to be more r"

When DOGE came to USAID, I was extremely critical of the cuts to lifesaving aid, and the abrupt, pointlessly harmful ways in which they were enacted. In March, I wrote , \u201cThe DOGE team has axed the most effective and efficient programs at USAID, and forced out the chief economist, who was brought in to oversee a more aggressive push toward efficiency.\u201d Today, we\u2019re talking to that forced-out chief economist, Dean Karlan . Dean spent two and a half years at the helm of the first-ever Office of the Chief Economist at USAID. In that role, he tried to help USAID get better value from its foreign aid spending. His office shifted $1.7 billion of spending towards programs with stronger evidence of effectiveness. He explains how he achieved this, building a start-up within a massive bureaucracy. I should note that Dean is one of the titans of development economics, leading some of the most important initiatives in the field (I won\u2019t list them, but see here for details), and I think there\u2019s a plausible case he deserves a Nobel. Throughout this conversation, Dean makes a point much better than I could: the status quo at USAID needed a lot of improvement. The same political mechanisms that get foreign aid funded by Congress also created major vulnerabilities for foreign aid, vulnerabilities that DOGE seized on. Dean believes foreign aid is hugely valuable, a good thing for us to spend our time, money, and resources on. But there's a lot USAID could do differently to make its marginal dollar spent more efficient. DOGE could have made USAID much more accountable and efficient by listening to people like Dean, and reformers of foreign aid should think carefully about Dean\u2019s criticisms of USAID, and his points for how to make foreign aid not just resilient but politically popular in the long term. What does the Chief Economist do? Why does 170% percent of USAID funds come already earmarked by Congress? Why is evaluating program effectiveness institutionally difficult? Why don\u2019t we just do cash transfers for everything? Why institutions like USAID have trouble prioritizing Should USAID get rid of gender/environment/fairness in procurement rules? Did it rely too much on a small group of contractors? What\u2019s changed in development economics over the last 20 years? Should USAID spend more on governance and less on other forms of aid? How DOGE killed USAID \u2014 and how to bring it back better Is depoliticizing foreign aid even possible? Did USAID build \u201csoft power\u201d for the United States? This is a long conversation: you can jump to a specific section with the index above. If you just want to hear about Dean\u2019s experience with DOGE, you can click here or go to the 45-minute mark in the audio. And if you want my abbreviated summary of the conversation, see these two Twitter threads . But I think the full conversation is enlightening, especially if you want to understand the American foreign aid system. Thanks to Harry Fletcher-Wood for his judicious edits.

In a sense, I was running a startup, within a 13,000-employee agency that had fairly baked-in, decentralized processes for doing things. Congress would say, \"This is how much to spend on this sector and these countries.\" What you actually fund was decided by missions in the individual countries. It was exciting to have that purview across the world and across many areas, not just economic development, but also education, social protection, agriculture. But the reality is, we were running a consulting unit within USAID, trying to advise others on how to use evidence more effectively in order to maximize impact for every dollar spent. We were able to make some institutional changes, focused on basically a two-pronged strategy. One, what are the institutional enablers \u2014 the rules and the processes for how things get done \u2014 that are changeable? And two, let's get our hands dirty working with the budget holders who say, \"I would love to use the evidence that's out there, please help guide us to be more effective with what we're doing.\" There were a lot of willing and eager people within USAID. We did not lack support to make that happen. We never would've achieved anything, had there not been an eager workforce who heard our mission and knocked on our door to say, \"Please come help us do that.\" Earmarks and directives come down from Congress. [ Some are ] about sector: $1 billion dollars to spend on primary school education to improve children's learning outcomes, for instance. The President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) [ See our interview with former PEPFAR lead Mark Dybul ] is one of the biggest earmarks to spend money specifically on specific diseases. Then there's directives that come down about how to allocate across countries. Those are two conversations I have very little engagement on, because some of that comes from Congress. It\u2019s a very complicated, intertwined set of constraints that are then adhered to and allocated to the different countries. Then what ends up happening is \u2014 this is the decentralized part \u2014 you might be a Foreign Service Officer (FSO) working in a country, your focus is education, and you\u2019re given a budget for that year from the earmark for education and told, \"Go spend $80 million on a new award in education.\" You\u2019re working to figure out, \u201cHow should we spend that?\u201d There might be some technical support from headquarters, but ultimately, you're responsible for making those decisions. Part of our role was to help guide those FSOs towards programs that had more evidence of effectiveness. That's right. And the number that I heard is that something in the ballpark of 150-170% of USAID funds were earmarked. That might sound horrible, but it's not. Congress double-dips, in a sense: we have two different demands. You must spend money on these two things. If the same dollar can satisfy both, that was completely legitimate. There was no hiding of that fact. It's all public record, and it all comes from congressional acts that create these earmarks. There's nothing hidden underneath the hood. There\u2019s an earmark for Development Innovation Ventures (DIV) to do research, and an earmark for education. If DIV is going to fund an evaluation of something in the education space, there's a possibility that that can satisfy a dual earmark requirement. That's the kind of thing that would happen. One is an earmark for a process: \u201cDo really careful, rigorous evaluations of interventions, so that we learn more about what works and what doesn't.\" And another is, \"Here's money that has to be spent on education.\" That would be an example of a double dip on an earmark. That's exactly right. We had two teams, Evidence Use and Evidence Generation. It was exactly what it sounds like. If there was an earmark for $1 billion dollars on education, the Evidence Use team worked to do systematic analysis: \u201cWhat is the best evidence out there for what works for education for primary school learning outcomes?\u201d Then, \u201cHow can we map that evidence to the kinds of things that USAID funds? What are the kinds of questions that need to be figured out?\u201d It\u2019s not a cookie-cutter answer. A systematic review doesn\u2019t say, \"Here's the intervention. Now just roll it out everywhere.\" We had to work with the missions \u2014 with people who know the local area \u2014 to understand, \u201cWhat is the local context? How do you appropriately adapt this program in a procurement and contextualize it to that country, so that you can hire people to use that evidence?\u201d Our Evidence Generation team was trying to identify knowledge gaps where the agency could lead in producing more knowledge about what works and what doesn't. If there was something innovative that USAID was funding, we were huge advocates of, \"Great, let's contribute to the global public good of knowledge, so that we can learn more in the future about what to do, and so others can learn from us. So let's do good, careful evaluations.\" Being able to demonstrate what good came of an intervention also serves the purpose of accountability. But I've never been a fan of doing really rigorous evaluations just for the sake of accountability. It could discourage innovation and risk-taking, because if you fail, you'd be seen as a failure, rather than as a win for learning that an idea people thought was reasonable didn't turn out to work. It also probably leads to overspending on research, rather than doing programs. If you're doing something just for accountability purposes, you're better off with audits. \"Did you actually deliver the program that you said you would deliver, or not?\" Awards over $100 million dollars did go through the front office of USAID for approval. We added a process \u2014 it was actually a revamped old process \u2014 where they stopped off in my office. We were able to provide guidance on the cost-effectiveness of proposals that would then be factored into the decision on whether to proceed. When I was first trying to understand Project 2025 , because we saw that as a blueprint for what changes to expect, one of the changes they proposed was actually that process. I remember thinking to myself, \"We just did that. Hopefully this change that they had in mind when they wrote that was what we actually put in place.\" But I thought of it as a healthy process that had an impact, not just on that one award, but also in helping set an example for smaller awards of, \u201cThis is how to be more evidence-based in what you're doing.\u201d [ Further reading: Here\u2019s a position paper Karlan\u2019s office at USAID put out in 2024 on how USAID should evaluate cost-effectiveness. ] That's absolutely right. I can say this as a researcher: to no one\u2019s surprise, it's more bureaucratic to work with the government as a research funder than it is to work with foundations and nimble NGOs. If I want to evaluate a particular program, and you give me a choice of who the funder should be, the only reason I would choose government is if it had a faster on-ramp to policy by being inside. The people who are setting policy should not be putting more weight on evidence that they paid for. In fact, one of the slogans that I often used at USAID is, \"Evidence doesn't care who pays for it.\" We shouldn't be, as an agency, putting more weight on the things that we evaluated vs. things that others evaluated without us, and that we can learn from, mimic, replicate, and scale. We \u2014 and the we here is everyone, researchers and policymakers \u2014 put too much weight on individual studies, in a horrible way. The first to publish on something gets more accolades than the second, third and fourth. That's not healthy when it comes to policy. If we put too much weight on our own evidence, we end up putting too much weight on individual studies we happen to do. That's not healthy either. That was one of the big pieces of culture change that we tried to push internally at USAID. We had this one slide that we used repeatedly that showed the plethora of evidence out there in the world compared to 20 years ago. A lot more studies are now usable. You can aggregate that evidence and form much better policies. We had a lot of support and political cover, in the sense that the political appointees \u2014 I was not a political appointee \u2014 were huge fans. But political appointees under Republicans have also been huge fans of what we were doing. Disagreements are more about what to do and what causes to choose. But the basic idea of being effective with your dollars to push your policy agenda is something that cuts across both sides. In the days leading up to the inauguration, we were expecting to continue the work we were doing. Being more cost-effective was something some of the people who were coming in were huge advocates for. They did make progress under Trump I in pushing USAID in that direction. We saw ourselves as able to help further that goal. Obviously, that's not the way it played out, but there isn't really anything political about being more cost-effective. There was a fairly large contingent of people who welcomed us, were eager, understood the space that we were coming from and the things that we wanted, and greeted us with open arms. There's no way we would've accomplished what we accomplished without that. We had a bean counter within the Office of the Chief Economist of moving about $1.7 billion towards programs that were more effective or had strong evaluations. That would've been $0 had there not been some individuals who were already eager and just didn't have the path for doing it. People can see economists as people who are going to come in negative and a bit dismal \u2014 the dismal science, so to speak. I got into economics for a positive reason. We tried as often as possible to show that with an economic lens, we can help people achieve their goals better, period. We would say repeatedly to people, \"We're not here to actually make the difficult choices: to say whether health, education, or food security is the better use of money. We're here to accept your goal and help you achieve more of it for your dollar spent.\u201d We always send a very disarming message: we're there simply to help people achieve their goals and to illuminate the trade-offs that naturally exist. Within USAID, you have a consensus-type organization. When you have 10 people sitting around a room trying to decide how to spend money towards a common goal, if you don't crystallize the trade-offs between the various ideas being put forward, you end up seeing a consensus built: that everybody gets a piece of the pie. Our way of trying to shift the culture is to take those moments and say, \"Wait a second. All 10 might be good ideas relative to doing nothing, but they can't all be good relative to each other . We all share a common goal, so let's be clear about the trade-offs between these different programs. Let's identify the ones that are actually getting you the most bang for your buck.\" Sure. Let's take social protection, what we would call the Humanitarian Nexus development space. It might be working in a refugee area \u2014 not dealing with the immediate crisis, but one, two, five, or ten years later \u2014 trying to help bring the refugees into a more stable environment and into economic activities. Sometimes, you would see some cash or food provided to households. The programs would all have the common goal of helping to build a sustainable livelihood for households, so that they can be more integrated into the local economy. 1 There might be programs providing water, financial instruments like savings vehicles, and supporting vocational education. It'd be a myriad of things, all on this focused goal of income-generating activity for the households to make them more stable in the long run. Often, those kinds of programs doing 10 different things did not actually lead to an observable impact over five years. But a more focused approach has gone through evaluations: cash transfers. That's a good example where \u201creducing\u201d doesn't always mean reduce your programs just to one thing, but there is this default option of starting with a base case: \u201cWhat does a cash transfer generate?\" Sometimes it is just that. Sometimes it's thinking strategically, \u201cMaybe we should do it as a lump sum so that it goes into investments. Maybe we should do it with a planning exercise to make those investments.\u201d Let's just call it \u201ccash-plus,\u201d or \u201ccash-with-a-little-plus,\u201d then variations of that nature. There's a different model, maybe call it, \u201ccash-plus-plus,\u201d called the graduation model. That has gone through about 30 randomized trials, showing pretty striking impacts on long-run income-generating activity for households. At its core is a cash transfer, usually along with some training about income-generating activity \u2014 ideally one that is producing and exporting in some way, even a local export to the capital \u2014 and access to some form of savings. In some cases, that's an informal savings group, with a community that comes and saves together. In some cases, it's mobile money that's the core. It's a much simpler program, and it's easier to do it at scale. It has generated considerable, measured, repeatedly positive impacts, but not always. There's a lot more that needs to be learned about how to do it more effectively. [ Further reading: Here\u2019s another position paper from Karlan\u2019s team at USAID on benchmarking against cash transfers. ] The idea of having a benchmark is a great approach in general. You should always be able to beat X. X might be different in different contexts. In a lot of cases, cash is the right benchmark. Go back to education. What's your benchmark for improving learning outcomes for a primary school? Cash transfer is not the right benchmark. The evidence that cash transfers will single-handedly move the needle on learning outcomes is not that strong. On the other hand, a couple of different programs \u2014 one called Teaching at the Right Level , another called structured pedagogy \u2014 have proven repeatedly to generate very strong impacts at a fairly modest cost. In education, those should be the benchmark. If you want to innovate, great, innovate. But your goal is to beat those. If you can beat them consistently, you become the benchmark. That's a great process for the long run. It\u2019s very much part of our thinking about what the future of foreign aid should look like: to be structured around that benchmark. One of the challenges is the psychology of ethics. There\u2019s probably a word for this, but one of the objections we would often get was about the scale of a program for an individual. Someone would argue, \"But this won't work unless you do this one extra thing.\" That extra thing might be providing water to the household, along with a cash transfer for income-generating activity, financial support, and bank accounts. Another objection would be that, \"You also have to provide consumption and food up to a certain level.\" These are things that individually might be good, relative to nothing, or maybe even relative to other water approaches or cash transfers. But if you\u2019re focused on whether to satisfy the household's food needs, or provide half of what's needed \u2014 if all you're thinking about is the trade-off between full and half \u2014 you immediately jump to this idea that, \"No, we have to go full. That's what's needed to help this household.\" But if you go to half, you can help more people. There's an actual trade-off: 10,000 people will receive nothing because you're giving more to the people in your program. The same is true for nutritional supplements. Should you provide 2,000 calories a day, or 1,000 calories a day to more people? It's a very difficult conversation on the psychology of ethics. There's this idea that people in a program are sacrosanct, and you must do everything you can for them. But that ignores all the people who are not being reached at all. I would find myself in conversations where that's exactly the way I would try to put it. I would say, \"Okay, wait, we have the 2,000,000 people that are eligible for this program in this context. Our program is only going to reach 250,000. That's the reality. Now, let's talk about how many people we\u2019re willing to leave untouched and unhelped whatsoever.\" That was, at least to me, the right way to frame this question. Do you go very intense for fewer people or broader support for more people? I definitely saw movement for some. "

    "keywords": "At the end of April, the Transit Costs Project released a report: it\u2019s called How to Build High-Speed Rail on the Northeast Corridor . As the name suggests, the authors of the report had a simple goal : the stretch of the US from DC and Baltimore through Philadelphia to New York and up to Boston, the densest stretch of the country. It\u2019s an ideal location for high-speed rail. How could you actually build it \u2014 trains that get you from DC to NYC in two hours, or NYC to Boston in two hours \u2014 without breaking the bank? That last part is pretty important. The authors think you could do it for under $20 billion dollars. That\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s about five times less than the budget Amtrak says it would require. What\u2019s the difference? How is it that when Amtrak gets asked to price out high-speed rail, it gives a quote that much higher? We brought in Alon Levy , transit guru and the lead author of the report, to answer the question, and to explain a bunch of transit facts to a layman like me. Is this project actually technically feasible? And, if it is, could it actually work politically? How to cut time off the Northeast Corridor Operations coordination as a time-saver The move away from the Mad Men commuter Was our episode on the Green Line extension wrong? For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: The report was pretty technical. We wrote the original Transit Costs Project report about the construction cost of various urban rail megaprojects. So we were comparing New York and Boston projects with a selection of projects elsewhere: Italian projects, some Istanbul subway and commuter rail tunnels, the Stockholm subway extension, and so on. Essentially the next step for me was to look at how you would actually do it correctly in the US, instead of talking about other people's failures. That means that the report on the one hand has to go into broad things, like coordination between different agencies and best practices. But also it needs to get into technical things: what speed a train can go on a specific curve of a specific radius at a specific location. That\u2019s the mood whiplash in the report, between very high-level and very low-level. \u201cOur proposal's goal is to establish a high-speed rail system on the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington. As the Corridor is also used by commuter trains most of the way\u2026 the proposal also includes commuter rail modernization [ speeding up trains ], regularizing service frequency, and\u2026 the aim is to use already committed large spending programs to redesign service.\u201d And here\u2019s the kicker: you argue that the infrastructure program would total about $12.5 billion, and the new train sets would be under $5 billion. You're looking at a $17\u201318 billion project. I know that's a big sticker price in the abstract, but it's six to eight times cheaper than the proposals from Amtrak for this same idea. That\u2019s my first question: Why so cheap? First of all, that $18 billion is on top of money that has already been committed. There are some big-ticket tunnels that are already being built. One of the things that people were watching with the election was if the new administration was going to try to cancel the Gateway Tunnel , but they seem to have no interest in doing so. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy talks about how there\u2019s a lot of crime on the New York City subway, and how liberals want people to ride public transportation more and to drive less, but I have not seen any attacks on these pre-existing projects. So, as far as I\u2019m concerned, they\u2019re done deals. The second thing is that along the length of the Northeast Corridor , this investment is not all that small. It\u2019s still less than building a completely new greenfield line. With the Northeast Corridor, most of the line pre-exists; you would not need to build anything de novo . The total investment that we\u2019re prescribing in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and most of Maryland is essentially something called a track-laying machine . The Northeast Corridor has this problem: Let\u2019s say that you have a line with a top speed of 125 mph, and the line has six very sharp curves that limit the trains to 80 mph. If those six curves are all within a mile of each other, there\u2019s one point in the middle of the line where you have six 80 mph curves. That couple-mile stretch is 80 mph, while the rest of the line is 125. Now, what happens if these curves are evenly spaced along the line? Yes. If you have to decelerate to 80 mph and back five times, that\u2019s a lot slower. That\u2019s the problem in the Northeast Corridor: there are faster and slower segments. Massachusetts is faster. Rhode Island is mostly fast. Connecticut is slow. If you have a line that\u2019s slow because you have these restrictions in otherwise fast territory, then you fix them, and you\u2019ve fixed the entire line. The line looks slow, but the amount of work you need to fix it is not that much. The Northeast Corridor (red is stretches with commuter rail) Most of the reason the Northeast Corridor is slow is because of the sharp curves. There are other fixes that can be done, but the difficult stuff is fixing the sharp curves. The area with the sharpest curves is between New Haven and southern Rhode Island. The curves essentially start widening around the point where you cross between Connecticut and Rhode Island, and shortly thereafter, in Rhode Island, it transitions into the fastest part of the Corridor. In southeast Connecticut, the curves are sharp, and there\u2019s no way to fix any of them. This is also the lowest-density part of the entire Northeast: I-95, for example, only has four lanes there, while the rest of the way, it has at least six. I-95 there happens to be rather straight, so you can build a bypass there. The cost of that bypass is pretty substantial, but that\u2019s still only about one-sixth of the corridor. You fix that, and I\u2019m not saying you\u2019ve fixed everything, but you\u2019ve saved half an hour. They didn\u2019t think that they could do Boston to New York and New York to DC in two hours each, either. There are two different reasons for their high price tags. The first reason is that they included a lot of things that are just plain stupid. For example, theirs involved a lot of work on Penn Station in New York. Some of it is the Gateway Project , so that money is committed already, but they think that they need a lot beyond the tunnel. They have turned Gateway into a $40 or $50 billion project. I\u2019m not going to nitpick the Gateway spending, although I\u2019m pretty sure it could be done for much cheaper, but they think they need another $7 billion to rebuild Penn Station, and another $16 billion to add more tracks. No. We ran some simulations on the tracks, and it turns out that the Penn Station that currently exists, is good enough \u2014 with one asterisk \u2014 even if you ran twice as much service. You can\u2019t do that right now because, between New Jersey and New York Station, there is one tunnel. It has two tracks, one in each direction. They run 24\u201325 trains per hour at the peak. This is more or less the best that can be done on this kind of infrastructure. 1 For about 30 years, they have wanted to build a second pair of tracks. This used to be called ARC, or Access to the Region\u2019s Core . It was funded, but Governor Chris Christie [ of New Jersey ] canceled it on the grounds that there could be cost overruns that the state would be on the hook for. Then Amtrak took over the project and renamed it Gateway. The cost increased subsequently, and instead of two tracks, they are going to have four tracks. They think they need 48 trains per hour at rush hour into Penn Station, which actually makes sense if you\u2019re mildly optimistic about return-to-work in New York. New Jersey is building a lot of housing by Northeastern American standards, and the demand there is mostly commuters into New York City, so in the medium term, ridership will increase. It\u2019s a sensible project to build. Unfortunately, they think Penn Station itself can\u2019t handle the doubled frequency and would need a lot of additional work. Amtrak thinks that it needs to add more tracks by condemning an entire Midtown Manhattan block south of Penn Station called Block 780. They\u2019re not sure how many tracks: I\u2019ve seen between 7 and 12. Block 780 To be clear, the number of additional tracks they need is 0, essentially because they\u2019re very bad at operations. What\u2019s the philosophical difference between how you and the rail managers currently approach the Corridor? The philosophical difference is coordinating infrastructure and operations. Often you also coordinate which trainsets you\u2019re going to buy. This is why the proposal combines policy recommendations with extremely low-level work, including timetables to a precision of less than a minute. The point of infrastructure is to enable a service. Unless you are a very specific kind of infrastructure nerd, when you ride a train, you don\u2019t care about the top speed, you don\u2019t care about the infrastructure. You care about the timetable. The total trip time matters. Nobody rides a TGV to admire all the bridges they built on the Rhone. I doubt it. I suspect that the train goes too fast to be a good vantage point. But as I said, you need 48 trains per hour worth of capacity between New Jersey or Manhattan. You need to start with things like the throughput you need, how much you need to run on each branch, when each branch runs, how they fit together. This constrains so much of your planning, because you need the rail junctions to be set up so that the trains don\u2019t run into each other. You need to set up the interlockings at the major train stations in the same way. When you have fast and slow trains in the same corridor, you need to write timetables so that the fast trains will not be unduly delayed. This all needs to happen before you commit to any infrastructure. The problem is that Connect NEC plans (Connect 2035, 2037) are not following that philosophy. They are following another philosophy: Each agency hates the other agencies. Amtrak and the commuter rail agencies have a mutually abusive relationship. There\u2019s a lot of abuse from Amtrak to various commuter rail operators, and a lot of abuse by certain commuter rail operators, especially Metro North and Connecticut DOT against Amtrak. If you ask each agency what they want, they\u2019ll say, \u201cTo get the others out of our hair.\u201d They often want additional tracks that are not necessary if you just write a timetable. Exactly. And this is why Amtrak, the commuter railways, and the Regional Plan Association keep saying that the only way to have high-speed rail in the Northeast Corridor is to have an entirely separate right of way for Amtrak, concluding with its own dedicated pair of tunnels to Penn Station in addition to Gateway. They\u2019re talking about six tracks, plus two tracks from Penn Station to Queens and the Bronx, with even more urban tunneling. The point is that you don\u2019t need any of that . Compromising a little on speed, the trip times I\u2019m promising are a bit less than four hours from Boston to Washington. That\u2019s roughly 180 kilometers an hour [ ~110 mph ]. To be clear, this would be the slowest high-speed line in France, Spain, or Japan, let alone China. It would probably be even with the fastest in Germany and South Korea. It\u2019s not Chinese speed. For example, Rep Moulton was talking about high-speed rail a couple of months ago, and said, \u201cThis is America. We need to be faster. Why not go 200, 250 mph?\u201d He was talking about cranking up the top speed. When we were coming up with this report, we were constantly trying to identify how much time a project would save, and often we\u2019d say, \u201cThis curve fix will speed up the trains by 20 seconds, but for way too much hassle and money.\u201d The additional minutes might be too expensive. Twenty seconds don\u2019t have an infinite worth. So there's coordination between infrastructure and operations, there's coordination between interstate and committee planning, and there's some kind of coordination between system maintenance and additional construction. These are two separate things that unfortunately are being bundled together in America, but not coordinated, if that makes sense to you. Maintenance is a recurring expense. It\u2019s treated as a capital expense because, if I\u2019m deciding not to pay the train drivers for the next three months, then I\u2019m not gonna have trains running. The train drivers don\u2019t work for free. But if I decide not to do maintenance for the next three months, then I could do maintenance in the subsequent three months. I can defer it: it\u2019ll cost me more in the long run, but sometimes it\u2019s worthwhile to take this cost. There is a temptation to defer maintenance, especially the long-term maintenance issues, but if you defer maintenance in the short run, in the long run, your system collapses. There was a solution to this in the \u201880s, which was called State of Good Repair on the New York City subway, where they came up with these five-year capital plans that characterize how subway investment is done today. Up until then, operations and maintenance were funded as one thing, and outside capital infusions could go towards expansion. For example, they constantly wanted to build the Second Avenue Subway in the \u201850s, \u201860s, and \u201870s. In the \u201880s, because the system was collapsing, one-third of it was under slow restrictions, and by slow restrictions I mean you were going 10, 15 mph. The trains broke down every 6,200 miles in 1982. Yes, after they fixed the system in the 2010s the breakdown rate was less than one in 100,000 miles. You could do better \u2014 there are places that scratch seven digits. Six digits means you see a breakdown on your own train once in a generation, which means you're stuck behind a train that's broken down maybe once a year. At one every 6,000 miles, you see a breakdown probably once a year, and you get stuck behind a broken-down train every week or two. New York decided to do long-term capital spending on renewal and maintenance, and it worked. Unfortunately, after it worked, everyone else copied that, and in very different circumstances, essentially reducing maintenance to a capital mega-project. Amtrak did that in the 2000s. Amtrak President David Gunn refused to defer maintenance. At the time, it was the Bush administration, and they were trying to privatize. When you intend to privatize, you will defer maintenance to look financially good for a merger. It\u2019s not unique to Amtrak or to the US. The politicals fired him. Then the administration changed, and the Obama administration was not interested in privatizing, but it was interested in investing in high-speed rail, which in the 2000s was viewed as this flashy thing. Amtrak cried poverty and said, \u201cOh look, we have this big maintenance backlog. Please give us money for State of Good Repair.\u201d Essentially, it became a way to spend mega-project money with nothing to show for it. Outside funding, like federal funding to a state or local agency, should not go to State of Good Repair. It should go to capital spending that you can say no to. Expansion of a rail line is one example. Instead, the federal government should demand that maintenance be funded on an ongoing basis, locally or regionally. With commuter rail, state regional rail programs like the Hartford Line in Connecticut, you want maintenance to be done in a very mechanized fashion, with track machines which go on the tracks. They do the work at the speed of a very slow walker, maybe one third of a mile every hour, because they're literally changing everything. They maybe unscrew the two rails from the cross ties, and then they replace the cross ties. They need to go at an extremely slow and methodical speed. And then you replace the rails. You replace the ties. You can even replace the curves. Curves are always banked or \u201ccanted\u201d: the outside rail is a little higher than the inside rail. Because you have centrifugal force pulling the train outward, you use gravity to partly countermand that force. The \u201ccant angle\u201d in the United States is not as aggressive as it can be. American regulations are not different from European regulations on this, but American practice is constantly too conservative. They don't go as fast as the regulations will permit. It\u2019s another way that you can speed things cheaply: running the trains as fast as the regulations permit, and not as fast as the accumulated practices of American railroading say that you can. There are all these 10 or 15 mph restrictions in station throats that don't need to be there. If you're going from 10 mph to 30, it doesn\u2019t sound flashy, but you can save four minutes on just the last mile into Grand Central on every Metro North commuter train. You can save two minutes the last mile and a bit between Back Bay and South Station in Boston. Both intercity trains into Boston, every commuter train into Boston, that goes by back bay. Voters are not going to care about the cant angle efficiency on a curve. They\u2019re not going to care about approach speed. However, I do think that they will if you tell voters, \u201cHere's the new timetable for you as commuters. It looks weird, but your commute from Westchester or Fairfield County to Manhattan will be 20 minutes faster.\u201d With a lot of these reports, the issue is often that there are political trade-offs. The idea of what you should be running rail service for, who you should be running it for, that ended up drifting in the middle of the 20th century. But also, the United States is so far from the technological frontier that even the very basics of German or Swiss rail planning, like triangle planning of rolling stock/infrastructure/operations, that's not done. Just doing that would be a massive increase in everything: reliability, frequency, speed, even in passenger comfort. The main rail technology conference in the world, it's called InnoTrans , it's in Berlin every two years. I hear things in on-the-floor interviews with vendors that people in the United States are just completely unaware of. That matters for things that are really boring, like how you rebuild the overhead catenary that provides the electricity that the trains are using. This is, to be clear, boring. I am a nerd for public transportation, but not for that. I had to outsource some of the nerdery to people who are that kind of overhead wire nerds. But it\u2019s actually important: the US is so far behind that the basic kind of catenary that exists on practically every low-speed regional line in Europe would be a major innovation at rather low cost. The high construction cost problem is specifically in New York, but the rest of the English-speaking world is not too far behind, unfortunately: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, London, Toronto, Hong Kong, Singapore, Melbourne, Sydney. The problem is that Connect 2035 is a staple job. It's New Jersey Transit \u2019s list of priorities \u2014 some of which are very good and made it into our proposal. You staple that with Metro-North \u2019s list of priorities, a few of which are good, most of which are terrible. You staple that with the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority\u2019s ( MBTA ) wishlist, with Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority ( SEPTA ), Amtrak, some state DOTs that are working independently of their community rail agencies because they\u2019re not used to coordinating. Coordination needed to be invented, and in the United States, it never was, because the railroads were used to competing against each other, and then they were used to competing against Greyhound, for example. They did not coordinate intercity bus and intercity rail service. To this day, these are competitive, rather than in any kind of combined system. The commuter railways in the United States did not think about coordination very much because of the demographics of the rider. The commuter rail in the United States is generally designed around Don Draper and Pete Campbell from M"

    "keywords": "[Editor\u2019s note: Happy Fourth of July! I\u2019m attending a wedding today, so this episode is from the vault, in a way, although it\u2019s its first time on Statecraft. I originally published this essay in January of 2022 on Mirror , a Web3 publishing platform. There\u2019s a reason for that platform choice: I was writing shortly after my wife had joined the core team of a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, that was attempting to acquire a first-edition copy of the US Constitution. I had been reading a history of the constitutional convention, and it seemed fitting to write about it on a thematic site. Also, yes, July 4th is about the Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution. Cut me some slack, please. ] Last month, my wife became very involved in ConstitutionDAO , a DAO that tried to buy a first edition of the United States Constitution (good write-ups of the whole affair here 1 and here ). As a result, I got to watch both the public side of that process as well as some of the behind-the-scenes, internal deliberations. I was struck by how interesting the internal deliberations were on a political level: in particular, how much of the challenge of running a successful DAO was the same kind of human, political challenge anyone faces when trying to rally any group of people to a specific end. After the DAO wound down, I realized I was largely unfamiliar with how the Constitution actually came together. So I picked up a copy of Plain, Honest Men: The Making of the American Constitution by Richard Beeman. It\u2019s a well-regarded and comprehensive history of the Constitutional Convention itself, spanning May-September of 1787. I highly recommend it if you\u2019re interested in the topic: it gets a little dry at times, but is generally very readable. Most of the Convention\u2019s major players doubted at one point or another that a workable compromise even existed. Many of the delegates felt their states had little to nothing in common, and there were constant threats by various states to pull out of a union entirely. Other delegates thought the whole Convention project was likely illegal. In those circumstances, it\u2019s a small miracle that any decision on a document was reached, let alone one that, despite its flaws, has sustained the oldest democratic regime around. Below, I\u2019ve written some governance takeaways from Plain, Honest Men . You can judge how well they fit contemporary contexts: most are points I found surprising or counterintuitive. The book is fundamentally about the social dynamics of building consensus \u2013 the formal and informal techniques the founders used to wrangle a national constitution out of 55 sweaty dudes in a hot little room. Those techniques largely carry over to other governance contexts. NB: I\u2019m going to avoid discussing governance features of the Constitution itself, as those are both more contentious and more familiar to most readers. A quick refresher: The Convention was called in 1787 to fix the existing relationship between the states, codified in the Articles of Confederation. The Articles gave the federal government no executive, judiciary, or agencies, and no authority to make states pay taxes, provide troops to a national militia, or normalize trade relations between states. Additionally, although Congress had promised soldiers a half-pay pension for life, it had no power to procure those funds. Riots by unpaid veterans forced Congress to escape Philadelphia. As a result, legislators called for a Convention \u201cfor the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.\u201d Most delegates arrived at the Convention expecting to hash out a new interstate trade system and taxation regime; only a few delegates came prepared to design an entirely new governance system. For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: Early birds get worms James Madison showed up to Philadelphia eleven days ahead of the convention\u2019s official start date. Madison was an odd man: he mumbled, was socially awkward, and got sick a lot. But he\u2019s justly considered the father of the Constitution, and much of it has to do with his pre-Convention plotting. Perhaps more than any other attendee, Madison was committed to creating a new system of government at the Convention, and arrived with a game plan already in mind. Madison had asked his fellow Virginia delegates to arrive a week early to start preparing \u201csome materials for the work of the Convention,\u201d holding strategy sessions, and schmoozing delegates from other states. But no one arrived: Madison was the weird guy who cared too much. George Washington, another Virginian, arrived ten days after Madison, but no one except the Pennsylvania delegation showed up at the assembly room until weeks after the start date (rainstorms that washed out dirt roads didn\u2019t help). Although this delay infuriated Madison, it gave him precious time to get his thoughts in order. More importantly, it helped the Virginia and Pennsylvania delegations bond before the work began. Once the convention kicked off, delegates from the two big states largely managed to set the agenda. In contrast, several states, including the powerful New York, showed up late or without their full delegation, and had little impact on the proceedings. [Side note: Rhode Island\u2019s delegates never showed up, and everyone hated them for flaking. Don\u2019t be Rhode Island.] Pre-planning works, and it pays to be the person doing it. One of the most surprising insights in the book was that Benjamin Franklin, brand-name Founding Father [ and my wife\u2019s greatx13-grandfather ], contributed almost nothing of intellectual value at the convention. Franklin was 81 in 1787, and the oldest attendee of the convention by 15 years. Given his senior status, Franklin was treated respectfully whenever he rose to speak, but almost every proposal he made was needlessly complicated, a political non-starter, or sometimes completely irrelevant to the day\u2019s debate. And yet Franklin was absolutely essential to making the Convention work. He\u2019d always been a party animal, and had recently returned from nine years in France as America\u2019s ambassador, where he threw incredibly lavish parties (drawing from his thousand-bottle wine collection) and hosted daily intellectual salons. Beeman calls him the most popular man in Paris. At the convention, Franklin made it his job to keep the alcohol flowing. According to Beeman, Franklin \u201chad a superb sense of the way in which good food, liquor, and conversation could lubricate the machinery of government and politics.\u201d Franklin wasn\u2019t the only convention member organizing social events: apparently the standard workday postgame was to join a \u201cclub,\u201d or loosely affiliated group of friends who had regular weekly dinners. Clubs weren\u2019t exclusive, and many delegates rotated in and out of clubs over the course of the summer. Most of the actual dealmaking happened at these informal, unscripted social events. Partially, this had to do with the incredibly oppressive heat in Independence Hall: to keep the Convention\u2019s proceedings secret, all windows were closed during a muggy, often 90-degree summer. But it\u2019s also true that many of the biggest rivalries of the Convention washed away over several hours of boozing. Like Franklin, George Washington was indispensable to the Convention despite not contributing much intellectually. Instead, Washington provided clout, prestige, and pressure. As the leader of the country\u2019s army, he was a rock star, with massive crowds lining the streets to see him arrive in Philadelphia. And as a famously self-controlled, serious man, Washington set a standard other delegates felt pressure to live up to. The physical dynamics of the space also helped: Washington, a big man and Chair of the Convention, sat at the front of the room, solo on a raised dais, with the other delegates in a half-circle around him. Beeman says Washington\u2019s presence turned the Convention from \u201ca scene of acrimony and disputation among self-interested men\u201d to \u201ca deliberation among thoughtful, public-spirited men.\u201d Without saying much at all, Washington conveyed to the delegates that this project mattered. Several delegates write something along the lines of \u201cIf Washington is willing to be here, this must be the real deal\u201d in their notes. He didn\u2019t miss a single day of the Convention\u2019s proceedings. Since the Convention operated in a state of almost absolute secrecy, it\u2019s hard to take away many lessons about how to do smart public messaging (that came later, in the following months when each state debated whether to ratify the document). But there\u2019s one gambit that stands out. In a story most likely placed by Franklin, the Philadelphia Packet reported that \u201cso great is the unanimity that prevails in the Convention\u2026 that it has been proposed to call the room in which they assembled Unanimity Hall.\u201d The story obviously helped public morale, but, placed as it was in Philadelphia\u2019s main paper, it also ratcheted up the pressure on the delegates to live up to expectations. Of course, it\u2019s impossible to say what concrete value the move had for encouraging compromise, but it seems likely the pressure was positive. The guy picked to take official Convention notes, Major William Jackson, \u201cturned out to be an exceptionally poor choice.\u201d Jackson arrived at the Convention with one goal in mind: lobby enough delegates to pick him as convention secretary \u2013 apparently, he thought it\u2019d be a cushy, cool role. Jackson\u2019s notes were a mess: not only were they unsystematized, but he also seems to have thrown away \u201call the loose scraps of paper\u201d given to him by other delegates. As a result, James Madison\u2019s meticulous daily notes give us the best contemporary account of the Convention, as well as a perspective that naturally plays up his role in the process and makes his enemies look worse than they were. Madison picked a seat directly next to Jackson\u2019s secretary spot, which let him glance at and take notes on documents as they were being presented. One major proposal from Charles Pinckney is mostly lost to history, because Madison wrote up his own in great detail and gave Pinckney only a couple lines in his diary. Other delegates kept their own notes, though most were much choppier than Madison\u2019s. The net result of the notes we have is to create a picture of the Convention where Madison and his key allies come away glistening, while others look perhaps more venal and useless than they in fact were. Madison was key to the Convention\u2019s success. But it probably has helped his image to be the Convention\u2019s principal narrator. Although we often imagine the Convention as a dignified, formal affair, in practice, it operated most days quite closely to your typical Discord channel. This was a conscious choice by the delegates. Officially, the Convention had parliamentary procedures for who spoke when, how to call for a vote, and so on. Most days, though, it operated as a \u201cCommittee of the Whole\u201d: something like a brainstorming session. Anyone was free to speak, and any delegate could call for a straw poll of the room on any question, even if it had already been previously voted on. The results of these votes would be considered recommendations and not formal decisions. The effect of this informality was to make the game space a little more open, and to allow delegates to change their minds on thorny questions as arguments were hashed out. Some issues came up for a vote multiple times in a day and yielded very different results between the morning and mid-afternoon. Of course, the regular doubling-back was as irritating to some delegates then as it is to decentralized decision-makers now, and there are stretches of the Convention that to modern readers seem like a waste of time, a rehash of topics that seemed settled. But by enabling unconvinced delegates to bring up the things they cared about most, the Committee of the Whole was essential to getting consensus. Just as the Committee of the Whole structure worked wonders for building consensus and legitimacy, smaller committees for specific, tricky issues managed to come up with concrete answers. After wrangling for weeks about how states should be represented, North Carolina\u2019s Hugh Williamson spoke up in favor of a committee that could settle the question: \u201cAs a Committee would be a smaller body, a compromise would be pursued with more coolness.\u201d The move works: although there\u2019s still contention and infighting once the Committee presents its compromise, there\u2019s at least a concrete compromise position which delegates can argue about. Small committees kept less important members engaged and bought into the Convention, by proving delegates could still make progress on tough issues. They helped create a shared sense among delegates that the Convention was the only shot they had at improving on the rotted-out governance structure of the Articles of Confederation. Other committees were similarly successful: the Rules Committee which formed at the beginning of the Convention to lay out parliamentary procedure, and the Committee of Detail (to tidy up wording on a variety of issues). In all these cases, getting certain decisions out of the general debate and into a back room where a small group can advance the ball avoided major gridlock and creeping disinterest. If there\u2019s one overarching takeaway from Plain, Honest Men , it\u2019s how many of the founders succeeded at the Convention by playing to their strengths. Neither Franklin nor Washington provided much in the way of concrete proposals, but both leveraged the specific advantages they had (for Franklin, high EQ and sense of social dynamics, gravitas for Washington) to steer the Convention in helpful directions. Finding your niche and filling it well seems to be as important for governance today as it was for governance in 1787. 1 Funnily enough, I now spend most workdays sitting next to the author of this New Yorker write-up. Why we had a Convention Early birds get worms Social lubricants are important Play the press carefully Big committees give you legitimacy, small committees get results Discussion about this episode"

Santi Ruiz Jul 03, 2025 85 24 19 Share Last week I was traveling, 1 this week I am attending a wedding, and the past month has been extremely busy, and as a result I have not been able to finish an essay on where DOGE has gone. In lieu of that imagined brilliant essay, here are some scattered thoughts on the state of play: where DOGE stands now, what I got right and wrong, and what we\u2019ve learned. The thoughts on DOGE in early March I wrote up garnered some attention . But it\u2019s been 3.5 months, and everything has changed. Elon\u2019s out , having called the president a pedophile and threatened to start a new political party. MAGA hates Elon, and multiple DOGE team members have left, with at least one doing a media tour and others going off the grid. Thanks for reading Statecraft. For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: I tried to be as clear-eyed as possible when covering DOGE earlier this year, and I\u2019m happy with how the piece held up in a murky information environment. I also tried to be explicit about things I\u2019d already gotten wrong over the winter, pre-DOGE\u2019s formal beginning. But there are a couple things I missed. For instance, many people (including many of you) predicted that Elon and Trump would have a falling out in the near future. I did not think that would happen as early as it did. I paid a lot of attention to the genuinely close personal relationship the two of them seemed to have (and despite the catastrophic falling out, it\u2019s still more of a love-hate relationship than an outright enemies thing). I paid less attention to my own gut sense of just how grating Elon appears to be personally, and to how quickly he was burning through political capital (and burning through basic relational good will) within the inner circles of the admin. 2 I also rather overrated the level of talent entering DOGE. Not by a huge amount \u2014 there were some genuinely impressive technical minds on the team \u2014 but there were not all that many of them . I reasoned from too few examples here. Also, plenty of them were not asked to put those talents to full use, or directed them toward the wrong goals. Some of the quite intelligent DOGE team members were/are also true believers a la Musk that slashing rampant fraud in the federal budget could solve the national debt, which made them straightforwardly worse at using their skills to identify and resolve real problems in government inefficiency. The recurring inability to read federal contracts, and the inability to get a handle on the real amount of phone fraud at Social Security, both come to mind here. I could have said something about how the fun of running DOGE played into all this. The critique that it was a billionaire\u2019s plaything was basically right, with an emphasis on play. More on this in a second, but you can make a coherent argument that Elon paid attention to DOGE for as long as it was fun, and stopped at precisely the moment it stopped being fun. The Vivek version of DOGE would have been better both politically and practically. Elon was and is genuinely fixated on the national debt. This claim received a lot of pushback earlier this year, 3 but it was always true, and is now more obviously true. Yes, you can\u2019t solve the national deficit by ending fraud in Social Security. Yes, Elon genuinely believed that you could, that there was close to $1 trillion in fraud to be prevented in Social Security, and that large chunks of discretionary federal spending is fraud too. Yes, that belief makes no sense to anyone who pays attention to how the federal government functions, yes Elon held it anyway, yes, Elon indulges in motivated reasoning often and in public. Elon\u2019s tendency to fixate on legible metrics is a big part of his success at Tesla and SpaceX, and drove a lot of the bad outcomes for DOGE. Again, this seemed obvious as an explanation, and I think is only more obvious now. As is Elon\u2019s susceptibility to information feedback loops on Twitter. Most obviously, the catastrophic decisions to break USAID emerged out of the Twitter feedback loop. 4 Political institutions follow the path of least resistance, unless their leaders work actively to avoid that flow. Why did DOGE end up cutting the contracts of the people watering office plants, and not pursuing the tens of billions of dollars of fraud mainstream observers acknowledge exists within Medicare Advantage? Because the office plant thing is easy, and Medicare Advantage is hard. Elon\u2019s insistence on legible metrics, on \u201cWhat did you get done this week\u201d speeds, and on raw dollar amounts saved on paper led to the disproportionate cutting of cheap, vulnerable, high-value work in the federal government. There\u2019s been excellent mainstream media coverage of DOGE, so someone may be able to confirm or rebut this, but my understanding is that there was never any central channel for all DOGE team members to communicate. It was all multiple cells up to Steve Davis, who reported directly to Elon. It\u2019s also my understanding that DOGE completely stopped doing all-hands meetings in March. As a result, the amount of information sharing across DOGE itself was quite limited. This seems like an unforced error borne out of worries about loyalty and leaking. It also suggests that you can fail to capitalize on the efficiency gains of getting a live data feed of how the federal government is spending money, by not actually using that data. March 6th: Trump says Elon won\u2019t get to decide who gets fired. Also sometime in March: Regular all-hands meetings with Elon end, and other reporting says Elon pulls back from DOGE/his interest begins to wane. Sometime in early April, Scott Bessent and Elon had their physical fight in West Wing, says Steve Bannon. Elon\u2019s tweets about DOGE slow down and his tweets about SpaceX increase, and then on May 30th, before and after Trump gives Elon his public Oval Office sendoff, head of PPO Sergio Gor pushes Trump to scrap the nomination of Jared Isaacman, an Elon ally, to lead NASA. 5 Elon crashes out publicly, calling Trump a pedophile, etc. No doubt the administration (largely through DOGE) has cut a lot of people from jobs in the federal government. How many people, though, is hard to quantify, both because there are active lawsuits over some of those firings, and because across the federal government, agencies are having to rehire employees to achieve administration priorities. For example: Late May: The IRS rehires thousands of employees, purportedly fired for \u201cperformance issues.\u201d June 2: After losing more than 500 employees to cuts and early retirement incentives, \u201cThe National Weather Service has secured permission to hire about 125 new meteorologists and other specialists\u2026 The weather service is also still moving forward with a stopgap measure of transferring meteorologists from well-staffed offices to ones that are down multiple meteorologists, radar technicians and other specialists. NOAA announced last month it was seeking 155 transfers to fill these \u2018critical\u2019 positions.\u201d June 6: The FDA rehires employees. At USDA, the Forest Service asks staff who took the \u201chard fork\u201d to come back, because it\u2019s fire season. June 11: HHS tells laid off employees (around 500) that they are un-RIFed. \"That notice is hereby revoked.\u201d The defense of this state of affairs would look something like, \u201cElon engineering principles! If you haven\u2019t cut too much, you haven\u2019t cut enough!\u201d This principle makes plenty of sense in engineering, and less sense when you\u2019re trying to staff the Forest Service for fire season. In some places, yes \u2014 see the early retirement work led by Joe Gebbia for an interesting example. And in other places, it\u2019s added basically reasonable procedure to limit fraud. For example , \u201cThe Dept. of Education, starting next week, has now instituted mandatory identity checks for all first-year students receiving financial aid.\u201d DOGE cited international crime rings defrauding the Department of Education as the reason to institute this extra layer of process. I was curious whether those crime rings really exist, so I asked Linda Miller, who focused on fraud prevention as Assistant Director at the Government Accountability Office. I\u2019ll footnote her whole answer, but her takeaway: yes, this is a totally reasonable thing for DOGE to focus on, and will probably save the taxpayer money. 6 But to a large degree, DOGE has added meaningless bureaucratic procedure. For instance, DOGE put a $1 spending limit on government-issued credit cards, citing risks of fraud. As a result, hundreds of thousands of minor processes are held up in the government, as employees wait for phone bills, paper, pens, and printer toner. \u201cThings like web subscriptions, payments for routine services have become a huge hassle. An hour or two of staff time would now go into what would have been a quick internet purchase for something like buying a $10 box of Ziploc bags for collecting samples \u2014 highly efficient, isn\u2019t it?\u201d You can see a similar dynamic outside DOGE, like at the Department of Commerce, where Secretary Lutnick reportedly has massive amounts of paperwork to churn through after instituting a rule that he or a high-level political appointee must sign off personally on all spending over $100,000. I\u2019ll have more on this topic in the future, but this kind of problem is historically common in attempts to get more direct control over the executive branch (Nixon faced similar paperwork burdens, for example ). 7 Clamping down on perceived political independence at lower ranks of a department can push operational tasks up to higher ranks, reducing the ability of political appointees themselves to make political decisions. I would love DOGE team members, current and former, to come on Statecraft , and I\u2019ve invited multiple. So far, none of them have bitten. But there\u2019s a lot to talk about. That invitation remains open! There is plenty of good government reform work happening in the federal government right now, alongside some boneheaded moves. As ever, my goal will be to try and give accurate accounts of both, and to let readers decide how they weigh against each other. Statecraft will continue to \u201cplatform\u201d people readers may find objectionable (and I don\u2019t really believe it makes sense to complain about very powerful people one dislikes being \u201cplatformed\u201d by us or any other outlet.) I\u2019m working on a couple essays about what we can learn from past government reform efforts. Hopefully will have more on that topic in the coming months. While on vacation in upstate NY, I got to tackle an advance copy of Dan Wang\u2019s new Breakneck: China\u2019s Quest to Engineer the Future . It\u2019s great. We\u2019ll try to get him on Statecraft this fall. In conversations with people close to DOGE, I\u2019ve pretty consistently heard them articulate a particular theory: Elon had to move fast to get things done, and the only way he could do that was by spending lots of political capital very quickly, and he burned out before he could defeat his enemies. My view is that if you\u2019re going to think in the metaphor of political capital, then you should also think about it as something you can accrue. Doing popular things increases the amount of political capital you have to work with. So does helping allies. Success gives you more political capital to work with, not less. Ezra Klein, to me , on Elon\u2019s motivations: \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical of this cutting-the-debt theory.\u201d I think gutting USAID was a bad decision, and I\u2019ve been consistent on that point. We have a great episode upcoming with former Chief Economist of USAID Dean Karlan talking about it. But some critics saw equivocation and \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d in lines like this from my March piece: \u201cThere are good things USAID funds, and wasteful things it funds, and good governance means being able to distinguish between the two.\u201d To which I would say, separate from the issues with USAID documented in that piece, the Justice Department recently \u201csecured four guilty pleas for bribery to get over $550 million in special race-based USAID contracts.\u201d It\u2019s completely consistent to think that USAID was ripe for reform, and that DOGE made a great moral mistake in freezing humanitarian aid. I trust readers to hold more than one belief at a time. Canning Jared Isaacman seems to have been motivated largely by the spite of Sergio Gor, who runs the Presidential Personnel Office and feuded with Elon. I think it\u2019s a huge mistake to pull Isaacman from contention, and it will be hard to find someone nearly as good as him. If you were a tech-aligned space innovator, would you accept the nomination now? Yes, this is accurate. Domestic and International crime rings--professional fraudsters--have been exploiting the relatively lax identity verification processes of both the Department of Education and many smaller colleges and universities to steal hundreds of millions through this \"ghost student\" fraud scheme for several years now. It seems higher ed and DOE caught on about a year or so ago. I'd say a couple things: Criminals have a near infinite supply of personal identity data that they can and do monetize in a startling variety of fraud schemes across different industries, with government and smaller organizations presenting an easier target than larger private companies who generally have more sophisticated systems to check for stolen identities The 20% statistic DOGE is citing comes from a California report. California doesn't require SSNs of students applying to its state colleges, making this scheme even easier. The rise of remote learning since the pandemic created the conditions for this scheme to flourish. It's possible to enroll in college and never have to show up anywhere in person, even as a legitimate student, so the ghost student scheme has been easy to hide. Organized crime--both domestic and international---has moved online. Street gangs are now cybercriminals. It's just too easy to cash in on the ocean of identity data available for sale as a result of almost daily data breaches. AI tools have enabled fraud to scale with alarming speed and ease. By and large the government is oblivious to this threat. Agency leaders I speak with regularly tell me fraud is not a problem at their agencies, even those doling out billions in grants and loans. These crime rings are very good at concealing their work. They use a huge network of groomed mules to launder their stolen funds allowing them to operate undetected. There\u2019s a pendulum dynamic that\u2019s happened in government reform: If you centralize control over spending, it creates bottlenecks on small processes, so reformers try to open up spending (we covered an attempt at this recently ). Over time, decentralization of spending leads to multiple duplicative and genuinely wasteful processes, which leads to the push to centralize again, etc. I want to spend some time on this issue in future and would be curious to read/"

    "keywords": "The decisions that humans make can be extraordinarily costly. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were multi-trillion dollar decisions. If you can improve the accuracy of forecasting individual strategies by just a percentage point, that would be worth tens of billions of dollars. Yet society does not invest tens of billions of dollars in figuring out how to improve the accuracy of human judgment. That seems really odd. That\u2019s a quote from today\u2019s interviewee, who has made his career helping the intelligence community predict the future better. In this interview, we discuss: Which prediction methods perform the best? How does IARPA create tech for American spies? What technologies give democracies an advantage over autocracies? Could the Internet have been designed better? Our interviewee, Jason Matheny, championed research into human judgment and forecasting at the R&D lab for the intelligence community: the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, or IARPA , which he directed from 2015-2018. As one bio notes , Matheny spent time in academia \u2014 Oxford University, Princeton University, and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory \u2014 and the startup world before joining IARPA. He developed new forecasting capabilities at IARPA\u2019s \u201cOffice for Anticipating Surprise,\u201d has spent time in the Biden White House, and now runs the RAND Corporation, a major think tank. For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: The basic ARPA model is hiring entrepreneurial program managers who are given a budget and autonomy to pick \u201chigh-risk, high-reward\u201d research problems. The program managers select researchers to fund, based either on their individual judgment or the judgment of a small selection panel. Then those researchers compete in parallel against a common set of metrics, usually with some disciplined approach to ending funding every year for teams that aren't succeeding. The three core and unusual elements are the program managers, research tournaments, and defunding research that isn\u2019t succeeding. They distinguish the ARPA model from conventional science and technology funding efforts. Program managers are recruited by office directors, typically on the basis of technical knowledge, an entrepreneurial mindset, creativity, risk tolerance, and predicted ability to succeed in pitching and executing a program. The program manager candidates make a program pitch based on the Heilmeier questions [ guiding principles for choosing ARPA programs ]. They go through multiple rounds of review, first with the office director who serves as a gatekeeper. There are other characteristics to program managers that are important. Typically, they need to get a security clearance. Program managers are given very little training or management. The main performance measure is whether you get your program approved. That process is like a cross between a dissertation defense and a pitch to a venture capitalist. The goal is ultimately to persuade this group of people that your idea could be transformative if successful. Some projects are too risky. If the premise is, \u201cIf successful, this would be transformative, but in order to be successful I have to violate the following laws of physics,\u201d or, \u201cI have to solve a problem that Nobel laureates haven't managed to solve in the last 50 years,\u201d that's going to be deemed too risky. There\u2019s some Goldilocks zone of appropriate probabilities, probably under 50% and over 5%. There are then problems that aren't risky enough, that are seen as \u201cnot ARPA-hard,\u201d even if those problems, if solved, could be transformative. Really, just from a policy point of view, what you would love is low-risk, high-reward research. You shouldn't disqualify a research project just because it turns out that it would be easier to solve. Ultimately, you should be optimizing based on the cost benefit of a particular research investment. ARPAs do not tend to go after transformative but easy problems, even if the reason they haven't been solved is because they're neglected or ignored. That's right. Across the portfolio of federal agencies that fund R&D, the comparative advantage for the ARPAs is to focus on higher-risk research. The point of having entrepreneurial program managers with relatively little oversight is to give them the ability to go after high-risk research. IARPA developed a process that we called research technology protection: Before any program started, we would do a cost-benefit analysis of making the program secret or not. It included questions like, \u201cWhere are the researchers to solve this problem? Are they in academia?\u201d In which case, most of them don't have security clearances, so we wouldn't be able to access them. If the program is secret, \u201cDoes it require a mix of academics and contractors? Does it require crowdsourcing itself to solve? Do we want to pose the problem as a prize challenge, to give it to the world to solve?\u201d You want to figure that out in advance and decide whether the costs of secrecy exceed the benefits or vice versa. And it really depends. I thought of some problems as much better to keep secret. But then you actually do the math, and you find the benefits of secrecy aren't so significant, and we wouldn't be able to solve the problem in secret. With others, the opposite is true. Stealth technology, for example, would be in the high-risk, high-reward space. That was a historic DARPA (and Air Force) investment. We had models for significantly reducing the radar cross section of an aircraft, but those models produced designs that we couldn't figure out how to fly. That was technically risky. But the impact on military operations, if successful, was going to be transformative. It would mean that you could have aircraft that were penetrating your defense zones. That's a classic case of an ARPA-hard problem that benefited from having program managers who were constructive contrarians, despite being told, \u201cIt just won't be aerodynamically feasible to design an aircraft with such a small cross section.\u201d An example of a project that isn't ARPA-hard: solving a problem that the commercial sector is going to solve in a year anyway, like a better camera for a cell phone. It's not clear that it's super risky because advances are happening in these commercial cameras all the time. The counterfactual, of the world in which an ARPA doesn't invest in that, is that ultimately those advances get made anyway. Faster-than-light travel. Maybe there are tachyons that are achieving faster-than-light speeds. But figuring out how to leverage that is probably beyond the risk tolerance of an ARPA program. What are you trying to do? How is it done today? What are the limits of current practice? What is new in your approach? And why do you think it will be successful? Who cares? What difference will it make? How much will it cost? How long will it take? What are the midterm and final exams to check for success, (which basically means: how do you evaluate that you're succeeding or failing)? Those questions are deceptively simple, but they help to guide one's approach to designing a program. So I love the ARPA model. I think it's a great alternative to a lot of traditional science and technology funding. There's also some blind spots. For instance, the Heilmeier questions don't have a question about counterfactual impact: \u201cWould this work get done otherwise?\u201d The office tends not to rigorously assess the other funding streams going to solve this particular problem, and their likelihoods of success. We also tend not to think much about strategic move and countermove. Particularly in national security, where different actors are competing against one another in technology, we probably should think more about baking security and safety into the technologies we create. For example, are there ways of making a technology less prone to reverse engineering, to theft, to misuse? Because many things that the U.S. government funds get stolen, even when we classify them. It probably is prudent to assign at least a 10% probability to some exquisite, classified technology being stolen. So you should think in advance: \u201cWill I be better or worse off having developed this technology if it's stolen?\u201d By making certain research programs known, you create a security dilemma: you prompt foreign intelligence services into thinking that you're planning to use some new offensive weapon. You need to be thoughtful about what information can be misinterpreted by others if they're aware of an investment. We also tend to overestimate our ability to keep secrets. In part, when you're operating in a classified environment, you're so aware of the protections: the guards, the guns, the gates, the special rooms with air gapping and no electronic devices. The environment creates so many inconveniences to go in and out, you assign a high level of confidence to it. But there are so many historical instances of our protections failing that we should be more realistic about the base rate of things getting stolen. That has implications for the research that we pursue and how we pursue it. For example, if you develop a technology that would actually create an asymmetric disadvantage if used against you. That strategic analysis isn't inherent in the DARPA Heilmeier questions or the ARPA Heilmeier questions. We continued to use the Heilmeier questions, but we wanted to get at how competitors are going to respond to a technology being developed. So we developed some additional questions: What's your estimate about how long it would take a major nation competitor to weaponize this technology after they learn about it? What's your estimate for a non-state terrorist group with resources like those of Al Qaeda in the first decade of the century? If the technology is leaked, stolen, or copied, would we regret having developed it? What first mover advantage is likely to endure after a competitor follows? How could the program be misinterpreted by foreign intelligence? Do you have any suggestions for reducing that risk? Can we develop defensive capabilities before or alongside offensive ones? Can the technology be made less prone to theft, replication, and mass production? What design features could create barriers to entry? What red team activities could help answer these questions? Whose red team opinions would you particularly respect? Red teaming is a really important check on the strategic value of a particular technology, and it's not done frequently enough. We typically start research programs in the ARPAs without having somebody assigned to thinking, \u201cImagine we're successful. What are you going to do in response to this technology that we've just created? How are you going to counter it?\u201d We don't do enough red teaming in general. Sometimes it's just awkward, because you're trying to beat the stuff that you're investing a lot of money and time to building. You're not highly motivated to see the ways that it breaks. There are institutional and even personal incentives not to explore the ways in which your own investment is potentially vulnerable. Also, it takes time and investment, and that trades off against efforts that are seen as more within the \u201cjob jar\u201d of an R&D agency. But in fact, it\u2019s one of our best ways of identifying vulnerabilities early and creating countermeasures. The ARPAs could say, \u201cIt\u2019s not our job to figure out how to break our own technology.\u201d But it's not clear any agency is better qualified. You need folks who are going to be sincere about trying to break it, who aren't friends with the program manager, who are sufficiently separated as honest brokers. Most ARPA programs will have testing and evaluation teams. Those roles are typically played by a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC), or a university-affiliated research center, which are able to leverage private sector expertise, but have reliable enough funding that they don't have to worry about irritating the government. They can just be trusted to tell the truth. They're also temperamentally selected to tell the truth even if it's unpopular. Places like RAND , IDA , the Center for Naval Analysis and others are magnets for nerds who are honest to a fault. The ARPAs then put the FFRDCs to work in evaluating whether the program is successful. They are typically not put to work on the other side, which is, \u201cNow pretend that you're our enemy and are figuring out how to counter this technology, or figure out how you're going to put it to use once you\u2019ve stolen it.\u201d I think the institutions already exist to carry out that work: they're just not typically asked to do it. Again, in the cyber realm, we have organizations that focus on red teaming and pentests , and there are competitions, like Defcon, in which that red team activity is celebrated. We don't do that as systematically in national security. There's no permanent red team at the (NSC) National Security Council that tries to anticipate how China will respond to a particular US action. It might be incredibly valuable for that to exist. What\u2019s the relationship between IARPA and the intelligence community like? So IARPA is similar to DARPA: it has the same overall model of program managers, programs run like research tournaments, and a rigorous process for stopping funding for things that aren't working. The main difference is that our end user is the intelligence community, which is a collection of 18 agencies that collect, analyze, interpret, and protect information for US decision makers. The goal of IARPA is to fund advanced research that ultimately improves decision advantage. The intelligence community is maybe 1/10th the size of the Defense Department. And because things don't need to be mass-produced, you don\u2019t need as many pieces of equipment for the intelligence community compared to the DoD, the problems that are worked on can be one-offs. You might just need to build a single device, or five of a device. Because there's often a greater premium on secrecy, there's more thinking about the security around technology efforts. In some cases, that includes preventing it from even being recognized as an area of research. The technology base is different for DARPA. There\u2019s a lot of established defense contractors. The intelligence community will often have contractors that are smaller and less well known for security reasons [ for more on these reasons, see IARPA: A Modified DARPA Innovation Model ] . All the program managers require a TSSCI clearance. That's not true of DARPA, where most of the program managers might have secret or top secret clearances. In some ways it can open it up because if you don't have to mass produce something, then the technical space of options offers more degrees of freedom. The problem of collection is typically in collecting electrons or photons, so those end up being physics and electrical engineering problems. There's also chemistry problems, since we're increasingly concerned about misuses of biology, so figuring out how to analyze chemical signatures of biological activity is important. And the analysis side certainly does involve things like statistics, computer science, and machine learning research. But ultimately, decision making is predominantly human, and the psychology of cognitive biases and heuristics is really important. There's been more room for investing in research, human judgment, and in cognitive psychology compared to the other ARPAs. Then there's the problem of information protection, and there it's back to physics and engineering problems. On the protection side, it's a cat and mouse game of trying to figure out how you would counter all of the clever things that you're doing to collect information. I became interested after reading the book Expert Political Judgment by Phil Tetlock, which is one of the more ambitious pieces of research on the accuracy of human judgment about policymaking. Part of the reason for working on those problems at IARPA was that they seemed neglected, relative to what the societal benefit could be for US decision making in national security and foreign policy. Over a 20-year period, Tetlock evaluated the accuracy of forecasts from a bunch of different participants about world events and found that the accuracy wasn't substantially better than random chance, in many cases. The decisions that humans make can be extraordinarily costly. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were multi-trillion dollar decisions. If you can improve the accuracy of forecasting individual strategies by just a percentage point, that would be worth tens of billions of dollars. Yet society does not invest tens of billions of dollars in figuring out how to improve the accuracy of human judgment. That seems really odd. You really can substantially improve human judgment through a few interventions that are pretty robust, over different cohorts of people, over different periods of time, over different kinds of analytic questions. I was lucky that I had great bosses. They weren\u2019t completely convinced that the methods were necessarily going to work, but they recognized the value of methods that would work and were willing to take the risk. The Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper , Robert Cardillo as Deputy for intelligence integration, and Stephanie Sullivan as Principal Deputy Director: the three of them supported and protected this research. We also took a particular approach: setting up a repeatable process to evaluate methods, rather than picking which horse was going to win in advance. That created an experimental test bed in which you could evaluate a bunch of different analytic methods for their accuracy, and some of them could be based on human judgment. Some of them can be based on machine learning. Some of them could be based on a combination. Then you could run them all in a forecasting tournament to see whether they're making accurate forecasts about real world events. The goal really was to create an observatory in which different kinds of methods could be compared to one another and tested for accuracy. Here\u2019s the math intuition: that if you think of a human judgment as (truth + random error + systematic bias), when you take the average of a bunch of human judgments, you're tending to cancel out the random error. And if those judgments are diverse, based on different sources of information and different mental models, that will tend to cancel out systematic bias, so your estimate is going to get closer to the truth. This goes all the way back to Francis Galton and his experiments of getting crowds to estimate the weight of an ox. The work that we did at IARPA in the ACE program and in forecasting tournaments that followed supported this notion. There is a way of improving on that: finding subsets of people who are consistently more accurate than others, \u201c superforecasters ,\u201d and then taking the average of their judgments. It's still, though, taking an average of relatively large numbers of judgments, as opposed to simply taking the super-duper-forecaster who's consistently #1. Methods of picking a single individual didn\u2019t perform well, even if it was cherry picking the single best individual for a particular field. That's an important insight into analytic accuracy that not many institutions have adopted. That's peculiar, because it's a research finding that's been pretty robust across different subjects, and many institutions should be highly motivated to increase their accuracy. I don't have good answers to that question. It's something that Robin Hanson has a pretty cynical hypothesis about; that the leaders of most institutions aren't primarily motivated by increasing accuracy, but are more motivated by protecting their own status, or those of senior leaders. Crowdsourcing is inherently disruptive to leadership. I think you're right. Institutions in general have reasons to be anxious about either threats to their credibility or their "

    "keywords": "There are many forces in policymaking (and in our lives generally) that push us towards the short term. Many of the most important measurements in political life are on extremely tight timelines: election cycles, monthly unemployment reports, even the President's daily intelligence briefing. The pressure to get results \u2014 and to show results \u2014 on a tight turnaround is incredible. One of my questions on Statecraft for a while has been: How do you build a machine to get long-term results? Whether it's a new agency or a new initiative, how do you set up a structure to work toward a goal that's 10, or 20, or 50 years away? And how do you protect that structure from short-term political pressures? Today's interviewee is Sir Rory Collins . Sir Rory has spent a full 20 years building and leading one of the most important scientific resources in the world: UK Biobank . The Biobank represents a fascinating case study in long-term thinking. It's a database of half a million British participants whose health is being tracked longitudinally for the next 30 years. The Biobank was established with the knowledge that the upfront work, and the spending required, would only really start to pay off 15 years later. When Sir Rory went in for the 10-year review with funders, they asked what had been achieved so far. He said, \u201cNothing.\u201d But today, UK Biobank is paying massive dividends: It's democratized access to population-scale data for researchers worldwide, and it's already yielding amazing insights into the causes of and cures for disease. I wanted to understand how he built UK Biobank, and, just as importantly, how he managed to sustain it over a long period of time. How to create long-term value in research How to recruit half a million research subjects Why the Biobank deferred so many decisions How other countries\u2019 prospective studies are learning from UK Biobank [Publication note: I refer to Collins several times as \u201cSir Collins.\u201d I have since been informed by editor Harry Fletcher-Wood that, as a knight, he is \u201cSir Rory\u201d (whereas, if he were a lord, it would be \u201cLord Collins\u201d). I regret the error. Fletcher-Wood\u2019s judicious edits to the audio and transcript, as well as his insight into British norms, are greatly appreciated.] For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: UK Biobank was set up at the beginning of the century. It initially came out of an idea from the Wellcome Trust charity, which funds a lot of medical research, and the Medical Research Council (MRC), our UK equivalent of the National Institutes of Health [ a US government agency funding health research ]. The concept, which I think came from a lot of epidemiologists, geneticists, and other health researchers, was to set up a large, what we call a prospective cohort [ which follows a group of people over time to see how their health develops ]. We recruited half a million men and women who were aged 40\u201369 between 2006 and 2010. They're from all across the United Kingdom, from different socioeconomic groups, urban, rural, etc., who came along, answered lots of questions about their lifestyle, environment, family, and their medical history. They agreed to provide us with biological samples and physical measurements and, importantly, to allow us to follow their health, which we've been doing over the last 20 years, largely through linkage to the National Health Service health record systems [ the national medical system, which all UK residents can access free ], but also going back to participants themselves and asking them about different aspects of their health. Talk to me about the scientific value of the Biobank. What have we learned so far? What are we hoping to learn in the future? The beauty of studying people in middle age, when they're relatively healthy, is you can find out about their exposures, not just their genetic makeup, but also the way in which they're living, and all the things that predate the development of disease. The big advantage of having studied them then, and then following their health, is we can understand the causal determinants of disease: Not only the genetics, but also lifestyle, environment, the proteins and metabolites in their blood, that subsequently lead to them developing some particular condition. The important thing that the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust required of us, when we set it up, was to make this data available to researchers around the world for any kind of health-related research that's in the public interest. And that's the consent that these half-million altruistic participants have agreed to. So the data is being used by scientists everywhere to try to understand, why is it that one person gets a particular disease and another doesn't? Is it their genetics? Is it their lifestyle? And what are the pathways through which genes, environment, and lifestyle might lead to getting a disease? There are thousands of researchers around the world working on the data. Last year alone, there were 5,000 peer-reviewed publications based on UK Biobank. It's unprecedented in terms of the scale of discovery and the range of discoveries that are emerging, all down to the altruism of those half-million participants. The decision to set up UK Biobank looks prescient now, but at the time it was a risky decision. The great thing about genetics is that your genes don't change. In some respects, the most efficient way of studying the genetic determinants of disease is to take people with a particular disease and compare them with those who don't, because the disease itself won't have changed your genetics. Therefore, you can see the differences in the genetics of someone who has a disease as compared with those who don't. That's how we've learned so much about genetic mutations that are strongly causal of disease. Epidemiology [ the study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why ] is much harder, because your lifestyle and environment is influenced by disease. You want to study people when they're healthy, find out how they're living, and then follow them for a long period of time to understand what led to disease. For example, you study people\u2019s smoking habits, follow them, and you find that smoking causes lung cancer, many other cancers, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, etc. One of the best ways to get people to stop smoking is for them to have a heart attack: then they stop smoking. They changed their environmental risk factor. There was a lot of controversy at the beginning of the century as to whether a study like UK Biobank was the right thing to do if you were interested in genetics alone. But we're not: we're interested in how genes and environment and lifestyle interact. For that, you need to set up a large, prospective study. Large, because you need enough people to develop any particular condition in order to be able to have the statistical power to determine the causal factors. Prospective, with long-term follow-up, so that you are actually studying the causal associations. So it required a kind of a vision of the importance, not just of genetics, but of all of the different drivers of disease, for the MRC and the Wellcome Trust to decide they were going to set this up, with a recognition that for the first 10 or even 15 years, it was unlikely that it would actually produce anything of material value in terms of discoveries. Now, of course, it's a gold mine. There are a number of epidemiologists who have been involved in setting up large prospective studies. The classic in Britain was the British Doctors study that studied doctors and their smoking habits and has followed them for half a century. So the ability to recruit large numbers of people is certainly there. But when one looked at the studies that had been done, they had largely looked at old risk factors: blood pressure, body mass index, obesity, or extreme thinness, cholesterol levels, where cholesterol had been measured, and the samples hadn't been stored. So a number of people, around the world, had seen the value in establishing a large prospective study with biological samples stored, and then just waiting until it was possible to assay those samples at that very large scale of hundreds of thousands of individuals, with markers that hadn't been studied so far. We knew how to recruit large numbers of people. In the UK, we had been running really quite large randomized trials, working with the National Health Service to recruit directly into studies. It seemed to us that one could take that approach of working with the NHS to invite people to join the study. And then, when they agreed to take part, to look at how one could build a factory production line, where they would go through answering lots of questions. We used touchscreen technology, which was relatively novel at that time, to get lots of questions answered. [ We had ] people moving through this production line of answering questions, having physical measurements, and collecting biological samples. If you invited enough people and you had enough funding, then you really could recruit very large numbers, which is what we did. There had been a number of long-term observational studies of things like blood pressure, blood cholesterol, body mass index, with tens of thousands [ of participants ]. Perhaps the biggest was the MRFIT screening study in the US of a third of a million American men, which showed this very lovely association between cholesterol level and the risk of coronary artery disease. It showed that throughout the range, higher cholesterol was associated with higher risk, and there really was no normal level whereby lower cholesterol was not likely to be cardioprotective. These very large prospective studies, either individually or collectively through a meta-analysis, a combination of the results from different studies, showed that if you had hundreds of thousands of people in prospective studies, either individual [ studies ] or combined, then you could get very clear signals about the strength of the relationship of the risk factors that have been measured and disease. That generated the hypothesis that if we could create studies of hundreds of thousands of people, then we would be able to study many more risk factors, if we stored the samples and then just waited until we could analyze them at scale. I know that a number of individual researchers put in grant applications that were not supported. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon set up a study of the dietary determinants of cancer, where they collected biological samples, but it was really a study of studies. They did a study in each country and then IARC brought those together. They were all slightly different, but it did produce a large-scale prospective study. But these were seen as studies that were of value for non-genetic risk factors. When UK Biobank was being proposed by the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust, I think that one of the drivers for it was the opportunity to study the genetic determinants of disease. Quite rightly, people said, \u201cIf you're interested in genetic determinants of disease, you can get quick answers relatively cost-effectively by just studying people with disease and people without.\u201d I think the messaging didn't really get across clearly enough that one wasn't interested solely in genetics, one was interested in all of the different risk factors: genetics, environmental, lifestyle. The beauty [ in having all three ] is that one can actually unpick the causal aspects of environmental and lifestyle risk factors. With Mendelian randomization , you use genetic changes in, say, body mass index to determine whether body mass index is actually causally related to disease. Having all of these things in one study is incredibly powerful, not only for determining the strength of an association, but determining its causal nature. I wasn't seriously involved in it until around 2005. The decision was made by the Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust that they wanted to fund a large prospective study. It really came from within those organizations and it's quite difficult to understand exactly why those decisions were made. I think partly they were a result of epidemiologists having argued the case for the value of large prospective studies that could study newer risk factors and the value of having much bigger studies than we'd had before. I think part of it was the excitement about the ability to study genetics at scale. These came together, in my view, to help the funders decide that they wanted to set up a large prospective study that would be able to look at the genetic determinants of risk, but also to look at those in the context of lifestyle and environment. So they made an internal decision to fund this study. They set up a small group led by Tom Meade , an epidemiologist, to get input from scientists around the UK and beyond around what the scale of that study should be. They looked at power calculations to decide what sort of differences in risk could be detected with studies of 100,000, 200,000. They came up with half a million individuals. The age range was selected on the basis of: young enough that you would be studying people before disease changed the risk factors, but old enough that the study would start to produce results within 10-15 years. So there was always an expectation that this was a long-term commitment. I think only organizations like the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust could make a decision whereby the first 10 years are really just waiting. But I don't think they, or indeed any of us, thought it would become as productive as it has been. The reason it has is access. One of the things that the Wellcome Trust and the MRC decided at the very beginning was that this was not a resource that was being produced by researchers for themselves alone. This was going to be made available as widely as possible, in order that both the financial and the altruistic investment of the participants generated as much knowledge about how to prevent and treat disease as possible. That, I think, has been the transformative aspect of UK Biobank: the model of accessibility. There was quite a lot of uncertainty about the quality of findings that would emerge if you just made data accessible to researchers around the world. There was also uncertainty about what kind of capacity there would be to turn the samples into data. To give you a sense of that, when it was decided to move forward, it was set up with half a million samples, and the idea was to collect them in multiple different tubes and sub-aliquot them [to divide the samples into additional sub-samples which can be used by different researchers ]. In order to retrieve particular samples from particular individuals, it was decided to build an automated archive which was state-of-the-art, to keep the samples at -80 [ Celsius; -112 Fahrenheit ], but be able to track them, and retrieve them when you wanted to. That archive was built with a single robot, because it was expected that one would pull out samples from, say, 10,000 women who developed breast cancer after 10 years, and 10,000 controls to compare the people who do and don't develop a particular cancer. This is a case-control approach. If what you're interested in is studying a particular disease, that is very cost effective because instead of analyzing all half a million people, you measure the people with the disease you're interested in and some matched controls. But, after we had recruited all the participants, and we were discussing this with our science advisory board, they said, \"If you're trying to build a resource for researchers around the world to use for all kinds of different research, then a strategy where you assay the samples [ test them for substances or biological markers ] as if you're doing it for a single researcher isn't actually the best approach. The thing to do is to wait until you can assay all of the samples for some particular type of assay.\u201d So, until you can genotype the whole cohort [ profile each individual\u2019s DNA ] leave [ the ] samples alone. Until people have developed disease, during the first 10 years when they're relatively healthy, there is no value in assaying the samples. Our watchword was defer: don't do anything now that you could do better later. Rather than doing case-control, better to wait until you can genotype the whole cohort. That turned [ the Biobank, rather than being ] a star study of a particular disease, into a resource for researchers to do all kinds of different research. They say that the definition of an intelligent man or woman is one who can hold two opposing views at the same time, don't they? In a way, that was the situation. I think we all want quick wins. But we know there are no quick wins in a prospective study. So it was really just reinforcing the messaging. Every five years the funders say, \u201dWhat have you done?\u201d The first 10 years, we were building, recruiting, and then starting to turn samples into data. We were linking people to their health records, but it was a very slow buildup of use of the resource. At the ten-year review, I was asked, \u201cWhat had UK Biobank done, for which it was set up?\u201d It was a one-word answer: \u201cNothing.\u201d There was a quiet pause at that point, but that was the truth. It was a resource that was in gestation. I went on to say that it will be the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years where it really starts to deliver on the investment that has been made. The thing that transformed UK Biobank from a UK to an international study was when the UK government offered some funding to get the genotyping done. Affymetrix in California won the tender. We were able to tell researchers that there was genotyping data available on half a million participants. That's where we were moving to a scale that had never been done before. Researchers had been combining studies of a few hundred or a few thousand people to try to understand the genetic determinants of, say, blood pressure or height or cardiovascular disease. Here [ we were ] now with genotyping data on half a million people. That was what put Biobank on the researchers\u2019 map and we started to see an increase in use of the resource internationally, particularly in North America and mainland Europe. Before anything happened, the Wellcome Trust and MRC did a widespread consultation with the research community about the things that people wanted to study. A lot of different working groups were set up to determine what questions or measurements one would make to be able to understand, say diet or activity. There were a whole set of pilot studies done by researchers to look at how you collect and assay samples in the future. So, how would you collect and process a sample so that when the technology caught up, and you could do that at the scale of half a million people, your sample would be the right kind? There was a lot of consultation with patient groups around issues like feedback. In UK Biobank, there is a policy of not feeding back information to participants [ about what assays of their samples reveal ]. That was something that went through a lot of iterations because you imagine [ participants thinking ], you want me to join a study, you're going to make all these measurements, why aren't you going to tell me what those measurements are? Then you go, \"We don't know what these measurements mean. Do you still want us to tell you what they are, when they may or may not be relevant to your disease?\u201d They may be misleading, for example. Even things like single-gene disorders [ diseases caused by a single gene ] that are found in a population may have quite different relevance in a free-living population [ who aren\u2019t suffering particular diseases and are not part of specific medical studies ]. They may be much less predictive of disease and we don't know thes"

But for good governance advocates, it\u2019s long been a touchpoint for its \u201ce-government\u201d model. The New Yorker wrote in 2017 that, \u201capart from transfers of physical property, such as buying a house, all bureaucratic processes can be done online.\u201d Wired called Estonia \u201cthe world's most digitally advanced society.\u201d On its \u201ce-Estonia\u201d site , the country itself brags, in a mod font, \u201cWe have built a digital society, and we can show you how.\u201d The Estonian model has a lot going for it from the perspective of a citizen. For example: Taxes take a few minutes to file, you can see every time the government looks at your data, and you never have to give the government a piece of information more than once. And it makes governance easier: the bureaucracy is leaner, information is shared across agencies, and data is more secure. But how much of this model could be adopted here in the US, or in the rest of the West? And how much is reliant on a cultural and societal context we just don\u2019t have here? To get answers, I talked to Joel Burke , author of the new book Rebooting a Nation: The Incredible Rise of Estonia, E-Government and the Startup Revolution . Joel is an American who worked with the Estonian government, and I learned a lot from his book. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: If we roll back the clock to \u201991, things were tough but hopeful. Estonia had been occupied for several decades by the Soviet Union, and had a long history of occupation by various regional powers. The country was facing an economic conundrum. The Soviets were not that great at capitalism, and the factories and institutions they built were inefficient. Like every country that achieved independence from the Soviet Union, Estonia had to deal with economic reform. And Estonia decided to fully embrace the market economy. Mart Laar , who became Prime Minister, basically did economic shock therapy for the country, removing subsidies and the like. It was very aggressive. A couple things set Estonia on a good trajectory. In many other post-Soviet places, factory operations were entrusted to their managers, with the intuitive idea that the people who had been running them knew best. But running a factory in the Soviet Union was a very political job and not focused on managerial efficiency. Estonia instead focused on finding foreign partners who could help reform these factories, make them more efficient, and co-invest. When they found that foreign direct investment, they tried to direct it toward digitizing their systems. Not digital as we think of it today \u2014 this was the early \u201990s, we\u2019re not talking about smartphones \u2014 but modernizing the underlying systems. This was most obvious in the banking sector. Many of the banks, even today, are from Sweden and other countries in the region. A big part of how they helped build the e-state was investing in online banking, which ended up fomenting the country\u2019s digitization and adoption of technology. I\u2019d say it\u2019s what\u2019s across the water \u2014 it\u2019s Finland. Estonia is a short way away across a body of water from Helsinki. When Finland transmitted radio and TV waves, they were strong enough to reach from Helsinki to much of Estonia, including the capital. That meant that, unlike many of the nations cut off behind the Iron Curtain, Estonia still got exposure to the West, to a capitalist society a short distance away. You would read advertisements for grocery stores that were full of meat at a time when there were bread lines. Former President Ilves talks about watching reruns of Dallas and Dynasty and these \u201970s and \u201980s TV shows that were broadcast in English in Finland. The other reason I mention Finland is, if we roll back the clock even further to just before Estonia was occupied in World War II, Estonia had about the same standard of living as Finland. Then after five decades of Soviet occupation, as you can imagine, Estonia far lags its neighbor in any calculation of wealth or wellness. So there was this sense of collegial rivalry or competitiveness, where Estonia and Finland were always each other\u2019s measuring sticks. Or at least for Estonia, Finland was. After receiving independence, Estonia saw that Finland was way ahead. It became clear that if they just followed the traditional development methods, they\u2019d never be able to catch up. So they had to pursue a really radical agenda. And I think Estonians were bought into this idea of trying to leap across the chasm to make better lives for themselves, and both that popular support and the boldness of leaders allowed for really aggressive reform. One of my former colleagues, Adam Rang , was just talking about this. It does seem that Estonia is somewhat finding its groove; it\u2019s no longer trying to be the Silicon Valley of Europe, or part of the Nordic nations. It\u2019s like, \u201cNo, we\u2019re Estonia, and we matter on our own.\u201d But when I worked for the Estonian government and led business development for the e-Residency program , it was definitely a key talking point we were supposed to get across. \u201cNo, no, Estonia is not Baltic. It\u2019s Nordic.\u201d I think this is emblematic of principles that have become endemic to Estonian society, especially around the civil service and politics and startup culture \u2014 and there's a lot of mixing between those worlds. This idea of not purchasing or using legacy equipment was really important. It originated with either Sweden or Finland, which were major supporters of Estonia after independence, when the country desperately needed help. One of them offered to revamp the phone system in Tallinn. There was a choice between taking this free thing that\u2019s old while this other country upgrades to a new system, or making sacrifices and building our own solutions and leapfrogging . Estonia chose the latter. The country couldn\u2019t just adopt the common model and grow slowly and work its way up the value chain. That doesn\u2019t work for a country like Estonia, which is 1.3 million people and has no natural resources. It has to do really bold things. This led to a realization that was maybe quite apparent at the time \u2014 if Estonia went to Microsoft or Oracle to get a quote for something, they actually couldn\u2019t afford the big Western companies. They would have charged $20 million. This fomented a culture of domestic public-private partnerships to develop much of what would become the e-government digital infrastructure. The e-IDs , for instance, were built with a consortium of the local banks to help facilitate access to online banking. Basically every e-service is built in partnership with a local tech company. That was initially a deliberate strategy to keep costs down, which came with the added benefit of helping to build up a domestic tech industry. That has turned into an export engine \u2014 and frankly, a branding engine \u2014 for the country. In 1994 there was the \u201c bloody autumn ,\u201d which was turf wars between gangs across the former Soviet Union. Estonia\u2019s privileged trade position was part of the reason for its repeated occupation, and it had been part of the Hanseatic League long ago. If you've achieved re-independence after years of fighting for it and you're now in charge of your own destiny, you don\u2019t want to fall into the trap of corruption. But if you don\u2019t have the literal manpower to actually staff the system, what do you do? Estonia decided to bet on digitization. Former President Ilves has a great quote: \u201cYou can\u2019t bribe a computer.\u201d That\u2019s catching on elsewhere \u2014 one of Ukraine\u2019s first big e-government projects was Prozorro open contracting, which has been held up as a gold standard. Government procurement contracts are a prime vector for corruption, so Prozorro puts things out in the daylight and digitizes them to protect the process. If you apply for a construction contract, you won\u2019t have someone showing up at your house saying, \u201cWe can expedite this for a tip.\u201d Instead, it goes through a standard digitized workflow and everyone can see who checked it. Estonia is now making a big bet on AI too. If you're Poland or Ukraine, you're going to matter simply on the basis of your population and size. Without that, Estonia needed to find other ways to compete and make itself into an interesting market or have any meaningful impact on the global stage. Technology became that dual tool: a way to prevent corruption, and a way to compensate for a missing workforce while also solving pressing problems. Digital identity is how you verify who you are and authenticate that identity. Taxes are a classic example. I\u2019m still mentally scarred from doing my US taxes a month ago. [ NB: Last month, we spoke to Deputy Treasury Wally Adeyemo about efforts to improve the US tax filing process.] In Estonia, you go to the government website, which has many services, including the tax portal. When you land on the login page, you insert your digital ID card into a card reader connected to your computer and it prompts you for your identity code and an authentication PIN. This e-ID serves as the authenticator that lets individuals securely interact with the system, whether to access government services or add a digital signature. You can think of this as a much more secure version of using your email and a password, which were probably pwned long ago. On the other side, you\u2019ve got the X-Road, which is the data layer that underpins it all and allows for distributed data exchange. Estonia honors the once-only principle : if you\u2019ve submitted your home address to one government agency, another agency shouldn\u2019t have to ask you for it again. X-Road lets agencies share that information. I should also mention for your more technical audience that it\u2019s now maintained by an open consortium, so other countries can explore and adopt it. If you want to go talk to the engineers, play with the code, and figure out how to build on it, you can. These are the foundations of Estonia\u2019s e-government and digital society, but I don\u2019t think any other country should adopt the exact technologies or techniques Estonia used wholesale. Estonia should be looked to for its foundational lessons. When I worked for the Estonian government, I was sometimes brought out to speak with visiting American delegations. One common question was, \u201cCan we just take Estonia in a box and copy it?\u201d That doesn\u2019t really work, nor should it. I\u2019m pretty skeptical that the US can implement digital identity at the federal level, given that REAL ID has taken 15 years just to update our driver\u2019s licenses. But because we all have phones and most of them have biometric data, I do think we might see an interesting public-private partnership emerge to verify identity and link it to documents using Facebook or whatever. I think the once-only principle is emblematic. Just imagine moving homes. Maybe you need to file your taxes, or your child needs to change schools. Instead of going through the slog of submitting the same information to multiple parties and maybe forgetting one, resulting in a letter being sent to your old address, or even moving countries and losing touch entirely, the system handles that. It sounds small, but these little things add up. X-Road enables seamless data sharing between agencies. Some listeners might be screaming about privacy concerns here. Estonia\u2019s system actually lets you look at all of the information the government has about you. For example, the government portal has a digital health record system. When I go to a doctor and they add a note or upload a lab result, I can log in and see exactly who has accessed my health records. If I notice that someone I didn\u2019t authorize has viewed my data, outside of a few national security exceptions, I can demand that information from the government. The system enables transparency. It might not be directly privacy-preserving, but it creates an environment that facilitates it. Compare that to the US with its caves and warehouses of paperwork. Most of us have no idea what information the government has about us, who\u2019s accessed it, or how to find out. Maybe I could file a FOIA request, but I'm not even sure who I would send that to. That\u2019s a crazy amount of work to put on an average citizen. In Estonia, the technical systems and strong rule-of-law culture enable a more accountable government. In the current US model, I have no idea who in the federal government is poking around in my records, and there aren\u2019t any checks on it that are visible to me. You can make privacy arguments in both directions. I touched on this earlier, but a critical piece of this is that Estonia has a strong rule of law and low corruption. If you demand to know who accessed your data, the government will tell you, and you can trust that the data won\u2019t be misused. I\u2019d be much more concerned about centralizing large amounts of data in a country that didn\u2019t have strong legal safeguards or real checks and balances. But Estonia has that rule of law and a strong press. One of the advantages of being a country of 1.3 million people is local accountability. Maybe your parents went to school with the president, so they can message them on Facebook. Nothing grounds a person more than a message from an old teacher or favorite professor saying, \u201cI don\u2019t really like that thing you did.\u201d It\u2019s a much flatter hierarchy. At the government level, it's about efficiency. There are two sides to that coin: government time savings and citizen time savings. People can focus on things that are more worthwhile and productive. Not to put it in blunt economic terms, but it helps save money and grow the economy. On the more individual side, take taxes, for example. Before I moved to Estonia, I was running a company in Germany for Rocket Internet , a private equity venture builder. I had filed taxes in the US, Germany, and Estonia in pretty quick succession. In Estonia, I simply went to the website, popped in my card, signed in, and everything was pre-populated. The government already knew how much I owed. I could review it and change a few fields if necessary, then press accept. It took roughly five minutes. I was a foreigner and it was my first time doing it: if I were more familiar with the system and tried to speed-run it, I could\u2019ve done it even faster. Now compare that to Germany, where you don\u2019t even try to do your taxes yourself. That\u2019s just not something a foreigner, and in some cases even a local, would do. I paid a Steuerberater , a tax lawyer, several thousand dollars. And then in the US, you have the privilege of paying a private company at least $100, if not more, to give the government information that it already has. And that\u2019s just one example. Think of every interaction you have with the government and imagine how a private company focused on maximizing efficiency or well-being would do it. I\u2019m not saying Estonia\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s not. But there\u2019s a customer-centric mindset that makes the government work for people instead of putting up barriers or using process as means-testing. In the book, you compare having a newborn in the US and getting that set of paperwork to having a newborn in Estonia. Will you share that example? Let me caveat that this is research-driven \u2014 I haven\u2019t had a kid in either place yet, so I don\u2019t have personal experience. In the US, you show up at the hospital with private insurance, or maybe you're on a public program like WIC . There are also many state and local programs that may or may not be relevant to your taxes and benefits, and you might not even know about them. When you have your child, maybe the hospital helps you with the registration. Then you receive a physical Social Security card and a birth certificate, which you might stash in a fireproof safe or bank deposit box. In Estonia, you show up at the hospital, and after the baby is born, they get tagged to the parents\u2019 digital identity. That sounds a bit funny, but that\u2019s essentially what happens. Because the system has your information, if this is your third or fourth child, it triggers a tax benefit \u2014 Estonia, like many European countries, is dealing with low birth rates, so they\u2019re trying to incentivize families to have more kids. Instead of you having to figure out which programs exist and how to apply for them, they just proactively sign you up, or send a message to check if you want this. There's no silver bullet here. but there are a few important factors I want to touch on. First is timing . Estonia achieved independence at the dawn of the modern web, at least in a more commercial sense. And had the wherewithal to identify that trend and build on it. If it had been 20 years earlier, I don't know that they could have made the same bets. They might have ended up with an entirely different system. If you\u2019re thinking about digitizing your country today, like the US is, you should not copy Estonia\u2019s strategy, which used \u201890s technology. You should be thinking about how to use AI to reform systems. Another element is culture . Estonia has created a civil service culture that rewards innovation. That\u2019s exemplified by programs like Accelerate Estonia , which has a tagline of \u201cMaking illegal things legal.\u201d The program solicits ideas for public good from private citizens and folks in the public sector and works to change the legal framework and partner with entrepreneurs to implement the proposals. And the people who helped build this program are lauded for it. One of the founders is now ambassador to the UK, which is a critical partner for Estonia. Folks like Siim Sikkut , the former CIO of Estonia, now runs Digital Nation and helps other countries build these systems. In the US, we say that we want public servants to be more innovative, but having been on the congressional side, that\u2019s not how things actually go. Say someone on the DoD procurement team does the right thing and says, \u201cInstead of going with Lockheed Martin, we\u2019re going to choose an unproven startup that has this amazing capability and give them a $500 million contract.\u201d If that project goes belly up, there will be congressional hearings and people screaming about government waste. So instead of being applauded for trying something innovative, they\u2019ll get yelled at. That incentivizes people to keep their heads down and just move up the ladder in a seniority-based institution. I also think that we\u2019re victims of our own success . Ditto for Germany and Japan, which are successful nations with crazy bureaucracies. The amount of paperwork you have to do in these places is absurd. But wealthy nations can paper over these problems, literally. We get trapped by not wanting to change the systems that led to our success \u2014 you don\u2019t want to disrupt your own business. In the book, I use the example of the Macy\u2019s dilemma; they were a successful big-box retailer, synonymous with upscale fashion, and had the Macy\u2019s Day Parade, but Macy\u2019s is a shell of its former self because of fast fashion, Amazon, and all of the converging trends. I can sympathize with the executive team there at the dawn of Amazon. Do you blow up your business and bet on the web at a time when you don\u2019t yet know if it will be successful? That's kind of a crazy thing to ask. That\u2019s even harder to do at the national level where politicians are on two, four, or six-year cycles. In a wealthy country with a high quality of life like the US, that's tough to do. You\u2019ve made clear that you can't just port over the Estonian model to the US. There are some obvious reasons for that, like scale and timing. Is federalism is another reason? We have 50 states, almost all of which are larger entities than Estonia itself. And then there\u2019s a folk libertarianism and a distrust of centralized power in the US that I think is both a strength and weakness for us. Given all of that, which parts of the Estonian model would be productive for American lawmakers and public sector servants"

I'm the author of a book called In This Economy and an economic commentator. Santi: Kyla has joined me today for a couple reasons. One, I'm a big fan of her newsletter : it's about economics, among many other things. She had a great piece recently on what we can learn from C.S. Lewis\u2019s The Screwtape Letters , which is a favorite book of mine. Kyla\u2019s also on today because we're interviewing Wally Adeyemo, who was the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in the Biden administration. We figured we each had questions we wanted answered. Kyla: Yeah, I've had the opportunity to interview Wally a couple times during the Biden administration, and I wanted to see where he thinks things are at now. He played a key role in implementing the Inflation Reduction Act, financial sanctions on Russia , and a whole bunch of other things. Santi: For my part, I'm stuck on Wally's role in setting up the IRS\u2019s Direct File program , where you can file your taxes for free directly through the IRS instead of paying TurboTax a hundred bucks to do it. \u201cGood governance types\u201d tend to love Direct File, but the current admin is thinking of killing it. I wanted to understand how the program got rolled out, how Wally would respond to criticisms of the program, and what he learned from building something in government, which now may disappear. Kyla, you've talked to Wally before. How did that conversation go? Kyla: I actually was able to go to his office in D.C., and I talked to a couple of key people in the Biden administration: Jared Bernstein , the former chair of the CEA, and Daniel Hornung , who was at the National Economic Council. We're talking to Wally on the day that the House passed the one big beautiful bill . There's also so much happening financially, like the bond market is totally rebelling against the US government right now. I'm really curious how he thinks things are, as a key player in the last administration. Subscribe to Statecraft Subscribe to Kyla's Newsletter For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Santi: Wally, you've spent most of your career in Democratic Party institutions. You worked on the Kerry presidential campaign in 2004. You served in the Obama admin. You were the first chief of staff to the CFPB , the president of the Obama Foundation, and, most recently, Deputy Treasury Secretary in the Biden admin. 30,000ft question: How do you see the Democratic Party today? My view is that we continue to be the party that cares deeply about working-class people, but we haven't done a good job of communicating that to people, especially when it comes to the things that matter most to them. From my standpoint, it's costs: things in America cost too much for a working-class family. I want to make sure I define working class: I think about people who make under $100,000 a year, many of whom don't own homes on the coast or don\u2019t own a significant amount of stocks (which means they haven't seen the asset appreciation that's led to a great deal of wealth creation over the last several decades). When you define it that way, 81% of Americans sit in that category of people. Despite the fact that they've seen their median incomes rise 5-10% over the last five years, they've seen the cost of the things they care about rise even faster. We haven't had a clear-cut agenda focused on the standard of living, which I think is the thing that matters most to Americans today. Santi: There are folks who would say the problem for Democrats wasn't that they couldn't communicate clearly, or that they didn't have a governing agenda, but that they couldn't execute their agenda the way they hoped to in the time available to them. Would you say there's truth to that claim? Most people talk about a communications issue, but I don't think it's a communications issue. There are two issues. One is an implementation issue, and the second is an issue of the actual substance and policy at the Treasury Department. I was the deputy secretary, but I was also the Chief Operating Officer, which meant that I was in charge of execution. The two most significant domestic things I had to execute were the American Rescue Plan , where $1.9 trillion flowed through the Treasury Department, and the Inflation Reduction Act . The challenge with execution in the government is that we don't spend a lot on our systems, on making execution as easy as possible. For example, the Advanced Child Tax Credit was intended to give people money to help with each of their children during the pandemic. What Congress called on us to do was to pay people on a monthly basis. In the IRS system, you pay your taxes mostly on an annual basis, which meant that most of our systems weren't set up to pay a monthly check to Americans. It took us a great deal of work to figure out a way to recreate a system just to do that. We've underinvested in the systems that the IRS works on. The last time we made a significant investment in the IRS's digital infrastructure was the 1960s; before we had an ATM machine, before we sent a man to the moon, before we had a personal computer. So that meant that everything was coded in a language called COBOL . So execution was quite hard in the American Rescue Plan. People were left out and felt that the government wasn\u2019t working for them. If you called the IRS, only 13% of your calls were being answered. We got that back up to 85% before we left. Ultimately, I think part of this is an execution challenge. In government we want to spend money coming up with new policies, but we don't want to pay for execution, which then means that when you get the policy passed, implementation isn't great. When Jen Pahlka was on your show, she talked about the need to focus on identifying the enablers to implementation. Direct File was one of the best examples of us taking implementation very seriously. But also, on some policy issues that mattered most to Americans, we weren't advancing the types of strategies that would've helped lower the cost of housing and lowering the cost of medicine. We did some things there, but there's clearly more that we could have done, and more we need to do going forward to demonstrate that we're fighting to bring down those costs. It's everything from permitting reform \u2014 not just at the federal level, but what can we do to incentivize it at the state and local level \u2014 to thinking about what we can do on drug costs. Why does it cost so much more to get a medicine in America than in Canada? That is something that we can solve. We\u2019ve just chosen not to at the federal level. At the end of the year, we were going to take action to go after some of the middlemen in the pharmacy industry who were taking out rents and large amounts of money. It dropped out of the bill because of the negotiations between the Republican Congress and then President-elect Trump. But there are a lot of things that we can do both on implementation, which will mean that Americans feel the programs that we're passing in a more effective way, and policy solutions that we need to advance as a party that will help us as well. Kyla: Some people think Americans tend to vote against their own self-interest. How can your party message to people that these sorts of policies are really important for them? Ultimately, what I found is that most people just understand their self-interest differently, and for them, a big part of this was, \u201cWho's fighting for me on the issues that I care most about?\u201d From my standpoint, part of the problem we had with Direct File, which I think was an innovative solution, was that we got to implementing it so late in the administration that we didn't have the ability for it to show the impact. I'm hoping future administrations will think through how to start their implementation journey on things like Direct File sooner in the administration, when you have a great deal of political capital, so people can actually feel the impact over time. To your question, it\u2019s not just about the messaging, it's about the messenger . People tend to trust people who look like them, who come from the places they come from. When it came to the Child Tax Credit and also to Direct File, the biggest innovation wasn't the technology: the technology for Direct File has been used by the Australians, the British, and other countries for decades. The biggest innovation was us joining that technology with trusted people in communities who were going out to talk to people about those programs and building those relationships. That was something that the IRS hadn't done a great deal of. We invested a great deal in those community navigators who were helping us get people to trust the things the government was doing again, like the Child Tax Credit, like Direct File, so that they could use it. We often think that Washington is going to be able to give messages to the country that people are going to hear. But we're both in a more complicated media environment, where people are far more skeptical of things that come from people in Washington. So the best people to advocate for and celebrate the things that we're doing are people who are closer to the communities we're trying to reach. In product advertising today, more companies are looking to influencers to advertise things, rather than putting an ad on television, because people trust the people that they follow. The same is true for the things that we do in government. Santi: I\u2019ve talked to colleagues of yours in the last administration who say things like, \u201cIn the White House, we did not have a good enough sense of the shot clock.\u201d They point to various reasons, including COVID, as a reason the admin didn't do a good enough job of prioritization. Do you think that's true, that across the administration, there was a missing sense of the shot clock or a missing sense of prioritization? No, because I'm a Lakers fan. These are professionals. We're professionals. This is not our first rodeo. We know how much time is on the shot clock; we played this game. The challenge wasn't just COVID. For me at Treasury \u2014 and I think this is the coolest part of being Deputy Secretary of the Treasury \u2014 I had responsibilities domestic and international. As I'm trying to modernize the IRS, to invest all my time in making the system work better for customers and to collect more taxes from the people who owe money, Russia invades Ukraine. I had to turn a bunch of my attention to thinking about what we were going to do there. Then you have Hamas attacking Israel. There was more we should have done on the domestic end, but we have to remember that part of the presidency is: you get to do the things you want to do, but you also have to do the things you have to do. We had a lot of things we had to do that we weren't planning for which required all-of-the-administration responses. I think the most important lesson I've learned about that is that it comes down to both being focused on the things that matter, and being willing to communicate to the American people why your priorities have to change in light of things that happen in the world. But the people I'm sure you've talked to, most of them work on domestic policy alone, and they probably never have been in a National Security Council meeting, where you're thinking about the risks to the country. The president has to do both of those things. So I get how difficult it is to do that, just given where I sat at the Treasury Department. Santi: Looking back from an implementation perspective, are there things you would've done differently during your time at Treasury? The most important thing that I would've done differently was to immediately set up a permanent implementation and delivery unit in the Treasury Department. We always like to pretend like the Treasury Department is just a policy department where we make policy, we collect taxes. But in any crisis the country ever has, a great deal of responsibility \u2014 for execution or implementation of whatever the response is \u2014 falls to the Treasury Department. Think about the financial crisis, which is clearly something that's in the Treasury's domain. The vast majority of money for COVID flowed through the Treasury Department. You think about the IRA, a climate bill: the vast majority of that money flows through the Treasury Department. And Treasury doesn't have a dedicated staff that's just focused on implementation: How do we do this well? How do we make sure the right people are served? How do we make sure that we communicate this well? We did this to a degree by a team that was focused on the American Rescue Plan. But it was only focused on the American Rescue Plan. If I could start again, I would have said, \u201cI want a permanent implementation structure within the Treasury Department of people who are cross-cutting, who only think about how we execute the policies that we pass through Congress and that we put together through an executive order. How do we do that extremely well?\u201d Kyla: What you're talking about is very people-centric: How do we get an implementation team, and how do we make sure that the right people are doing the right jobs? Now we have DOGE, which is less people-centric. How do you reconcile what Doge is doing relative to what you would've done differently in this role that you had? As you would suspect, I wasn't excited about the fact we had lost the election, but initially I thought DOGE could be helpful with technology. I think marrying technology with people \u2014 that's the key to success for the government. We've never really been great at doing technology in the government. Part of the reason for that is a procurement process that is very slow because of how the federal acquisition rules work. What we are trying to do is prevent corruption and also waste, fraud, and abuse. But what that does is, it leads to slowness in our ability to get the technology on board that we need, and in getting the right people. I was hoping DOGE would bring in people who knew a great deal about technology and put us in a position where we could use that to build better products for the American people. I thought they would love Direct File, and that they would find ways to improve Direct File and expand it to more Americans. My view is that any American in the working class or middle class should not have to pay a company to file their taxes. We have the ability in this country, and I think Direct File was proving that. My goal, if we\u2019d had more time, was to expand this to almost any American being able to use it. I thought they'd be able to accelerate that by bringing in the right people, but also the right technology. We were on that path before they took those two things apart. My sense is that you have to reform the way that we hire people because it's too hard to hire the right people. In some cases, you don't need some of the people you have today because technology is going to require different skills to do different things. It's easier to break something, I found, than it is to build something. I think that's what they're finding today as well. Santi: When I talk to left-of-center folks about the DOGE push, they tend to be skeptical about the idea that AI or modern technology can replace existing federal workers. I think some of that is a natural backlash to the extreme partisan coding of DOGE, and the fact that they\u2019re firing a lot of people very quickly. But what's your view? After DOGE, what kinds of roles would you like to see automated? Let me say: I disagree with the view that DOGE and technology can\u2019t replace some of the things that federal workers do today. My view is that \u201cproductivity enhancing\u201d tech \u2014 it's not that it is going to make employees who are currently doing the job more productive. It is going to mean you need fewer employees. We have to be honest about that. Go to the IRS, for example. When I got there, we had a huge paper backlog at the IRS because, despite what most people think, millions of people still file their taxes by paper, and they send them to the IRS. And during the pandemic, the commissioner, who was then working for President Trump, decided to shut down the IRS for public health reasons \u2014 to make sure employees did not have to risk getting COVID. There were piles of paper backing up, so much so that they had filled cafeterias at the IRS facilities with huge piles of paper. The problem, of course, is that, unlike modern systems, you could not just machine-read those papers and put them into our systems. Much of that required humans to code those papers into the system by hand. There is no need in the 21st century for that to happen, so one of the things that we started to do was introduce this simple thing called scanning, where you would scan the papers \u2014 I know it sounds like a novel idea. That would help you get people\u2019s tax returns faster into the system, but also get checks out quickly, and allow us to see if people are underpaying their taxes, because we can use that data with a modern system. But over time, what would that mean? We\u2019d need fewer people to enter the data from those forms. When we get money for the IRS from Congress, it is actually seen as revenue-raising because they expect it to bring down the debt and deficit, which is completely true. But the model Congress uses to do that is reliant on the number of full-time employees we hire. One challenge we have with the IRS \u2014 and in government systems in general \u2014 is that you don't get credit for technology investments that should improve your return on investment. So whenever we did the ROI calculations for the IRS, the Congressional Budget Office would calculate how much revenue we'd bring in, and it was always based on the number of people you had doing enforcement work that would lead to certain dollars coming in. So we got no credit for the technology investments. Which was absolutely the opposite of what we knew would be true: the more you invested in technology, the more likely you were to bring in more revenue, and you would be able to cut the cost of employees. Santi: If the CBO changed the way it scored technology improvements, would more Congresspeople be interested in funding technology? It is just a CBO issue. It's one we've tried to talk to them about over the last several years, but one where they've been unwilling to move. My view is that unlocking this will unlock greater investment in technology in a place like the IRS, because every dollar you invest in technology \u2014 I think \u2014 would earn back $10 in additional tax revenue we'd be able to collect from people who are skipping out on their taxes today. It's far more valuable to invest in that technology than to grow the number of employees working in enforcement at the IRS. You need both, but you can't say that a person is worth 5x their salary in revenue and that technology is worth 0. That makes no sense. Kyla: When we spoke about Direct File many months ago, people in my comment section were super excited and saying things like, \u201cI just want the government to tell me how much money I owe.\u201d When you think about the implementation of Direct File, what went right, and how do you think it has evolved? The thing that went right was that we proved that we could build something quite easily, and we built it ourselves, unlike many technology projects in government. We didn't go out and hire a bunch of consultants and contractors to do it. We did it with people at the IRS, but also with people from 18F and from GSA who worked in the government. We did it in partnership with a number of stakeholders outside the government who gave us advice, but the build was done by us. The reason that was important \u2014 and the reason it's important to build more things internally rather than hiring consulting firms or other people to build it \u2014 is that you then have the int"

    "keywords": "Clinton and Gore announcing the NPR Today, we\u2019re taking a look at a predecessor to DOGE: The Reinventing Government project (officially known as the NPR, for National Partnership for Reinventing Government ). The NPR ran for almost the full duration of President Bill Clinton\u2019s two terms, and led to the elimination of over 100 programs and over 250,000 federal jobs. Both NPR and DOGE are case studies in a long history of government reform efforts \u2014 some more successful than others. Our guest is John Kamensky , who served as Vice President Al Gore's deputy for the National Performance Review (NPR) for eight years. Kamensky was colloquially known as \u201cMr. Checklist\u201d for his work organizing the Reinventing Government initiative. Kamensky is a clear-eyed observer, and he doesn\u2019t hedge about NPR\u2019s failures and missed opportunities. In some ways, the Reinventing Government Initiative was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to cut headcount, spending, and regulation at the end of the Cold War and change the way the government operated. From the Niskanen Center We discuss: Did the NPR actually work? What was the Board of Tea Experts? Why was the federal government subsidizing mohair? NPR made the federal workforce older. Was that bad? What doesn\u2019t Elon understand about the federal government? For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Yeah, that's how I understand it. I\u2019ve researched previous reform efforts from the past century and haven't seen anything that had that kind of endurance. I would say yes, it was a success. It changed what government employees understood their jobs to be. The goal was to empower them to be able to get results, and they felt that in many cases. We conducted a survey and found that after eight years, 40% of the civil service understood what we were trying to get at \u2014 that\u2019s enough to create some momentum. Even in future administrations, people still talked about some of the initiative\u2019s outcomes. There were about 100 different statutes that included bits and pieces of our recommendations, and a number of administrative changes, like designating the deputy secretaries for various departments as chief operating officers and having them meet government-wide as the President's Management Council . I believe that has continued until today, although I don't know what the current administration's approach has been. Yes, when I was researching government reform initiatives while at the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in the late 1980s, I identified 11 in the 20th century alone. It started with the 1904 Keep Commission , and then the 1937 effort that was undertaken during the New Deal under FDR. The most famous was the 1947-1949 Hoover Commission , which led to probably the most substantial organizational changes. And then in 1955, there was a second Hoover Commission . The first Hoover Commission focused on how the government does its work and led to the creation of the General Services Administration (GSA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). That effort also led to the creation of a single overarching Defense Department across the different military services . The 1955 Hoover Commission was more focused on what the government should be doing, which led to competing functions between the government and the private sector. The idea was to eventually transition those services to the private sector, which didn't go over quite as well as the efforts in 1949 had. There\u2019s a long history of approaches to government reform: there were efforts under Johnson and Nixon , and the Grace Commission under Reagan. Typically, advisers outside of government came in to advise on best practices from the private sector, but the Reinventing Government initiative was different. We turned to civil servants and asked them what needed to be done to fix government operations, focusing on the \u201chow\u201d and not so much on what the government should be doing. This was toward the tail end of Reagan\u2019s Reform \u201888 , which were largely administrative reforms. In the late \u201880s under President George H.W. Bush , the focus shifted to improving government performance and financial management, which led to the passage of the Chief Financial Officers Act (CFO Act) in 1990. I was at the GAO at the time, and I was tapped to look at how to measure and improve government performance. I wound up looking at what was going on in other countries as examples. Under Senator Bill Roth , the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs tried to create legislation that defined performance measurements in government. There was skepticism from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB ) as to how that might be done. [ NB: We\u2019ve interviewed former OMB senior advisor Cristin Dorgelo and current Director Russ Vought for Statecraft. ] Charles Bowser, then GAO comptroller general and my boss, wanted to support Senator Roth by creating a parallel effort to improve performance accountability. I was tasked with looking into how to make what eventually became the 1993 Government Performance and Results Act realistic in the US context. After going abroad to study the approaches of other countries, I heard a talk by journalist David Osborne , who later published a bestseller called Reinventing Government . He\u2019d visited multiple states to see how they were transforming their operations. I told him, \u201cWhat you're describing is exactly what I'm seeing in these other countries.\u201d So this was in the global gestalt, and academics eventually called the movement new public management theory . The idea was that you could use business concepts \u2014 like internal competition \u2014 to improve service efficiency and the government's ability to deliver for its citizens. David Osborne and I had an ongoing conversation \u2014 he was fascinated by what other countries were doing, and I was fascinated by what he was finding in the states. In a previous book called Laboratories of Democracy , he did a case study of Bill Clinton\u2019s governorship of Arkansas, so he was in the Clinton circle. During Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, David Osborne drafted a speech on how Clinton could reinvent the federal government. That speech was never made, but the ideas stuck. When they organized the transition team, Al From of the Progressive Policy Institute was leading the government reform piece. They brought in John Sharp , who was running the Texas Performance Review, and it was more like DOGE. They went into the agencies and terrorized them to find savings. On David Osborne\u2019s suggestion, they came to me to get the international perspective. Then in early March of 1993, Clinton gave a press conference, and said the administration would create a National Performance Review . I called my counterpart at the OMB to ask what was going on, and he said, \u201cWell, this is the Clinton administration. This is live and unrehearsed. We don't know what's going on.\u201d A few days later, I get a call from Elaine Kamarck , and she says, \u201cI just started working for Vice President Gore. He was asked to do this reinventing government thing, and David Osborne says that I need to talk to you.\u201d They called me, Bob Stone , who was doing the reinvention of the Defense Department, and Bob Knisely , who was over in the Department of Transportation . I told them what was going on in other countries. Bob Stone was a sort of renegade in the Defense Department, a civilian in charge of the Department\u2019s military installations. He oversaw a large team and was trying to delegate authority; rather than having them ask whether to repave a parking lot in San Diego, he said, \u201cNo, you know whether you need to repave it, don't ask me.\u201d So he talked about how the DoD had screwed up. Bob Knisely had worked in a lot of different civilian agencies and saw parallels there. Elaine suggested we tell the Vice President about it. The three of us met at Bob Stone's house to figure out what we would tell the Vice President, because this was our one chance as civil servants to say what needed to be done to fix the government. Clinton had actually done total quality management when he was the governor of Arkansas and wanted the Reinventing Government initiative to consist of civil servants, rather than turning to business executives as Reagan had. Bob Stone had developed a set of principles for his model installation program and suggested we use those. He made this \u201c gold card ,\u201d which had those principles and Clinton and Gore\u2019s names on it. Over the years, we handed out those cards to around 100 civil servants, but the first gold card was made in the middle of a snowstorm at Bob's house to give to Gore at our meeting the next day. Bob Stone is a storyteller at heart, and he said that we really needed to convince him of how screwed up the government is. He had a box of his \u201ctoys\u201d: examples of how idiotic things were in the Defense Department. We decided to take it with us to the White House. The vice president has an office over in the corner, which Gore called the Square Office as opposed to the Oval Office. The next day, we went and sat down with him, Elaine, and the deputy director for management of OMB . After we each told our stories, Bob Stone brought out the box. He took out a can of spray paint and told a story: the Defense Department hired chemists with chemistry degrees and tasked them with making sure that each can of spray paint hadn\u2019t expired. They had to sign a little form that's stuck to the side of each can to say that the paint is still useful. Then he pulled out a steam trap, which is a metal valve that takes dirt out of steam lines in buildings. These each cost about $100, and when they start leaking steam, they leak about $50 worth of steam a week. But the procurement people wouldn't buy a replacement until they got a bulk order. That let them get them for $90, but it took about a year to get enough orders, and you lost $50 worth of steam a week in the meantime. Gore found this idiotic, and Bob Stone suggested letting the engineers on the base buy small items using a credit card rather than going through the procurement system. At the end, Gore asked us to come on for six months to help. I\u2019d had no idea this was a job interview. Bob Stone was running the base closure effort for the Defense Department and wasn\u2019t sure he could do it, but Gore said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Les Aspin , I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll let you go.\u201d [ NB: I\u2019ve interviewed my dad, Diego Ruiz, about his work on the base closure commission for Statecraft. ] Bob Knisely was the acting director of a brand new agency created by Congress, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics , and wasn\u2019t sure about leaving. And I needed to ask my wife. I knew that getting detailed from the legislative to the executive branch would not go over well at GAO. Sure enough, Senator Roth was on the floor of the Senate a few weeks later, saying that this is a violation of the separation of powers. So I resigned from GAO and was picked up in the executive branch. We also brought Billy Hamilton on board. He was the director of the Texas Performance Review for John Sharp in Texas. We had to create a new agency from scratch, and we had no office space, nothing, just some temporary space over in the New Executive Office Building . So we started making calls to recruit people from agencies. The idea was to have a staff of about 35\u201350 people. Billy Hamilton would oversee a set of teams that focused on the agencies, and I would have a set of teams that looked at government systems. At GAO, I\u2019d learned that agencies are so constrained in what they do that they can't fix themselves. We needed to fix the broader systems, like personnel and procurement. We planned a public launch at the Old Executive Office Building for April 15, 1993. I'd drafted charters for each of the teams \u2014 there were about 14 systems teams, and Billy had about 24 teams for each of the major agencies. When we got to the building, there was a line outside. Hillary Clinton was running her healthcare task force at the time, so I asked if that\u2019s what they were there for. And they said, \u201cNo no, we're here to reinvent the government.\u201d When I got inside, the place was packed. Around 250 people showed up, and we didn\u2019t know where they came from. Yeah, and that\u2019s how much office space we had. Bob Stone turned to an Air Force colonel who stood up military bases in hostile environments, and asked him to help us find more office space. He found the old headquarters for Clinton\u2019s presidential transition team, and we commandeered the building. Stone also went to GSA and said, \u201cWe need computers.\u201d The GSA said they didn\u2019t have that many computers handy, but there was a shipment coming in for the new White House staff. This guy commandeered that shipment. The White House staff always thought GSA was incompetent, but we weren\u2019t. We began breaking out into teams. Billy Hamilton implemented a process that he called \u201ctollgate,\u201d where once a week, every single team presented what they were doing and their findings to a board of myself, Bob Stone, Bob Knisely, and Billy Hamilton. As we worked, we began reconstituting some of the teams and moving things around because we were finding some overlaps. Eventually, the Vice President asked to get involved, but Bob Stone felt that we needed to have him out of the way to do our work. Bob had this brilliant idea to send Vice President Gore out to the agencies to have town hall meetings with employees. That turned out to be a really big deal. A vice president had never been to most of those agencies in person, so it created enormous buzz. He went from the US Department of Agriculture to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to the central courtyard at the Pentagon , and huge crowds of enthusiastic employees showed up. The Vice President was on stage with the department secretary to listen to these people, and they would talk about some of the most embarrassing things going on in their departments that the secretary, of course, knew nothing about. And the Vice President was sitting there taking notes. When we finished our draft report, Gore asked us to change it to reflect some of what he had heard and make recommendations based on those stories. What was interesting is that in the first six months of most administrations, you don't have the political appointees there. Yeah, and the lower-level Schedule Cs haven\u2019t been appointed yet either. There are about 1,500 of those, and another 1,200 political appointees who are confirmed by the Senate. It was basically the career civil servants and not the political appointees who were crafting the recommendations. George W. Bush actively involved his political appointees, whereas the Clinton administration brought them in later. On the systems teams, I intentionally mixed people who were experts on the system, like procurement, with people who were users of the system. There were many clashes between them about how they saw the world and which changes needed to be made. That was a creative dynamic in financial management and budget, and my job was to referee. In fact, one team had an internal divorce because they couldn't agree on something. Gore had very few dictates on what we should or shouldn't do. One of them was, \u201cI don't want any recommendations to study this more. I want recommendations to do something.\u201d Another was, \u201cDon't move boxes. Fix what's inside them.\u201d That was really sage advice, because typical government reformers want to make an org chart look rational by moving things around, even though it\u2019s really hard and costly to do. The last major department that we created was the Department of Homeland Security, and that was more than 20 years ago. That was really painful to create, and it took years to actually become functional. Gore believed that we had good people trapped in bad systems, which was the total quality management , W. Edwards Deming -type thing. That was sort of the mantra. In the second round of reinvention in \u201896, after Newt Gingrich became Speaker and the House went Republican, the NPR was asked to do a new report and study. That one was focused more on what government should do, rather than how. And much like the second Hoover Commission, it didn't land very well. Agencies were eliminated, the Interstate Commerce Commission was eliminated . My favorite was the elimination of the Board of Tea Experts, which was created in the late 1800s. I have no idea what they were doing. It was located in New York City because that\u2019s where they were importing the tea. [ NB: Although the Federal Tea Tasters Repeal Act was passed in 1996, the Board of Tea Experts wasn\u2019t formally terminated until September 19, 2023. ] Yes, that was one of the things from the Korean War. Mohair was considered a critical material because it was used to make gloves and socks for the troops. That subsidy never went away after the war ended, but we managed to kill it eventually. It actually came back after Clinton left office. We didn't do that during the first six months. Then we issued the main report and there was a big event on the South Lawn . After that, there were 38 accompanying collateral reports for each of the agencies and systems on how to implement the recommendations in the main report. Promoting the things that were screwed up wasn\u2019t such a big deal, and the GAO was finding a lot of them. Like, there were about seven agricultural field offices in every county in the United States. Yeah, five to seven Department of Agriculture field offices in each of approximately 3,000 counties, including Brooklyn. There were all of these different agencies, and the Department never co-located field offices. We found closing the offices really hard because members of Congress wanted to keep them. The story that we got was that there were so many field offices because President Lincoln had said that no field office should be further than one day\u2019s horse ride from any farmer, so field offices were about 20 miles apart. The initial report was fairly well-received, but there were some complicated dynamics. Many recommendations required statutory changes. David Osborne opted for one big reinventing government bill, but those of us who were in government knew that wouldn\u2019t quite work: A big bill would need to be sent to different committees based on their jurisdiction, then come back together, go to the other house of Congress, get split again, and come back again. We knew that would never work, and sure enough, that bill went up and it didn't pass. We ended up working with the OMB through the annual appropriating and reauthorization process, and wove this stuff in over the next few years, and eventually a lot of that stuff passed into law, but it wasn't a single big bill. Well, I\u2019d left the GAO to the executive branch, and there was tension between the National Performance Review and OMB. OMB said, \u201cWe\u2019re the Office of Management and Budget. Management is our middle name, and you guys are doing it.\u201d Bob Stone had a meeting with Alice Rivlin in the Vice President's offices and said, \u201cWe're here to reinvent the government, and you are the government.\u201d That didn't go over too well. I did eventually become an OMB employee, so they had to treat me nicely, or at least give me a phone number. Well, the main report was drafted by David Osborne. He was a journalist, so he knew how to write. He and a team of other journalists combed through the accompanying reports from all the agency and system teams, which were written by career civil servants who wrote like career civil servants, and he teased out the really interesting stories and key recommendations. So he and his writing team came up with this incredibly readable report, and instead of using the Government Publishing Office to format and publish a dry government report, we went to a private sector company and they came up with a design for the layout. You can\u2019t find that on the Internet because PDF wasn\u2019t quite public yet,"

    "keywords": "This conversation, with transit guru Stephanie Pollack, is one of my favorite conversations we\u2019ve recorded. For one, I had a blast recording \u2014 Pollack\u2019s funny, and she\u2019s got a killer Boston accent. For another, she explains some ideas I care about incredibly well \u2014 how well-intentioned regulations turn bad, how political pressures make simple things hard to pull off, why building in the real world is so hard. She taught me a huge amount about building transit. And she\u2019s a great storyteller. For context, Pollack was the deputy administrator of the Federal Highway Administration for the first half of the Biden admin. Before that, she served as secretary of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (DOT). And a while before that, before she was in the business of building stuff, she was an environmental activist who sued the Massachusetts DOT for building stuff. We get into that evolution in her career here. This is one of a series of conversations over the coming months about transit: why it\u2019s gotten so hard to build, who fights over it, and what it takes to build something people love. The difference between federal highway funding and transit funding Why Pollack changed her mind about suing major transit projects What went wrong with the Big Dig How the Green Line Extension was saved The four Ps of project delays Thanks to Sofia Scarlat and Emma Hilbert for their audio and transcript edits. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Most people don't understand that the way transit agencies get money from the federal government is very different from highways \u2014 and that fundamentally changes their abilities when delivering a mega-project. Highways can plan in advance because they know how much money is allocated to them every year. While most state transportation departments are building things, transit agencies are running transit. When they want to do a big project, they have to go through a laborious process, run by the Federal Transit Administration, and essentially get a grant. State highways are 90% building and 10% operating, while transit agencies are 90% operating \u2014 pulling off the daily commute \u2014 and 10% maintenance. Most people judge their local transit agency based on the morning or afternoon commute, whether the train showed up or broke down. Transit agencies are operators in their DNA, and highway agencies are constructors. It's not that highways don't require maintenance. There are potholes to fill, guardrails to repair, and, in Massachusetts or northern states, snow to plow. But people think differently about these systems. If you're driving, you don't think, \"Traffic was terrible today, that's the state transportation department's fault.\" But with transit, you think, \"Service was awful today, that is the transit agency's fault.\" Highway departments could learn from transit agencies about operations, but they're primarily focused on building. The federal government enlisted state highway agencies in the \u201850s, \u201860s, and \u201870s to build the interstate system. People think of the interstate system as federal because it's federally funded, but it's actually built and owned by the states. They were born to build, whereas transit agencies were born to provide service. State highway agencies don't ask for money, they simply get it. This is called formula funding or apportionment . Every five or six years \u2014 the last time was 2021 \u2014 Congress passes a bill that lays out how much money each state will get for the next several years. This is mostly for roads and bridges. Once you have that money, you don't just know what you're getting this year, but also what you\u2019re getting the following few years. The current Federal Highway Bill ends September 2026, but states are already planning projects for 2027 and 2028. They don't legally have that money yet, but, practically speaking, they do. This makes a big difference. Transit agencies get formula funding too, but it\u2019s for maintenance, not big projects. For major projects, transit agencies must apply for grants and go through a multi-year process before knowing if they'll receive funding. Once they get money for one project, they have to repeat the process for the next project. The largest transit systems \u2014 New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, San Francisco \u2014 cannot use it this way, because the federal government sees its role as supporting their maintenance, not capital projects. Smaller systems that mostly run buses have more flexibility under federal law to move money between operations, maintenance, and capital work. Later, you end up on the other side of those fights, in the cabinet of [ Republican ] Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker . At the State Department of Transportation, you're involved in building out state and local transit, and then you worked on federal highways at the Biden Federal Transit Administration. What's the through line across your work? The through line is the importance of transit, not just as transportation, but as the glue holding a region and its economy together. Transit creates access for people who can't afford or realistically use cars. That's why I sued the MBTA over fare increases that might make transit unaffordable, and sued Massachusetts when they planned highway projects while neglecting transit investment. The constant has been the centrality of transit for metropolitan areas like Boston. But I think there was a certain amount of na\u00efvet\u00e9 early in my career. I thought, \u201cWell, if they sign a legal document and say they're going to build a project, then they're legally obligated to build the project. And the money part is not my problem. The money part is their problem. They made the promise.\u201d The more I came to understand the intricacies of the financing system at the state and federal level, the more I understood that the game is actually the money . It doesn't mean anything to say, \u201cWe're going to run a world-class transit system,\u201d or \u201cWe're going to build this project by this year.\u201d None of that is true if you haven't figured out what you're building, how you're going to build it, and most importantly, how you're going to pay for it. When the Big Dig was planned in Boston, we had all these concerns that it was going to suck up all the money, and there wouldn\u2019t be money left for transit. Massachusetts has two transportation entities: the state transportation department, and the MBTA [ Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority , which operates Boston\u2019s \u201c T \u201d subway system ]. Those of us in the environmental world were very clear that we didn\u2019t want the MBTA to pay for transit that was part of this bigger eastern Massachusetts enterprise. We saw the Big Dig as a series of projects, with the transit components as important as highway elements. We thought that the commonwealth of Massachusetts would be responsible for these transit projects, and it wouldn\u2019t affect the T's budget. That was completely wrong. It's always the T's responsibility to operate the project. Another example: The Green Line Extension to the T [ northwest into Boston suburbs ] made the Green Line nearly 5 miles longer. If you try to operate a much longer transit line with the same number of trains, it's going to take way longer for a train to get from the beginning to the end, and you\u2019re going to wait at the platform longer for the next train. So you have to buy trains \u2014 I didn\u2019t know that at first. I was just thinking of the extension as its tracks, signals, platforms, right? So they had to buy 24 new trains, which cost almost $200 million. Now you own 24 new trains. Where are you going take care of those trains? There's all these FTA requirements: they have to be inspected, they have to get upgrades. The MBTA don\u2019t have enough space at their existing maintenance facility at this point: They have a certain size fleet. So now you have to build a new maintenance project. The Green Line Extension (northwest from Boston) The cost of the Green Line Extension includes 24 new cars in a brand new maintenance facility: hundreds of millions of dollars. Well, if you take the cost of the project and divide by the number of miles, you'll have a really high cost per mile. But hundreds of millions of that cost aren't to extend the system by 4.7 miles; they're to buy trains and build a maintenance facility. US transit agencies are criticized for spending more than their European or Asian counterparts, but our system is project-driven. In a different country\u2019s system, that\u2019d be in a different part of the budget. The problem for transit in the US is there is no different part of the budget. The Big Dig was a project proposed by Michael Dukakis when he was Massachusetts governor in the 1980s (1975-1979 and 1983-1991). It involved burying an elevated road running through downtown Boston that separated the city from Boston Harbor. This would improve traffic flow and create a beautiful surface area where people could stroll to the edge of Boston Harbor without navigating beneath a horrible, congested elevated highway. Officially called the Central Artery Tunnel Project, it became known as the Big Dig after Congressman Barney Frank said he had come to the conclusion that it would be easier to raise the city than lower the central artery. The Big Dig before. The Big Dig after. The Big Dig was initially estimated at $2 billion. What was the final cost? $12 billion. But that\u2019s if you don\u2019t count the cost of financing it. For some odd reason, we don't include interest on the bonds that get issued to pay for these projects. it was important because almost every transportation professional in Greater Boston, including some who later worked on the Green Line Extension, cut their teeth on the Big Dig, because it employed virtually everybody. It got a national profile because it ran so far over budget and over time. I told you at the beginning of this conversation that there's always money for highways. The Big Dig was the exception. The feds actually cut the money off and said, \u201cNo, the state has to pay for this. This is ridiculous.\u201d It's worth thinking about three different things. One, it's only a cost overrun if the cost you planned for was real. There was never a path to a $2 billion Central Artery tunnel project. There was never a $600 million Green Line Extension. When people build projects, the cost estimates at the beginning are based on almost no information. The incentive is to lowball the cost. If you tell people \u201c$12 billion\u201d at the beginning, the answer could be no. But if you say, \u201cFor only $2 billion you can transform the City of Boston and make traffic go away,\u201d then you have a conversation. Some people would say it's deliberate, some people would say it's what economists call optimism bias, right? But almost anytime you hear about a project that has doubled, tripled, quadrupled, quintupled, it actually \u2014 there was never a time it was gonna be built for that price. That price was a fantasy. The second factor is \"scope creep.\" Once you get some momentum on a project, whether it\u2019s the Big Dig or Green Line Extension or the Second Avenue Subway in New York, people see the money train and they try to get on board. \"If you're doing that, can you also fix these nearby roads or bridges? Add parks? Build a bike path?\" So the initial estimate is actually for a project that bears only a passing resemblance to the project that gets built. The project that gets built tends to be bigger, more complicated, and have more elements. Third, American infrastructure projects move incredibly slowly. The Big Dig permitting began in 1990-91, which is when Massachusetts first discussed building the Green Line Extension. The Green Line got a completion target of 2011 \u2014 a 21-year timeframe. Time is money in construction, especially when you start without full funding. When you start a project, you don't put out one big contract to build the project; you actually put out a contract for the money you have. \u201cIt's a $2 billion contract. I only have $600 million this year. I'll put a $600 million contract out. We'll start to do some preliminary work. Then at the end of that contract, I'll go procure a new contract, maybe hire a different company depending on who bids.\u201d The first company will be paid to take down all the stuff that they're no longer using. The new company will be paid to \u201cmobilize,\u201d to put up new stuff. Building projects in this series over a long time, because we don't have enough money at the beginning, is really toxic to delivering projects on budget. But it's how we've gotten in the habit of building things in this country over the last decades. Before COVID, and during most of the growth in the federally funded infrastructure program \u2014 the interstates and transit systems of the \u201880s, \u201890s, and \u201800s \u2014 we had four decades of low inflation. But because of COVID and inflation, at one recent point, the tracking measure the Federal Highway Administration uses to measure construction cost inflation grew at 2% monthly. If you delayed a project five months for a community process or a permit or procurement, you increased the cost of the project 10%. Now you don't have enough money for the project, so you go and you find more money for the project, which takes you months, during which time the cost of the project goes up. In an atmosphere of 1-2% per month construction cost inflation, you can't build projects the way you built them before. Except we still do. I find it helpful to think about 4 Ps: planning, permitting, public engagement, and procurement. It\u2019s not a bad thing to spend a long time planning. There's an argument to spend more time planning, and then go fast once you get started. But we can plan forever, and this is particularly true for projects for which we don't have enough money. If you're an elected official who supports that project, you create some sense of momentum by having planning meetings and issuing documents and doing PowerPoints and little events. Consider South Coast Rail in Massachusetts \u2014 when we held a groundbreaking ceremony, the state senator said, \"This is my fifth groundbreaking for this project.\" Because previous governors had found some money and done a little piece of work. Right. Planning and permitting, as frustrating and lengthy as they can be, they're gonna be 10-20% of your project costs. Most of your project costs are going to be from building the project. If you have short money, it\u2019s a great thing to do. Then planning is followed by permitting, which unquestionably takes too long and is too complicated in this country. The third P, public engagement, matters tremendously. Users and affected communities deserve input. The problem is, these three processes can continue forever. You've heard people call it the vetocracy, and the processes are a real pro. And what I say is the processes are a real problem. Okay? But the actual problem is that no one is willing to make a decision and find the money. Until someone is willing to make a decision \u2014 either yes we're building it and I can tell you how we\u2019ll pay for it, or no we're not \u2014 then planning and permitting and public engagement can go on and on for decades. Then, when people look backwards, they say, \u201cOh, the planning, permitting and public engagement is why it took decades,\u201d as opposed to the unwillingness to make a go/no-go decision. But really, the lack of money is why it took decades, and during those decades, we did a lot of planning, permitting, and public engagement to keep the project alive. And to be clear, there's value. You are advancing the project. Sometimes if you're creative, you find little pieces of money, and you fix some utilities that are in the way, or you fix a bridge that will need to carry train tracks. Or you fix a place where the road and train tracks meet, and if you fix 5 crossings a year for five years, then 25 grade crossings are done, and then they don't have to be part of the project. I don't want to suggest planning, permitting, and public engagement are wasteful \u2014 they're not. But the value they add to a project is small relative to what you could get with a more succinct process. The fourth P is procurement \u2014 the legal process for hiring builders. It's less discussed but crucial. Procurement adds time but also value. With the right team and contract structure, your chances of successful delivery improve dramatically. If you get procurement wrong, you're starting off in the wrong place and you haven't even begun building the project. Planning took a while, because at first the Big Dig was a combination of two road projects that were separate: One was to bury this elevated highway through the center of Boston. A second was to build another tunnel under Boston Harbor to connect Logan Airport to metropolitan Boston. The decision was made by Governor Dukakis and his transportation secretary, Fred Salvucci , to put those two together. That probably created political momentum to get it done, but a planning process that starts with two big projects and combines 'em into one gigantic process takes a long time. That\u2019s the first P, planning. Now, permitting: a lot of people talk about NEPA or the National Environmental Policy Act as permitting, and it is important. I've done probably more NEPA than anyone: I've written comments, I've sued people under NEPA, I've signed records of decision in my role as Federal Highway Administrator under NEPA. One of the problems with permitting processes is that they are sequential instead of concurrent. We do them one after another instead of at the same time. If you think about it, there\u2019s no reason you couldn't do planning and public engagement and permitting at the same time. But in the US, permitting is very non-sequential. The idea of NEPA was to gather a lot of information, give the public a chance to look at it, and use that information to better define your project, to identify what is usually referred to as the \u201clocally preferred alternative.\u201d Having finished that information gathering part of the process, then you move into actual permits. You need a permit to move utilities, to fill in part of a river, to build on part of a park, etc. Those permits can be federal, state, and local, and finishing NEPA is just the starting gun for the rest of permitting. People think it\u2019s the finish line. It\u2019s the starting line. The fact that you can litigate under NEPA is essential. If your concern is that agencies will not do their job and that they need to be held accountable. If you let them screw up the process and then they can still move on and permit and procure and build the project, that's a terrible thing. But once you subject that decision at the end of NEPA to litigation, it changes everyone's behavior throughout the entire process because everybody is thinking about the lawsuit. The NEPA process at this point is about minimizing the risk of a lawsuit, or covering your butt if there's going to be a lawsuit or creating the factual record. I'm a big supporter of intelligent de-proceduralization, but if you make the process really quick and dirty and short, and they can still litigate the result of that process, I'm not sure that it just doesn't turn into the next NEPA. I want to say something else about NEPA that we didn't know when it was passed, or even in the \u201880s. I speak as someone who literally wrote their third year law school paper about NEPA. Abundance types, people like Jen Pahlka , we don't like \u201cwaterfall\u201d decision making, right? We like test-and-learn decision making. We like the government to be able to do a little bit, learn something and then do a little bit more. Well, NEPA is the ultimate waterfall. You literally have to do this whole multi-year process before you can do anything. It assumes that when you build a big project, like the Big Dig or the Green Line Extension, that you literally know everything about the project, to the point where you can calculate exactly how many square feet of"

    "keywords": "Last week, we talked to Stephanie Pollack about salvaging a transit project in danger of failure \u2014 it was the first in a set of interviews we\u2019re running on transit. Today, we\u2019re zooming out further, and looking at how the federal government funds local transit. I\u2019m excited about the guest we landed. Peter Rogoff spent 22 years as a staffer on the most powerful Senate committee, the Appropriations Committee (on the Democratic side). \u201cApprops\u201d determines discretionary spending for agencies, and for most of his time there, Rogoff was the most senior Dem staffer. Rogoff worked on three transportation reauthorization bills (in \u201895, \u201898, and \u201805), the bills that determine how money will be distributed to transit agencies across the country. In 2008, Rogoff was a key player in introducing the idea of making new funding available to \u201cmulti-modal\u201d transportation projects \u2014 projects that benefit multiple types of transportation. The next transportation reauthorization process is coming up in 2026, and I thought it\u2019d be valuable to better understand how that bill comes together. But Rogoff doesn\u2019t just have experience budgeting: the following year, Rogoff was appointed as head of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), where he served for five years. More recently, he\u2019s been the CEO of Sound Transit , the Seattle transit agency. I didn\u2019t agree with Peter on everything in this conversation (which was recorded in February), and he\u2019s taken his fair share of criticism, but it\u2019s hard to find a figure in American life who has spent more time thinking about federal transit policy. What does the FTA do? Why don\u2019t transit agencies control their spending? How do you win Senate funding fights? Why are streetcars terrible? Thanks to Rita Sokolova for her judicious edits. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Within the US Department of Transportation , there are a number of \u201cmodal\u201d administrations, as in modes of transportation. Some of the better-known ones are the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration . The Federal Transit Administration ( FTA ) is another one: it\u2019s both the federal funder and grantmaker of transit agencies all across the country. It also regulates those transit agencies to comply with federal rules. Right. It is principally about buses, bus rapid transit ( BRT ), vans, medical transportation, and the major public rail systems, ranging from the New York City subway system all the way down to small streetcars in several cities across the country. There is also a Federal Railroad Administration , which oversees freight rail and intercity rail, like the Amtrak system. There's actually a lot of overlap between what the FTA and the FRA do \u2014 they\u2019re two different grantees that sometimes share the same track. Well, the majority of those funds are annually allocated by formula to each of the transit agencies, and those dollars are very important. It\u2019s kind of ironic, but when you testify before Congress, you sometimes get the sense that Republican members of the House just view transit as an urban activity that they needn't care about in red America, when in fact the transit agencies in more rural and suburban areas are more dependent on federal dollars than the large urban systems are. The reality is, they're all dependent on federal dollars, but the larger systems get a smaller portion of their total budget from the federal government, while the smaller systems may get 80-90% of their costs totally covered. This is something I suspect we're going to come back to a lot in this interview, and it's an expression I used frequently while at the FTA: if you've seen one transit agency, you've seen one transit agency. No two are really governed or funded the same way, nor have the same passenger profile or ways and means of moving people. Population, ridership, and the age of the system are factors. It\u2019s not a dominant factor, but older systems have more and older infrastructure to maintain. There is one program in which systems that are older than a certain date are eligible for the first tranche, then slightly newer systems can participate in the second tranche, and third systems are in another tranche. But it's principally about ridership, and there are tiers based on how many riders you carry per year. It's funny that you mentioned DC, because the Washington metro system gets a separate $150 million to transport federal employees. I would have to pull up data from the National Transit Database ( NTD ) to give you the percentages, but this is my point \u2014 there isn't a rule of thumb. Some get state appropriations, and some don't and are wholly dependent on what the city puts up. Some get sales taxes, but not property taxes. Some get property taxes, sales taxes, and motor vehicle excise taxes. The federal formula stipulates how much they're going to receive based on a set of criteria, but it's never everything they need, so they need to piece together their own local system and resources to decide how large and robust of a system they want. When you look across the 900 transit agencies in America, it's everything from a five-van operation to the entire Long Island Railroad. There are small transit agencies on Native American territories that connect workers to their places of employment. There is also a partnership between transit agencies and Medicaid that grants Medicaid recipients a transportation allocation to get to and from medical appointments, and small transit agencies provide that access. There are probably some agencies with fewer than five vans. It depends on a variety of factors. As I saw over multiple decades, there's a formula that's in the law, and then there's superseding legislation that takes dynamism into account. For example, if an agency is suddenly going to lose money due to the census and population loss, then legislation prevents those losses. Many federal programs also have small state minimums, so a state like Rhode Island or Alaska gets way more per mile of highway or per number of passengers than states like New York and California do. Focusing on the formula in the law isn't always that helpful. I will always remember a trip I took through Cleveland when I was the FTA administrator. I had been touring the country giving a speech touting the fact that the Obama administration budget was going to bring increased federal funds to their local transit agency. When I got to Cleveland, I looked through the talking points that the staff prepared for me and didn't find that bit, the winning talking point in the speech. I called back to the office and was informed that Ohio\u2019s allocation was going to decline, because we were implementing the new census and Cleveland was losing population. So, you know, you pivot. I spoke about the need for them to adequately maintain their existing system. One of the signature issues of my tenure was the State of Good Repair . When I was first confirmed as administrator, I gave a speech that was somewhat controversial. It was at the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston \u2014 at the time, Boston\u2019s MBTA was really struggling with deteriorating service because of the age of their system. At the same time, they and many other cities had applied for federal funds to expand their systems. In this speech, I focused on whether it was really appropriate for us to send more taxpayer dollars to transit agencies when they weren't adequately maintaining the system that we'd already built for them. Some folks found it a little blasphemous of me to say that they were going to be held accountable for how well they were maintaining their systems. I ultimately focused on that a lot in my tenure there and, thankfully, as a result of that drumbeat, Congress actually authorized a whole new category of grants specifically for the maintenance of major systems. \u201cSupporters of public transit must be willing to share some simple truths that folks don\u2019t want to hear. One is this \u2014 paint is cheap, rails systems are extremely expensive. Yes, transit riders often want to go by rail. But it turns out you can entice even diehard rail riders onto a bus, if you call it a \u2018special\u2019 bus and just paint it a different color than the rest of the fleet. Once you\u2019ve got special buses, it turns out that busways are cheap.\u201d The dominant mindset is that trains are inherently better than buses, but the reality is that the majority of transit trips in America are taken by bus. At that time, there was an increasing use of bus rapid transit , which is sometimes referred to as \u201ctrains on wheels.\u201d There really are some very good ones that mimic train operations; they have their own busways, which are designated lanes with no encroachment from automotive traffic. There are also some really dumbed-down systems that call themselves BRT, but are really just express bus service in mixed-use traffic. I said that paint is cheap because the bus-only lanes are often painted red. One of our projects was a dedicated busway from Hartford to New Britain, but I also signed a historic number of grant agreements for rail expansion. I just thought it was important that we ask this question. When the folks from Muni in San Francisco came in for expansion money, I required them to go back and do a review of what it was really going to cost them to adequately maintain their system. The problem wasn't just a lack of funding for maintenance; they were not being very sophisticated or smart about how they were maintaining the system. Some transit agencies would replace certain components every three years even though they could last seven, and other components were replaced every seven years, but broke down every three. Getting more sophisticated and precise about the total cost of ownership seems like a no-brainer today, but transit agencies were slow to get there. The ones with really good leadership are, but I\u2019m talking about a time well before the Six Sigma Revolution , when people started looking at the entirety of their operations and launched into continuous improvement. There's a mindset in certain transit agencies of, \u201cWe've always done it this way. Why would we change?\u201d I recently did a major assessment of the railcar procurement processes of a large and long-standing rail transit agency in America, and there were a lot of eye-opening conclusions. They\u2019ve been purchasing railcars using practices that are serving them very poorly in the current day, especially in a changed marketplace. They weren't really ready to change, and there\u2019s still internal resistance to some of our recommendations. There\u2019s a lot of inertia in old-line public agencies. There's far more political momentum behind expansion than maintenance. Transit boards are often populated by local elected officials \u2014 when I ran Sound Transit in Seattle, I had a governing board of 18 local elected officials, which was particularly large. Each of those elected officials represented jurisdictions that wanted new rail service yesterday. In many cases, they put their political capital on the line to get voters to adopt tax increases to provide those rail systems and expansions. Expanded rail service and new rail stations come with groundbreakings and ribbon-cuttings. It's harder to get elected officials to celebrate the replacement of a subsystem. It\u2019s just like water and sewer \u2014 it's a service that people take for granted and often don\u2019t see, until the inadequate maintenance translates into deteriorated and unreliable service, which then sours people on using transit. Part of the reason people really need to stay on top of maintenance is because they'll lose ridership if they're not reliable. I think transit agencies knew it, but we needed to say it out loud and get people thinking about it, like I did with Muni. We did eventually allocate a large chunk of federal dollars to expand their system, but we got them to be a lot more strategic in the process. They didn't want to come in and meet with me about their next expansion grant without talking about what they were doing on the State of Good Repair. That was an ethic that I tried to generate with transit agencies all over the country. Could you explain how the TIGER Grants came to be? TIGER Grants are one of a number of programs where non-highway projects can command large chunks of surface transportation money from the federal government, which is ironic because the idea for developing the TIGER program stemmed from a meeting I had with two highway commissioners. This was when the Obama administration was just coming into office and the economy was in its biggest recession since the Depression. I met with Kirk Steudle , who was the Highway Commissioner for the State of Michigan at the time, and Butch Brown , who was one of the Highway Commissioners in Mississippi. They explained to me that they had projects that were ready to be built \u2014 all of the environmental work had been done and they had qualified bids \u2014 but they were canceling the procurement because of the loss of revenues due to the recession. In the Recovery Act , we were charged with coming up with ways to get people back to work. I went to Senator Murray , who was the chair of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee at the time, and suggested that rather than going by the usual formulas, we should allocate a big chunk of transportation dollars to getting some of game-changing projects off the cutting room floor. We had a good bit of resistance; some of the entrenched folks on the Environment and Public Works Committee thought that everything should have gone out by highway formulas. Eventually, they didn't carry the day. The jurisdiction between some committees gets murky. The House Appropriations Committee was charged with putting together the Recovery Act, principally through a series of appropriations on two already-established programs. Those programs are authorized by other committees. In the Senate, the Environment and Public Works Committee authorizes highway programs, the Banking Committee handles transit programs, and the Commerce Committee handles rail programs, meaning intercity rail and Amtrak-type programs. The House also had balkanized committee jurisdictions for different transit modes, but they actually reformed that many years ago. Yes. Highways, transit, and rail are all authorized by what's now called the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee . In the Senate, it's divided across those three committees, which sometimes results in jockeying. In this case, the Senate Appropriations Committee was charged with developing the transportation portion of the Recovery Act, and we did, for the most part, put appropriations into known programs to get dollars out the door. But the TIGER program was an innovation. It didn't follow the norms and that got some people disgruntled. It was going to be a large discretionary grant program, rather than formula grants that would be peanut-buttered across the country. We worried that if we just followed the formula, everyone would get a little bit of money, but that it wouldn't be enough to get these big projects off the cutting room floor. If you had a discretionary grant program where the Secretary could select projects that were notable and important, especially to a national transportation system, then bigger grants could go out. We initially got a fair degree of resistance from the then-senior Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, Barbara Boxer of California. I used to kid her about that because she eventually lobbied for and celebrated TIGER Grants, as she should have. The program evolved. There will always be jurisdictional tussles between committees, but what started as a conversation about highway projects actually morphed into getting some major investments into intermodal projects. For the first few years of the TIGER program, it was a good opportunity to fund things like the streetcar projects that many mayors wanted. The FTA administered those grants, but they were allocated by the Secretary's office with my input. Bike and pedestrian projects, which cities and counties never got around to doing, also qualified, and we could give them fairly small grants. Another big departure that ruffled some feathers was that we didn\u2019t follow the so-called 80-20 highway-transit split \u2014 there's a long-standing dogma in transportation policy land that 80% of funding should go to highways and 20% to transit. It originated in the fact that 20% of the Highway Trust Fund\u2019s revenues was deposited in the mass-transit account of the Highway Trust Fund, and 80% was put into the highway account. The Highway Trust Fund has long been underwater; last I checked, it had to raise at least $170 billion over the last three or four reauthorizations just to stay afloat. So its revenues are barely relevant, because the program is surviving on general fund bailouts every few years. TIGER was innovative in that it can go to almost any mode \u2014 it can even go to port projects. It could also go to some freight rail improvements, which was controversial at the time, because freight rail infrastructure is privately owned by Class I or shortline railroads. When I started in transportation in 1989, putting public dollars into privately owned infrastructure was a big red line, but that was something that we pierced through. It was especially needed for port projects, because they really didn't have a good place to go [ for funding ]. There was a big problem with the competitiveness of our ports internationally \u2014 we were bleeding a lot of traffic to Prince Rupert in Vancouver in British Columbia, and to Halifax on the East Coast. Like I said, it morphed over time. If you look at the first round of TIGER, there were some very large allocations \u2014 over $1.5 billion . In subsequent years, the program survived, but at something like a third of funding, which was where it stayed. Then, as a result of the infrastructure bill , it got far larger again. I think the name of the program has now changed twice, and the authorizing committees finally went in and actually authorized the program\u2019s rules. Back when we were dealing with the Recovery Act, it was wide open and the Secretary's office was charged with developing the evaluation criteria. During my time, there was no notion of a set amount that would go to highway projects vs. transit projects vs. freight rail projects vs. port projects. It really was merit-based, and a matter of which projects were justified. Congressional inputs mattered too; we wanted to know which projects were important to the congressional delegations that were putting up this money every year. An innovation that we developed under the Obama administration was what we called TIGER Challenge Grants. Not all projects were shovel-ready, which President Obama was looking for in the Recovery Act, but they needed additional money to get through planning and design. It wasn\u2019t written into the law, but we provided challenge grants where we would say, \u201cHere's a smaller amount to keep you moving forward, please come back when you're ready and apply for a full-fledged TIGER Grant.\u201d I think a number of the projects that got those challenge grants did eventually get the full grant. It's not easy. I don\u2019t remember all of the factors we looked at, but we did score them. It wasn't a hard numerical score, because that would just give rise to false precision. We didn\u2019t say, \u201cOh, this project gets an 84 for sustainability, but the other one gets a 76,\u201d but we did rack and stack them. We then organized the projects into groups of highly recommended projects, recommended projects, and not recommended projects. And it\u2019s not that the \u201cnot recommended\u201d projects weren't good projects: they just weren\u2019t fully baked. There was one area where I think we had an excessive amount of confidence. Mayors across a number of cities wanted to bring streetcars back to their downtown landscape, "

I think the playbook walks a good line on how we should think about lessons from Chinese industrial and technological success. We don\u2019t want to imitate Beijing\u2019s playbook \u2014 both because America has its own advantages to leverage, and because the Chinese model relies on intellectual property theft, forced tech transfers, and coercion (I would add slave labor to that list). What we do need is the same level of seriousness that China brings to its techno-industrial agenda. Some of my favorite proposals: My colleague Caleb Watney proposes \u201c Launching X-Labs for Transformative Science Funding .\u201d Currently, the NSF, NIH, and DOE give grants mostly to existing academic institutions, but some of the best biomedical and basic research is happening in new kinds of organizations \u2014 focused research organizations and new kinds of nonprofits. Caleb lays out a roadmap to fund those within existing authorities. Sophia Brown-Heidenreich and Remco Zwetsloot write about pooled hiring authorities . We love pooled hiring and talked about them recently with David Lebryk. Colleague Tao Burga writes on conditional export controls \u2014 TL;DR, you can geolocate advanced semiconductor chips with mostly existing hardware, and functionally gate exports to a country on whether or not the chips they receive end up in China or not.

What we do need is the same level of seriousness that China brings to its techno-industrial agenda. Some of my favorite proposals: My colleague Caleb Watney proposes \u201c Launching X-Labs for Transformative Science Funding .\u201d Currently, the NSF, NIH, and DOE give grants mostly to existing academic institutions, but some of the best biomedical and basic research is happening in new kinds of organizations \u2014 focused research organizations and new kinds of nonprofits. Caleb lays out a roadmap to fund those within existing authorities. Sophia Brown-Heidenreich and Remco Zwetsloot write about pooled hiring authorities . We love pooled hiring and talked about them recently with David Lebryk. Colleague Tao Burga writes on conditional export controls \u2014 TL;DR, you can geolocate advanced semiconductor chips with mostly existing hardware, and functionally gate exports to a country on whether or not the chips they receive end up in China or not."

    "keywords": "DOGE is the most interesting story in state capacity right now. Yet although we\u2019ve talked around it on Statecraft , I haven\u2019t covered it directly since the beginning of the administration. In part, that\u2019s because of the whirlwind pace of news, but also because of the sense I get in talking to other DOGE watchers, that we\u2019re like blind men feeling different parts of the elephant. And, frankly, because it\u2019s the most polarizing issue in public discourse right now. But we\u2019re far enough into the administration that some things are clear, and I think it\u2019s relevant for Statecraft readers to hear how I\u2019m personally modeling DOGE. We\u2019re also far enough along that it\u2019s worth taking stock of what we expected and forecasted about DOGE, and where we were wrong. So here are 50 thoughts on DOGE, as concisely as possible. Effective altruists do this thing in their online posts where they specify the \u201cepistemic status\u201d of a post: how confident they are about the claims they\u2019re making. The epistemic status of this essay: low to medium confidence. [ Editor\u2019s notes like this one were added after the piece was published. ] For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: This is too broad a topic to do justice to here, and if you spend time on the internet you likely have your own view. My view, briefly: Elon Musk has many great strengths, but he is not a reliable narrator. Elon has engineered his Twitter experience in a way that constrains the information he is able to receive, which adds to the unreliable narrator problem. Elon also spends a prodigious amount of time on Twitter. The feedback loops he generates from tweeting shape his actions at DOGE to a degree I did not expect. In 2020, Venkatesh Rao wrote , \u201cOnline public spaces are now being slowly taken over by beef-only thinkers, as the global culture wars evolve into a stable, endemic, background societal condition of continuous conflict.\u201d Elon noticed this trend, enjoys partaking in beef, and has incentivized beefing as the modal form of Twitter engagement since taking over the company. The algorithm rewards beefing more now (more quote tweets and screenshots). But it\u2019s not just Twitter: \u201csubscriber capture,\u201d the incredible incentives for mainstream media outlets to cover Trump as salaciously as possible, and the architecture of the internet itself all make it very difficult to find reliable narrators. The media actors rewarded in this ecosystem are those who are good at leveraging and maintaining beefs with other actors, which in practice means partisans of one or another stripe. All of the above means that Elon looks into problems that are largely driven by institutional capture, structural incentives, and overregulation, and sees them instead as problems of waste, corruption, and fraud. Again, I don\u2019t think this is about Elon\u2019s personality so much as it is about the way the information he receives is structured. The more time you spend on the PvP platform that is social media, the more you will be primed to see enemies everywhere. There\u2019s likely some malicious compliance from disgruntled federal actors, and a huge amount of selective leaking. For an example of the latter, see the firestorm over the administration purportedly canceling cyber operations against Russia (it didn\u2019t). Many stories you read are true only in the most technical sense. If you do not believe this or do not come from a subculture that is used to being misrepresented in mainstream media, see this good list from Zvi Mowshowitz of the ways formally correct journalism can practically mislead. Information silos are crazier than ever. For example, I\u2019ve been privy to two parallel, heated debates about foreign aid over the past half-decade. People who work in foreign development (especially effective altruists) have engaged in a battle about the efficacy of various forms of foreign aid: what works best , what works less well, what doesn\u2019t work at all, and how we can know . Meanwhile, right-wingers have spent much of the last decade (since the summer of 2020 in particular) documenting how deeply embedded left-wing NGOs are in many federal ( and local ) funding programs, and developing a critique of that tight federal/NGO linkage . [ A reader points out that some of the criticism of American foreign aid on the right is older, and comes from a broader critique about the liberal world order \u2014 I think that\u2019s also true. ] But neither debate exhibits much awareness of the other at all, with very negative consequences. The DOGE team has axed the most effective and efficient programs at USAID, and forced out the chief economist, who was brought in to oversee a more aggressive push toward efficiency. It does not appear to be interested in engaging with what we know about more or less effective humanitarian aid. And people in the NGO class were completely blindsided by the animosity the Trump administration had toward them and the speed at which many of their contracts would be torn up. To stay informed on DOGE, I\u2019m drinking from the firehose a bit: one part mainstream coverage from folks like Jeff Stein , Kyle Cheney , Teddy Schliefer , and Josh Code , one part right-wing Twitter, one part Elon\u2019s tweets, two parts various DC and Silicon Valley groupchats. One common view of DOGE is that Elon is functioning as a kind of \u201csin eater\u201d or fall guy for Trump, doing the dirty work that the President himself won\u2019t do. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much to that view, and I don\u2019t think it helps explain what\u2019s happening at DOGE. See Trump\u2019s speech to Congress on Tuesday, which emphasized the cuts happening across the federal government. Elon, and DOGE, currently maintain remarkable freedom of action across the federal government. Sources I\u2019ve talked to within the administration do not have a better or more coherent sense of what DOGE is doing on a given day. They also describe DOGE operations as rather freelance-y: often, DOGE team members arrive on detail at a federal agency without a specific mandate except to poke around. [ About two hours after I published this post, President Trump held a press conference in which he suggested DOGE would wield less authority within Cabinet-level agencies going forward. Something to watch. ] One model of Elon\u2019s political worldview is folk-libertarianism of the Tea Party variety. Another is \u201ca kind of right-Maoism,\u201d as Chris Beiser suggests . Beiser points out several organizing principles, including \u201cMobilization through intense, ideological campaigns organized around concise edicts\u201d and \u201cRapid and repeated reorganizations, aimed at preventing alternate power centers from developing.\u201d I think there\u2019s something there. And there\u2019s a longer essay to be written here about how Elon rhymes with other right-wing activists, from Chris Rufo to Steve Bannon , who have inherited principles from other communist thinkers, like Lenin. [ Friend-of- Statecraft Dwarkesh Patel writes in with a quote from Chen Yun, a leading Chinese Communist Party official under Mao: \u201cHad Mao died in 1956, his achievements would have been immortal. Had he died in 1966, he would still have been a great man but flawed. But he died in 1976. Alas, what can one say?\u201d ] Some of you will remember Elon\u2019s involvement in the CR fight on the Hill in December, where it seems like the sole metric he cared about was bringing down the number of pages in the bill. Lots of the pages that were struck were important context or nuance around spending that was already going to happen. In retrospect, that episode was a foreshadowing. Early on, it seemed like DOGE would be a glorified blue ribbon commission , and I thought about what it would be able to accomplish in those terms. Although I don\u2019t think anyone expected that DOGE would be placed in the preexisting, Obama-created shell of the US Digital Service , I was probably too confident that it would take a particular form. Many of my early instincts were based on what Vivek Ramaswamy was saying DOGE would be and would focus on. I don\u2019t think I updated quickly enough after Vivek exited \u2014 he clearly had a more sophisticated vision than Elon\u2019s. You can argue about whether it\u2019s good or bad, but it was grounded in a particular conservative critique of the administrative state. See the WSJ column by Elon and Vivek (which Vivek wrote and filed himself). As the WSJ reported later, the Elon/Vivek split \u201cwas\u2026 predicated in part by DOGE\u2019s increasing attention on achieving spending cuts, which Musk has championed, and less of a focus on cutting regulations and bureaucracy, which had been helmed by Ramaswamy.\u201d The Vivek model of DOGE had a theory that overregulation constrains American economic growth, and it\u2019s a theory I mostly subscribe to. But DOGE as it exists now is not especially focused on regulatory rollback, and to the extent that it\u2019s happening it\u2019s elsewhere in the Trump administration. DOGE looks quite different than it did in November DOGE in its Elon iteration is much more focused on two metrics: number of federal employees and dollars saved. I have been told that given the political pressures on it, DOGE is focusing staffers on projects that have a figure associated with them, either headcount or dollar spend. Those are brute metrics that are quite vulnerable to Goodhart\u2019s law: \u201cWhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\u201d I do think there\u2019s plenty of wasteful spending in the federal government, and one of the upsides of DOGE is clearly the potential of creating a federal culture that is more aware of how it spends taxpayer dollars (more on this shortly). But the parts of \u201cgovernment efficiency\u201d that are easiest to message to the public are not the parts that improve state capacity. We've seen a lot of the Rand Paul-style tweeting from Elon about bad or silly experiments that science agencies fund \u2014 the shrimp running on treadmills stuff \u2014 the $500,000 we spent on this or that. The metrics DOGE is explicitly measuring against are public, but another goal of DOGE is \u201cdestroy internal enemies and punish the opposition and take the stuff they like away.\u201d To take one obvious example, the agencies being targeted for layoffs are disproportionately the ones that code left-wing . You don\u2019t read this newsletter for psychoanalysis of political figures, but there\u2019s definitely plenty of this going on: Fires and hires In November I wrote a piece for The Free Press on \u201cThe Five Things President Trump Should Do.\u201d Although I had written the piece before the general election and edited it only lightly after \u2014 the recommendations for the next administration were drawn from a broad range of our interviews and were intended to apply to either potential president \u2014 there was one recommendation that seemed especially relevant to an incoming Department of Government Efficiency. \u201cHire Bureaucrats, Just Make Them the Right Ones,\u201d it said, and emphasized that our current system makes it too hard both to fire bad bureaucrats and to hire better ones. \u201cA strategic administration will encourage agencies to find creative ways to bring in top talent. It could try using new tools to assess technically talented applicants in bulk, or it could increase the number of academic rotations through the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, which allows academics to contribute part-time to special federal agency projects. The Office of Personnel Management can and should encourage more aggressive use of Direct Hire Authority, allowing agencies to avoid certain procedural steps of the federal hiring process.\u201d So far, DOGE has focused only on the firing part, and not at all on the hiring part. That\u2019s a shame for a couple reasons. It\u2019s a missed opportunity to fix the talent pipelines that plague federal hiring. And because DOGE is constrained by a preexisting set of rules around reductions in force, the people DOGE is firing are disproportionately the more talented and more useful people. In December, I went on the American Compass podcast with Oren Cass to do some forecasting and wishcasting of DOGE. Although some of our conversation was overindexed on Vivek\u2019s public statements, there\u2019s one particular section I want to note, and it\u2019s linked here . We expected that DOGE would run into trouble if it tried to cut federal headcount with across-the-board actions, because of the way civil service protections are structured: \u201cTitle V, Part 351 of the Code of Federal Regulations means that if you're doing reductions in force across the board, you have to start with employees who are serving in specific temporary positions or those under specific special authorities, before you get to the career employees who have been there for 20 years.\u201d DOGE has indeed tried to cut federal headcount extremely aggressively (one estimate suggests it\u2019s cut 20,000 federal employees so far, although that may not be right). They\u2019ve gone about this by, as we expected, firing probationary employees and those hired under certain special authorities. Unlike tenured federal employees, probationary employees cannot appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) unless they claim discrimination or whistleblower retaliation. Note that probationary doesn\u2019t just mean \u201cin your first year on the job,\u201d but also those who have been recently promoted. In many cases, the probationary employees are exactly who I would not like DOGE to fire, from an efficiency standpoint: they\u2019re the younger, less entrenched, more technologically savvy people. Take the Bureau of Industry and Security , an agency within the Department of Commerce. BIS is mandated to enforce American export controls on \u201cdual-use technologies,\u201d like uranium enrichment technologies and high-end semiconductor chips. From a team of about 500, DOGE canned about 15 people. At least a handful of them were (in my view) some of the people best positioned to improve our ability to keep Chinese hands off the most powerful AI technologies. A similar dynamic has played out across the federal government. Firing probationary employees is what you do if your problem definition is, \u201cthere are too many employees of the federal government and there should be fewer.\u201d It\u2019s not what you would do if you defined the problem as, \u201cwe can\u2019t fire bad employees,\u201d or, \u201cgood federal employees are constrained by too much process.\u201d The administration is also shuttering the Presidential Management Fellowship, a small program that made it easier to hire new graduates outside of the usual clunky federal hiring process. Whether the cuts to probationary employees will continue is unclear at the time of writing. Many of these layoffs are being contested in court, and some of them have been undone already. You should expect long, drawn-out fights over unfair firings, and people who win their suits will be very expensive future cost streams. It\u2019s plausible that DOGE will focus on the hiring side later, and is concentrating on the painful parts now. See Machiavelli: \u201cTherefore any cruelty has to be executed at once, so that the less it is tasted, the less it offends; while benefits must be dispensed little by little, so that they will be savored all the more.\u201d But I would not rely on this theory without further evidence. As has been well covered in mainstream outlets, DOGE has been extremely sloppy about cutting contracts and reporting the numbers. Most of the biggest ticket savings have been the result of DOGE misreading federal contracting data, or killing contracts that were already dead. From the New York Times : What\u2019s more concerning than the sloppiness itself is that it does not appear to be getting resolved over time. The same kinds of data parsing errors and confusion about how federal contracts are awarded and then paid out have persisted over two months. Some of this comes back to the information environment: DOGE has instituted few if any ground-up mechanisms within the federal government to surface real savings opportunities. In January, I wrote a piece with my colleague Matt Esche calling for better data collection in the federal government , and listing a set of places the Trump administration could start. There have been some encouraging signs on this front, like future NIH head Jay Bhattacharya\u2019s commitment to focusing on \u201creplicable, reproducible, and generalizable\u201d science. But DOGE has made some missteps; for instance, as Stuart Buck has documented , it has canceled some of the most valuable long-run education studies we have. This is one of the best examples of a \u201cpenny-wise, pound-foolish\u201d orientation at DOGE: the studies cost almost nothing, provide information no private actor can provide, and create the basis for smarter policymaking at the federal and state levels. DOGE is a label that\u2019s getting slapped on all kinds of Trump administration activities, including activities that are unrelated to the actual Elon-helmed DOGE. There seem to be a couple reasons for this: for one, it\u2019s good branding for the administration, and there are incentives for non-DOGE initiatives to claim the DOGE mantle. For admin critics, calling everything DOGE plays into an \u201cElon shadow president\u201d rhetorical attack. So as a result, it can be hard to tell what\u2019s what. Analytically, I\u2019ve been trying to separate out the DOGE stuff that would have happened anyway from the stuff that\u2019s a result of the particular Elon DOGE project. There\u2019s the Elon playbook, which we\u2019ve seen at Twitter and SpaceX, of turning everything off and on and seeing what breaks. But there are also other actors involved in DOGE, and many of them are executing playbooks that would have been used anyway, even if Elon had never come on board. For example, many conservatives have pushed for the Department of Education to be dismantled since it was created. Chris Rufo put together a detailed playbook for doing so. In a world without DOGE, you would still see an attempt to shutter or to aggressively limit the department. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is another interesting example. Headlines say DOGE is canceling hundreds of contracts at the CFPB and imposing stop-work orders. But emails show that the push to functionally shutter the CFPB is not coming from DOGE, but from its Acting Director Russ Vought, who is also Trump\u2019s head of the Office of Management and Budget (you may remember our interview with him from last fall). The Chief Legal Officer of the CFPB is Mark Paoletta, a close Vought ally; he\u2019s long advocated for the CFPB to be shut down entirely. I think it\u2019s fair to say that DOGE is not the reason the CFPB is in tumult right now, even if it\u2019s the proximate cause. Vought and Paoletta also believe (and have argued ) that the president constitutionally has the power to choose not to spend, or to \u201cimpound,\u201d money that Congress has appropriated. Vought believes in unitary executive theory, that there constitutionally is no such thing as an independent federal agency. DOGE is working closely with Vought\u2019s OMB, and the moves to freeze congressionally appropriated money are originally Vought\u2019s idea. The shuttering of USAID is a fuzzier story. DOGE clearly played a key role in it, as did OMB. But the acting head of USAID, Peter Marocco, attempted many of the same moves in the first Trump administration. See the 13-page dissent memo from his first time at USAID: \u201cMarocco has leveraged once-routine administrative processes to reopen previously-approved plans, interrogate and redirect country programs, halt movement on programs, procurements, and people, and inject uncertainty into daily operations and office planning.\u2019\u201d From recent reporting , Marocco and DOGE appear to be at odds with some White House and State Department staff over USAID funding. Elon\u2019s statements on USAID have been all over the map in the last two months: at one point, he tweeted about \u201cfeeding USAID into the woodchipper,\u201d but now he describes those actions as \u201ca brief pause to do a sanity check on foreign aid funding.\u201d I don\u2019t believe that second description is an accurate representation of what h"

But a lot of readers wrote in with facets of DOGE I missed, or that they thought I didn\u2019t properly account for. In some cases, readers thought 50 thoughts were way too many, the sign of a schizophrenic or overly generous mind. Here are some reader reactions, bucketed by broad category: Yes, there are open legal questions about whether DOGE\u2019s operations are legal: for instance, whether Elon Musk taking charge of firing people at Cabinet-level agencies violates the Appointments Clause. I expect those questions to be resolved by SCOTUS. In the meantime, there\u2019s been a lot of frustration from the White House and its allies about nationwide injunctions from district judges, and calls for the administration to ignore unfavorable rulings. But despite that frustration, all the relevant actors \u2014 President Trump, Vice President Vance, GOP Senators \u2014 have emphasized that the administration will accept judicial decisions. For more on the trend toward nationwide injunctions, see our recent conversation with Nick Bagley: There Are Too Many Judicial Injunctions Santi Ruiz \u00b7 February 19, 2025 Read full story You\u2019re way too gentle/you\u2019re way too critical I got it from all sides here. Some readers thought that by trying to assess DOGE on its own terms, I was giving aid and comfort to the enemies of American democracy, etc. One of the more strident responses on these lines: There were also frustrations that I expressed a lack of certainty about what the long-term effects of DOGE would be. People were frustrated in both directions on this front. \u201cWhere is your utilitarian calculation?\u201d A word on my utilitarian calculation: I am not a utilitarian. I try in the piece to call balls and strikes: things I like that DOGE is doing, things I find egregious, etc. As time goes on, I expect we will all have a clearer sense of the upshot of DOGE. But, transparently, I think the long-term effects of this sort of thing are hard to parse (especially if you think DOGE is a big deal). We live in the shadow of the New Deal; could an outside observer tell you whether the New Deal would be net positive or negative in 1935? Maybe. But it\u2019s a hard cost-benefit to run. I\u2019ve been hearing this view a lot \u2014 and I think it has validity \u2014 DOGE is starting with the places where it\u2019s easiest to cut, so it can rack up wins, and then will take that energy to the places that need the most cutting, like DOD. It\u2019s certainly plausible that they\u2019ve picked easier targets to start with \u2014 I can\u2019t find the quote from Statecraft interviewee Russ Vought , but he\u2019s argued that in order to cut welfare, you need to win over the American people by slashing other wasteful expenditure first, the stuff that\u2019s less close to home. 23 26 4 Share Previous Next Discussion about this post Comments Restacks Adam Gurri Mar 21, 2025 This is nonsense. The administration is already ignoring judicial orders in multiple areas. Who cares what they\u2019ve \u201cemphasized,\u201d they are transparently a pack of liars. You are not calling balls and strikes, this is very obviously an enormous illegal power grab. The comparison with the New Deal is facile, and a Heritage talking point\u2014everything FDR did, *including trying to expand the Court*, he did through laws passed in Congress. That is entirely different from simply trying to personalize the power of the entire executive branch, which is very clearly what is happening. Do you really think that personalization has a great track record for improving state capacity or the ability of governments to make credible commitments? Is there anything in what is occurring that truly leads you to think either of those things could be improved by the actions being taken specifically? Yes the vagaries of fate mean that \u201cin the long term\u201d almost anything is possible, but should that really stop you from drawing the obvious conclusion about what is plainly happening in front of our faces? This is all de-institutionalization, a hallmark of personalization, and manifestly NOT something that leads to high state capacity and a beneficial environment for STEM innovations.

    "keywords": "Today I'm talking to economic historian Judge Glock , Director of Research at the Manhattan Institute . Judge works on a lot of topics: if you enjoy this episode, I'd encourage you to read some of his work on housing markets and the Environmental Protection Agency . But I cornered him today to talk about civil service reform. Since the 1990s, over 20 red and blue states have made radical changes to how they hire and fire government employees \u2014 changes that would be completely outside the Overton window at the federal level. A paper by Judge and Renu Mukherjee lists four reforms made by states like Texas, Florida, and Georgia: At-will employment for state workers The elimination of collective bargaining agreements Giving managers much more discretion to hire Giving managers much more discretion in how they pay employees Judge finds decent evidence that the reforms have improved the effectiveness of state governments, and little evidence of the politicization that federal reformers fear. Meanwhile, in Washington, managers can\u2019t see applicants\u2019 resumes, keyword searches determine who gets hired, and firing a bad performer can take years. But almost none of these ideas are on the table in Washington. Thanks to Harry Fletcher-Wood for his judicious transcript edits and fact-checking, and to Katerina Barton for audio edits. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: I was born and grew up in Washington DC, heard a lot about civil service throughout my childhood, and began to research it as an adult. But I knew almost nothing about the state civil service systems. When I began working in the states \u2014 mainly across the Sunbelt, including in Texas, Kansas, Arizona \u2014 I was surprised to learn that their civil service systems were reformed to an absolutely radical extent relative to anything proposed at the federal level, let alone implemented. Starting in the 1990s, several states went to complete at-will employment. That means there were no official civil service protections for any state employees. Some managers were authorized to hire people off the street, just like you could in the private sector. A manager meets someone in a coffee shop, they say, \"I'm looking for exactly your role. Why don't you come on board?\" At the federal level, with its stultified hiring process, it seemed absurd to even suggest something like that. You had states that got rid of any collective bargaining agreements with their public employee unions. You also had states that did a lot more broadbanding [ creating wider pay bands ] for employee pay: a lot more discretion for managers to reward or penalize their employees depending on their performance. These major reforms in these states were, from the perspective of DC, incredibly radical. Literally nobody at the federal level proposes anything approximating what has been in place for decades in the states. That should be more commonly known, and should infiltrate the debate on civil service reform in DC. Even though the evidence is not absolutely airtight, on the whole these reforms have been positive. A lot of the evidence is surveys asking managers and operators in these states how they think it works. They've generally been positive. We know these states operate pretty well: Places like Texas, Florida, and Arizona rank well on state capacity metrics in terms of cost of government, time for permitting, and other issues. Finally, to me the most surprising thing is the dog that didn't bark. The argument in the federal government against civil service reform is, \u201cIf you do this, we will open up the gates of hell and return to the 19th-century patronage system, where spoilsmen come and go depending on elected officials, and the government is overrun with political appointees who don't care about the civil service.\u201d That has simply not happened. We have very few reports of any concrete examples of politicization at the state level. In surveys, state employees and managers can almost never remember any example of political preferences influencing hiring or firing. It was in that 5-10% range. I don't think you'd find a dissimilar number of people who would say that even in an official civil service system. Politics is not completely excluded even from a formal civil service system. One of your points is, \u201cWe don't have strong negative evidence from the states. Productivity didn\u2019t crater in states that moved to an at-will employment system.\u201d We do have strong evidence that collective bargaining in the public sector is bad for productivity. What I think you and Don would agree on is that we could use more evidence on the hiring and firing side than the surveys that we have. Is that a fair assessment? Yes, I think that's correct. As you mentioned, the evidence on collective bargaining is pretty close to universal: it raises costs, reduces the efficiency of government, and has few to no positive upsides. On hiring and firing, I mentioned a few studies. There's a 2013 study that looks at HR managers in six states and finds very little evidence of politicization, and managers generally prefer the new system. There was a dissertation that surveyed several employees and managers in civil service reform and non-reform states. Across the board, the at-will employment states said they had better hiring retention, productivity, and so forth. And there's a 2002 study that looked specifically at Texas, Florida, and Georgia after their reforms, and found almost universal approbation inside the civil service itself for these reforms. These are not randomized control trials. But I think that generally positive evidence should point us directionally where we should go on civil service reform. If we loosen restrictions on discipline and firing, decentralize hiring and so forth \u2014 we probably get some productivity benefits from it. We can also know, with some amount of confidence, that the sky is not going to fall, which I think is a very important baseline assumption. The civil service system will continue on and probably be fairly close to what it is today, in terms of its political influence, if you have decentralized hiring and at-will employment. It's a good question. I think in the 1990s, a lot of people thought a combination of the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act \u2014 which was the Carter -era act that somewhat attempted to do what these states hoped to do in the 1990s \u2014 and the Clinton-era Reinventing Government Initiative , would accomplish the same ends. That didn't happen. That was an era when civil service reform was much more bipartisan. In Georgia, it was a Democratic governor, Zell Miller , who pushed it. In a lot of these other states, they got buy-in from both sides. The recent era of state reform took place after the 2010 Republican wave in the states. Since that wave, the reform impetus for civil service has been much more Republican. That has meant it's been a lot harder to get buy-in from both sides at the federal level, which will be necessary to overcome a filibuster. I think people know it has to be very bipartisan. We're just past the point, at least at the moment, where it can be bipartisan at the federal level. But there are areas where there's a fair amount of overlap between the two sides on what needs to happen, at least in the upper reaches of the civil service. \u201cHas become a bureaucratic maze which neglects merit, tolerates poor performance, permits abuse of legitimate employee rights, and mires every personnel action in red tape, delay, and confusion.\u201d Absolutely. Carter was a big civil service reformer in Georgia before those even larger 1990s reforms. He campaigned on civil service reform and thought it was essential to the success of his presidency. But I think you are seeing little sprouts of potential bipartisanship today, like the Chance to Compete Act at the end of 2024, and some of the reforms Obama did to the hiring process. There's options for bipartisanship at the federal level, even if it can\u2019t approach what the states have done. It's interesting you bring up the college graduate, because that is one recent reform: President Trump put out an executive order trying to counsel agencies to remove the college degree requirement for job postings. This happened in a lot of states first, like Maryland, and that's also been bipartisan. This requirement for a college degree \u2014 which was used as a very unfortunate proxy for ability at a lot of these jobs \u2014 is now being removed. It's not across the whole federal government. There's still job postings that require higher education degrees, but that's something that's changed. To your question, let\u2019s say the Department of Transportation. That's one of the more bipartisan ones, when you look at surveys of federal civil servants. Department of Defense, Veterans Affairs, they tend to be a little more Republican. Health and Human Services and some other agencies tend to be pretty Democrat. Transportation is somewhere in the middle. As a manager, you try to craft a job description and posting to go up on the USA Jobs website, which is where all federal job postings go. When they created it back in 1996, that was supposedly a massive reform to federal hiring: this website where people could submit their resumes. Then, people submit their resumes and answer questions about their qualifications for the job. One of the slightly different aspects from the private sector is that those applications usually go to an HR specialist first. The specialist reviews everything and starts to rank people into different categories, based on a lot of weird things. It's supposed to be \u201cknowledge, skills, and abilities\u201d \u2014 your KSAs, or competencies. To some extent, this is a big step up from historical practice. You had, frankly, an absurd civil service exam, where people had to fill out questions about, say, General Grant or about US Code Title 42, or whatever it was, and then submit it. Someone rated the civil service exam, and then the top three test-takers were eligible for the job. We have this newer, better system, where we rank on knowledge, skills, and abilities, and HR puts put people into different categories. One of the awkward ways they do this is by merely scanning the resumes and applications for keywords. If it's a computer job, make sure you say the word \u201ccomputer\u201d somewhere in your resume. Make sure you say \u201cmanager\u201d if it's a managerial job. Yes. I've always wondered, how common is this? It's sometimes hard to know what happens in the black box in these federal HR departments. I saw an HR official recently say, \"If I'm not allowed to do keyword searches, I'm going to take 15 years to overlook all the applications, so I\u2019ve got to do keyword searches.\" If they don't have the keywords, into the circular file it goes, as they used to say: into the garbage can. Then they start ranking people on their abilities into, often, three different categories. That is also very literal. If you put in the little word bubble, \"I am an exceptional manager,\" you get pushed on into the next level of the competition. If you say, \"I'm pretty good, but I'm not the best,\" into the circular file you go. That's going to immensely improve your odds. Similar to the keyword search, there's been pushback on this in recent years, and I'm definitely not going to say it's universal anymore. It's rarer than it used to be. But it\u2019s still a very common process. The historical civil service system used to operate on a rule of three. In places like New York, it still operates like that. The top three candidates on the evaluation system get presented to the manager, and the manager has to approve one of them for the position. Thanks partially to reforms by the Obama administration in 2010, they have this category rating system where the best qualified or the very qualified get put into a big bucket together [ instead of only including the top three ]. Those are the people that the person doing the hiring gets to see, evaluate, and decide who he wants to hire. There are some restrictions on that. If a veteran outranks everybody else, you\u2019ve got to pick the veteran [ typically known as Veterans\u2019 Preference ]. That was an issue in some of the state civil service reforms, too. The states said, \u201cWe're just going to encourage a veterans\u2019 preference. We don't need a formalized system to say they get X number of points and have to be in Y category. We're just going to say, \u2018Try to hire veterans.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s possible without the formal system, despite what some opponents of reform may claim. One of the particular problems here is just the nature of the people doing the hiring. Sometimes you just need good managers to encourage HR departments to look at a broader set of qualifications. But one of the bigger problems is that they keep the HR evaluation system divorced from the manager who is doing the hiring. David Shulkin , who was the head of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), wrote a great book, It Shouldn\u2019t Be This Hard to Serve Your Country . He was a healthcare exec, and the VA is mainly a healthcare agency. He would tell people, \"You should work for me,\" they would send their applications into the HR void, and he'd never see them again. They would get blocked at some point in this HR evaluation process, and he'd be sent people with no healthcare experience, because for whatever reason they did well in the ranking. One of the very base-level reforms should be, \u201cHow can we more clearly integrate the hiring manager with the evaluation process?\u201d To some extent, the bipartisan Chance to Compete Act tries to do this. They said, \u201cYou should have subject matter experts who are part of crafting the description of the job, are part of evaluating, and so forth.\u201d But there\u2019s still a long road to go. One of the interesting things about the civil service is its raison d\u2019\u00eatre \u2014 its reason for being \u2014 was supposedly a single, clear purpose: to prevent politicized hiring and patronage. That goes back to the Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883. But it's always been a little strange that you have all of these very complex rules about every step of the process \u2014 from hiring to firing to promotion, and everything in between \u2014 to prevent political influence. We could just focus on preventing political influence, and not regulate every step of the process on the off-chance that without a clear regulation, political influence could creep in. This division [ between hiring manager and applicants ] is part of that general concern. There are areas where I've heard HR specialists say, \"We declare that a manager is a subject matter expert, and we bring them into the process early on, we can do that.\" But still the division is pretty stark, and it's based on this excessive concern about patronage. Yes, but even that is a big change from the Federal Personnel Manual , which was the 10,000-page document that we shredded in the 1990s. In the \u201890s, OPM gave the agencies what's called \u201cdelegated examining authorities.\u201d This says, \u201cYou, agency, have power to decide who to hire, we're not going to do the central supervision anymore. But, but, but: here's the 300-page document that dictates exactly how you have to carry out that hiring.\u201d So we have some decentralization, allowing managers more authority to control their own departments. But this two-level oversight \u2014 a local HR department that's ultimately being overseen by the OPM \u2014 also leads to a lot of slip \u2018twixt cup and lip , in terms of how something gets implemented. If you're in the agency and you're concerned about the OPM overseeing your process, you're likely to be much more careful than you would like to be. \u201cYes, it's delegated to me, but ultimately, I know I have to answer to OPM about this process. I'm just going to color within the lines.\u201d I often cite Texas, which has no central HR office. Each agency decides how it wants to hire. In a lot of these reform states, if there is a central personnel office, it's an information clearinghouse or reservoir of models. \u201cYou can use us, the central HR office, as a resource if you want us to help you post the job, evaluate it, or help manage your processes, but you don't have to.\u201d That's the goal we should be striving for in a lot of the federal reforms. Just make OPM a resource for the managers in the individual departments to do their thing or go independent. This is one of the more stultified aspects of the federal civil service system. OPM has another multi-hundred-page handbook called the Handbook of Occupational Groups and Families . Inside that, you\u2019ve got 49 different \u201cgroups and families,\u201d like \u201cClerical occupations.\u201d Inside those 49 groups are a series of jobs, sometimes dozens, like \u201cComputer Operator.\u201d Inside those , they have independent documents \u2014 often themselves dozens of pages long \u2014 detailing classes of positions. Then you as a manager have to evaluate these nine factors, which can each give points to each position, which decides how you get slotted into this weird Government Schedule (GS) system [ the federal payscale ]. Again, this is actually an improvement. Before, you used to have the Civil Service Commission , which went around staring very closely at someone over their typewriter and saying, \"No, I think you should be a GS-12, not a GS-11, because someone over in the Department of Defense who does your same job is a GS-12.\" Now this is delegated to agencies, but again, the agencies have to listen to the OPM on how to classify and set their jobs into this 15-stage GS-classification system, each stage of which has 10 steps which determine your pay, and those steps are determined mainly by your seniority. It's a formalized step-by-step system, overwhelmingly based on just how long you've sat at your desk. Not too much. For most people, the within-step increases \u2014 those 10 steps inside each GS-level \u2014 is just set by seniority. Now there are all these quality step increases you can get, but they're very rare and they have to be documented. So you could hypothetically pay someone more, but it's going to be tough. In general, the managers just prefer to stick to seniority, because not sticking to it garners a lot of complaints. Like so much else, the goal is, \"We don't want someone rewarding an official because they happen to share their political preferences.\" The result of that concern is basically nobody can get rewarded at all, which is very unfortunate. We do have examples in state and federal government of what's known as broadbanding, where you have very broad pay scales, and the manager can decide where to slot someone. Say you're a computer operator, which can mean someone who knows what an Excel spreadsheet is, or someone who's programming the most advanced AI systems. As a manager in South Carolina or Florida, you have a lot of discretion to say, \"I can set you 50% above the market rate of what this job technically would go for, if I think you're doing a great job.\" That's very rare at the federal level. They've done broadbanding at the Government Accountability Office , the National Institute of Standards and Technology . The China Lake Experiment out in California gave managers a lot more discretion to reward scientists. But that's definitely the exception. In general, it's a step-wise, seniority-based system. I could hypothetically bring you in as a senior executive servant. The SES was created in the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act. The idea was, \u201cWe're going to have this elite cadre of about 8,000 individuals at the top of the federal government, whose employment will be higher-risk and higher-reward. They might be fired, and we're going to give them higher pay to compensate for that.\u201d Almost immediately, that did not work out. Congress was outraged at the higher pay given to the top officials and capped it. Ever since, how much the SES can get paid has been tightly controlled. As in most of the rest of the federal government, where they establish these performance pay incent"

    "keywords": "We recorded today\u2019s Statecraft after I saw this tweet from friend-of-the-pod Nick Bagley , and realized that we had to have him on immediately. What\u2019s going on here? As President Trump kicks off his second term with a flurry of executive orders, his administration is being hit with a wave of injunctions: that is, district judges around the country are ordering the federal government to pause all kinds of actions. Democrats are praising the judges, Republicans are criticizing them. But where do judicial injunctions come from? Why do they exist? Why is this moment \u201cdownright hallucinatory?\u201d It turns out that this story isn\u2019t straightforwardly about checks and balances. And at least one Democratic legal expert thinks judges are overreaching. Bagley is an expert in administrative law who served as special counsel and chief legal counsel to Democratic Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. We've had him on twice for conversations on how bureaucracy is breaking government and whether the courts broke environmental review with a recent decision. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Before we get into the big political controversies of the day, just refresh readers: what's judicial review? Judicial review is the power of the courts to review government action. This is not actually the traditional office of the courts; the traditional role of the courts was to resolve private disputes. So if I punched you, you could sue me for battery and I'd potentially owe you money, and a jury would hear our dispute. Over time, judges started playing a more central role in superintending what it is that the government does. It started out with constitutional review: the idea that the courts could review an act of Congress and decide whether it was consistent with the Constitution. That constitutional review still happens today, but the more important judicial review for the day-to-day functioning of the government comes through what you might think of as administrative review: a review of what an administrative agency or regulatory agency does. The story is complicated. In the 19th century, judicial review looked very different than it does today. From the very beginning of the Republic, the Supreme Court asserted the power to decline to apply laws that it believed were inconsistent with the Constitution: the idea being that the Constitution is higher law, and it would trump any congressional enactment that flew in the face of that higher law. In practice, federal courts were very ginger about reviewing acts of Congress and striking them down as unconstitutional, but it would do so from time to time. On the administrative side, the courts were even more hesitant to interfere with the day-to-day operations of the federal government. The executive branch doesn't sit to review the work of the Supreme Court. There was an idea that the courts likewise couldn't sit to superintend the decisions of the executive branch. That meant that each of the branches were kept in tighter, separate spheres. There were still opportunities for the courts to say when a government agent might have gone too far in certain narrow circumstances, but that judicial review tended to be fairly narrow and circumscribed relative to what we have today. It really wasn't until the 20th century, the rise of the administrative state, especially the adoption of the Administrative Procedure Act in 1946, that we get something that looks like the review we are used to today. A big pile of these executive orders have, to various extents, been immediately subject to injunctions; that is, to pauses from district court judges through this power of judicial review. Will you explain the mechanics? What's going on here? The president issues an executive order, and then what? It's a little complicated. I should say: executive orders get a lot of attention in the press, but they're really not anything more than glorified press releases. They just instruct the president's minions to do what the president would like to do. And the president himself has actually fairly few powers that he exercises directly. Most of the powers of the federal government are vested in the secretaries of departments. What these executive orders say is, \"Hey, you people that I've appointed to these positions, I'd like you to carry out my policy,\" and that matters, of course. But the executive orders themselves rarely have legal effect. You get this executive order in place, and then the agencies move to implement that executive order. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 creates a presumption that \u201cfinal agency action\u201d is reviewable in court. When an agency moves to carry out the president's instructions and does one of those final agency actions, in principle, someone harmed by that agency action can sue over it. They can say, \u201cWe think that you have either violated the law or that you've behaved arbitrarily and capriciously.\u201d In other words, you've behaved consistent with the law, but you haven't explained yourself enough, you haven't crossed your T's or dotted your I's, you've skipped some procedural steps. What we're seeing now is a rash of lawsuits that are attempting to target the agency actions to carry out those executive branch executive orders. That's exactly right. And I should add, nationwide injunctions themselves are actually pretty new on the scene over the past two decades as our politics has become more polarized, as more and more high-profile cases are brought into the judiciary. The courts have become much more comfortable enjoining the executive branch on a nationwide basis. But that's a pretty substantial shift. It used to be the case that administrative review under the Administrative Procedure Act was much narrower. It would give much more deference to administrative agencies for a variety of different reasons. And, when an agency lost, the effects of that decision were limited to the parties that brought the lawsuit itself instead of extending nationwide. Now we're seeing a judiciary that has become very comfortable with the muscular exercise of oversight authority for the executive branch. While it may seem that President Trump is running afoul of the courts an awful lot in these first few weeks, really we've seen this dynamic emerge across the last four or five presidential administrations: virtually every decision of any moment is immediately challenged in court, often by attorneys general in states that are controlled by the opposite political party. The rise of injunctions is a complicated story, but the rise of expanded judicial power is a little simpler, I think. It really has two sources. The first is that, starting in the early 1970s, there was a bipartisan consensus that the courts needed to \u201cride herd\u201d on federal agencies to a much greater extent than they had before. In those giddy post-war years, there had been so much construction, so much heedless polluting of the environment, so much relentless action, that there were a lot of people saying, \u201cWe need to protect values that we think the agencies aren't paying enough attention to. So we need to make sure to protect the environment better, we need to take better care of civil rights,\u201d and so on. A skepticism about governance took hold in the 1970s for a lot of good reasons, and that extended itself into judicial review, so you get courts acting in a much more assertive manner. That\u2019s a bipartisan consensus led by the left, but embraced as well by the right. It\u2019s still the generally prevailing view: that we depend on courts to stand up to an executive branch that might run amok. A lot of Democrats and Republicans share that view. What changed more recently is the rise of the conservative legal movement and its success in getting judges appointed to the bench. Starting in the 2000s, the Federalist Society made one of its key priorities trimming the sails of the administrative state: \u201cWe think unelected bureaucrats are driving industry into the ground. They are imposing lots of senseless rules without adequate justification. We need to get a handle on this distortion of our constitutional design. We need to put power back in the hands of elected officials. How are we going to do that? Well, we're going to get the courts to exercise even greater control over the administrative state than they have before.\u201d [ Full disclosure: this interviewer once worked on book promotion for Peter Wallison\u2019s Judicial Fortitude: The Last Chance to Rein in the Administrative State . ] As a result, we\u2019ve seen an increased assertion of authority in the federal courts over the executive branch. It was really consolidated with the demise of Chevron deference at the US Supreme Court last year, but it's been apparent in a lot of different doctrinal domains. Basically, the courts are saying, \u201cWe've been recumbent too long, we need to get back into the game.\u201d A lot of different things came together, but probably the most important factor is congressional dysfunction. In the early 2000s you have a much more polarized Congress, much deeper partisan divides, and a filibuster that makes it almost impossible to adopt any substantive legislation. You get a Congress that can't respond meaningfully to public demands and desires. What that ends up doing is putting immense pressure on the president to go it alone, to try to use the existing powers that are on the books to achieve his objectives. Presidents are pushing at the boundaries to a greater extent than we'd seen in previous years. That's part of it. At the same time, judges themselves became, I think, more polarized. We saw a higher percentage of them who became partisans in robes. When they saw presidential excesses pressing up against the boundaries of legal authority, they were offended. They were frustrated. They said, \u201cThis cannot stand,\u201d and they pushed their authorities to the limit and said, \u201cWe're going to enjoin you not just as to these parties, but nationwide. You shouldn't have done that.\u201d It's a self-righteous indignation that flows into the law. That became so commonly accepted that it became almost part of the furniture. Judges started to think that's just the way administrative review works. There are some technical reasons why some judges started to think that way, but the end result was a practice of entering nationwide injunctions with some regularity against administrative actions that the judge happened to think were unreasonable or unlawful. It's put us into a very bad place. Over the past few years, we've seen members of both parties start to recognize that nationwide injunctions can make individual district court judges into kings. They can make it really hard for the Supreme Court to hear orderly arguments about whether or not a particular administrative action is permissible, because once you get one nationwide injunction, there's a race on to the US Supreme Court to get it lifted or reimposed. So I think there's some sense of, \u201cmaybe we've gone too far.\u201d There's less of a sense of how to get out of the problem, and it's a collective action problem. Neither side wants to let their weapons go while the other side's in power. Yeah, okay, buckle up. The technical reason is actually at its base geographical. Almost all federal agencies are in Washington, D.C., which means that because of the venue rules that apply in the federal courts, almost any challenge to agency action can be brought in D.C. That, combined with specialized venue rules that channeled a lot of administrative actions to the D.C. Circuit , meant that D.C. became a center for administrative law challenges. The D.C. Circuit is the federal court that takes the lead on administrative law. When it reviews an agency action and says \u201cWe think this is impermissible,\u201d in a way it doesn't matter if that decision applies just to the party in front of it or to the whole country: if it applies just to the party in front of it, somebody else who's unhappy about that decision can just file in D.C. In D.C., by matter of precedent, that decision's already been resolved, and the challenger automatically wins. So if the government's going to lose as to one party in the D.C. Circuit, it's gonna lose as to the entire country. So the D.C. Circuit judges started to say, \u201cWell, when we set aside an agency action, we're really, as a practical matter, setting it aside nationwide.\u201d You can see how D.C.'s strange jurisdictional reach affects their thinking, and led to a comfort and a familiarity with nationwide scope of relief that translated very easily to district judges in other districts across the country as a tolerance and an embrace of nationwide injunctions. That's part of the story as well. It's hopefully one of the few things that we have in common. [ Here\u2019s our conversation with OMB Director Russ Vought. ] How to Defend Presidential Authority Santi Ruiz \u00b7 August 7, 2024 Read full story I wanted to talk to you about this in particular because the Trump administration has cried bloody murder about a bunch of these injunctions. You have Stephen Miller saying district judges shouldn't be able to set policy for the nation. You have Vice President Vance coming out and saying similar things . Elon, of course, tweeting quite a bit about this, in even more strident terms than the elected officials. I won't put words in your mouth, but I think you largely share this view of the judicial branch as overreaching in its oversight of the executive. Will you compare and contrast your view with the administration\u2019s? When I got out of law school, I clerked for a couple of years and then went to work for the Justice Department, where my job was defending the US government. It became pretty clear to me quickly that the potted vision of judicial review that I'd learned in law school didn't resemble reality. I wasn't defending the US government from lawsuits brought by scrappy upstarts at all. I was mostly defending the US government from lawsuits brought by well-heeled businesses and gadfly groups that wanted to achieve some private advantage. It got me thinking that this judicial review thing was less noble than it was cracked up to be. Over the past 15 years in the academy, I've become more persuaded that judicial review can become a very serious impediment to the smooth functioning of government operations. One of the ways you can wrap your head around this intuitively is to imagine you were running a small business. Every time you made an important decision, a three-judge panel of lawyers \u2014 who knew nothing about how to run a gym or a catering business \u2014 would tell you that you were making good decisions or bad decisions. We all understand that it would be a pretty intolerable way to try to actually run a business. In fact, we have rules that are quite deferential to business judgment for exactly that reason. But in the space of administrative law, we think that approach is completely fine. Now, there are some good reasons for that: administrative agencies have a regulatory power that private businesses don't. But the fact is that judicial review really can impede smooth administration to a degree that lawyers often don't pay enough attention to. One place you can see this is with environmental review. You know, \u201cthe National Environmental Policy Act,\u201d it sounds really good. Agencies should think about the environment before they act. Nobody can really object to that. But what happens when you subject environmental review to judicial review is that agencies get so panicky about the possibility of losing in court in front of a generalist judge who knows nothing about the domain in which they regulate that they write these thousand-page environmental statements where they chased on every conceivable available alternative, where they hired consultants through the nose \u2014 and that's in cases where the projects get off the ground. Agencies are also apt to say, \u201cLook, I'm just not even going to touch this because I can't imagine the compliance burdens.\u201d That's the problem that judicial review can lead to. So Russ Vought and I share a concern about the day-to-day interference of the courts in government action. There is something really untoward about letting a bunch of black-robed generalists come in and fly-speck agencies over what they're up to. There's a stronger case for the courts to intervene when agencies have exceeded their legal mandate. I\u2019ll roll the tape back to something I said earlier: there are two styles of administrative review. One is legal review, where you say \u201cYou've gone beyond what Congress allowed you to do.\u201d There's a stronger case for that, and where we're seeing the Trump administration bridle at some of the legal constraints that Congress has placed on it, it seems pretty appropriate for the courts to step in. There's a different judicial review that worries me a lot more, which is where courts will say, \u201cHas the agency acted arbitrarily or capriciously?\u201d That's language from the Administrative Procedure Act. The way courts adjudicate that is to decide if the agency has behaved \u201creasonably.\u201d Courts aren't in a terribly good position to judge the reasonableness of an agency action, and it creates a lot of pathologies when agencies plow so many resources into creating defensible administrative records, instead of just making the best decision and moving on to the next problem at hand. Yeah, that challenge to the limitation on NIH indirect costs is primarily a legal challenge. It's a little tricky to disaggregate the two, mostly because you tend to bring both. When you challenge the NIH cutting of indirect costs, you say both \u201cIt's unlawful\u201d and \u201cIt is arbitrary and capricious.\u201d For a lot of these Trump actions, both arguments are going to hold some appeal. Some of the injunctions, it's hard to know exactly what the basis is, because they're temporary and the judges haven't yet explained them. Take the injunctions over funding freezes, for example: there's a question about whether they are best understood as challenges to the legal requirement that agencies spend money, or as an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d challenge to a blanket order that wasn't taken with the deliberation or care that we'd normally expect of a decision of that magnitude. I think we're waiting to see how these cash out. To the extent that they rest on a firm legal foundation, I'm less concerned. To the extent that they are liberal judges who are worried about Trump administration policy, and are leveraging those anxieties about policy to stop the administration from doing stuff, I have more concerns \u2014 not because I disagree on the merits, I'm worried about lots of the stuff that the Trump administration is doing \u2014 but because that practice is, on balance and over time, destructive to good governance. I think this whole unelected thing is a bit of a canard. It turns out we can only elect a few people in any given year. There are gonna be folks carrying out government policy who aren't elected. The question is, who ought they to be? Our answer for a long time has been, \u201cbureaucrats, but only if a court says it's okay.\u201d I think that's a terrible way to try to run a government. I think we need to do much less judicial review, and we need to trust the political process more. I say that in full recognition that the political process sometimes misfires \u2014 I think we're in such a moment right now \u2014 but I haven't heard yet a suggestion about how to improve on democracy as a way of running the United States. Mechanically, it's a terrible approach to have judges \u2014 many of whom are quite partisan themselves \u2014 second-guessing and fly-specking government decisions because they happen to disagree with them on the merits. I think what I said is, you can win elections, too. And then of course, Trump did. I start by reminding people that Trump is temporary, and administrative law is permanent. Yeah, I put it on a little heart. It's tempting to think that you can s"

    "keywords": "Today\u2019s guest is a special one for Statecraft : Tom Kalil gave me the idea for this newsletter back in 2023. Tom has a special gift for formalizing implicit knowledge into explicit knowledge, and he was the one who initially suggested that we conduct exit interviews with administration officials to capture their insights the moment they were free to speak. Some background on Tom: After a career in public policy, Tom served as Deputy Director for Policy in the Obama administration\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The OSTP is a department in the Executive Office of the President, and the head of OSTP serves as the president\u2019s Science Advisor. Tom was also the Senior Advisor for Science, Technology, and Innovation for the National Economic Council (NEC). Since then, he\u2019s supported science and tech innovation as Chief Innovation Officer at Schmidt Futures , and now does the same as CEO of Renaissance Philanthropy . The OSTP has relatively little formal authority; its power is mainly advisory. But Tom\u2019s team was remarkably effective under President Obama. The team developed a rich set of mottos and maxims, which were kept on the whiteboard (see below) of Tom\u2019s deputy Kumar Garg. In our conversation, we discuss three of these mottos for working with people: For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: \u201cPeople never follow up.\u201d \u201cTalk to who owns the paper.\u201d \u201cIf you want people to do something, make it easy.\u201d The Team Kalil whiteboard (photo courtesy of Kumar Garg). We spoke to the head of Trump\u2019s OSTP, Michael Kratsios, a few months ago. That conversation is here: How to Rebuild the Arsenal of Democracy Santi Ruiz \u00b7 November 6, 2024 Read full story Thanks to my colleague Beez for her judicious transcript edits. Here\u2019s one of the failure modes that I saw: the White House would have a meeting with someone and assume that progress was going to be made. That person would try to follow up, but run into some obstacle, and wouldn\u2019t tell us \u2014 so we\u2019d be left blissfully thinking that progress was being made. So if an agency just hears from the White House once about something, they might say, \u201cOh, this isn't a priority.\u201d Save plenty of time in the meeting for, \u201cDo we agree on what the very next step is?\u201d Does that person feel comfortable? Are you telegraphing to them, \u201cHey, if for whatever reason you're having problems on your end, please contact me?\u201d And then, if you don't hear from them, reach out and say, \u201cHey, I just wanted to check in on the thing that we discussed. Is that something that you were able to make progress on? If not, is there something that I can do to be helpful?\u201d People would ask me, \u201cHow did you get this or that line in the State of the Union address?\u201d And I would say, \u201cI talked to the White House speechwriter.\u201d It's like when someone asked Sherlock Holmes, \u201cHow did you make this deduction?\u201d And then people are disappointed, because it seems trivial, but the hard part was developing the relationship with the White House speechwriter. The broader point is that policymakers do things with words in the same way that when a priest says, \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife,\u201d he has literally changed the state of affairs in the world through what philosophers call a speech act. That is often the way policy works; you have to write multiple types of documents. One type of document frames and makes a decision, and another is a document that implements that decision. These documents have different names, depending on who signs off on them. So when the president does it, we call it an Executive Order. When Congress does it, we call it legislation. When a regulatory agency does it, we call it a notice of proposed rulemaking. When a funding agency does it, we might call it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Often, policy entrepreneurs benefit from asking themselves what document or documents would need to be created or edited in order to frame and make a decision or to implement it. It\u2019s worth asking, \u201cWho has that document on their screen?\u201d If it\u2019s the policy entrepreneur themselves, that's the best situation. If we're trying to influence the budget, we have to convince the Office of Management and the Budget (OMB) to include something in the president's budget. People will mistake activity for progress. A canonical example of this is when someone comes into the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and says, \u201cI'm interested in this particular area of research, and how science and technology can help solve this problem. I will write a report that identifies the biggest and most important gaps in the federal research portfolio in this area.\u201d Then they will spend a lot of time bringing everyone together to organize workshops, draft a report, get interagency clearance for that report, and put it on the Internet. What happens next? I always used to insist that members of my team think of the end at the beginning. There might be some value to having a research agenda. I'm not saying don't do that. But I'm saying that the existence of that publication by itself does not necessarily solve a problem, just because the report exists. One of the things we did was recruit people for other organizations. Let's say that there was something that I wanted an agency to do. We might have asked them, \u201cDo you have someone who is an expert in this particular area, who could work with on this initiative?\u201d If they said no, we might have said, \u201cDo you have the budget to hire somebody?\u201d And if they said no to that, then we might have said, \u201cIf we got you someone for free, would you find them a desk and a phone?\u201d We\u2019d go down the list: we\u2019d want someone to do something, and we\u2019d want there to be someone in this particular agency working on it. If it turned out that they didn\u2019t have someone, or lacked the ability to recruit and hire someone, then we tried to make it as easy as possible for them to say yes. Or in my case, if I wanted Dr. Holdren [ then-head of OSTP ] to do something, I didn't say, \u201cI have this monkey on my back and I want to transfer that monkey from my back to your back. I have this really hard problem. Will you figure out what to do? Will you do it for me?\u201d Instead, I would say, \u201cHey, would you be willing to send an email to the Secretary of X if I drafted it for you?\u201d And then he would look at it and add something about the last time they had dinner or whatever. It's like the person who needs a letter of recommendation and is willing to give you the first draft of it. It required us to understand what different types of constraints organizations were under \u2014 what was relatively easy for them to do and what was hard for them to do. For instance, if you go to the director of DARPA and say, \u201cWouldn't it be cool if you had an R&D program designed to solve this problem?\u201d The DARPA director would likely say, \u201cIs there someone already at DARPA who could successfully pitch this, and who would be world-class at coming up with the program?\u201d So if you've taken the time to look through the Rolodex first, you're making it easier for the director to sign off. The key is to have cognitive empathy for that particular person in that organization. You need to know the answers to these questions: What is easy for them to do? What is hard for them to do? Is there anything that you can do or someone else can do to relax whatever constraints they're operating under? #1: People never follow up. #2: Who owns the paper? #3: If you want people to do something, make it easy. How to Rebuild the Arsenal of Democracy How do you make that a practice? Was it just about scheduling the next few times you'll be checking in? Do people often go to solve a problem with someone who does not own the paper? \u201cPeople never follow up.\u201d \u201cTalk to who owns the paper.\u201d \u201cIf you want people to do something, make it easy.\u201d"

    "keywords": "What happened in LA last month? On that, basically everyone agrees: devastating wildfires that killed at least 29 people and cost at least $100 billion in property damage. But why did those fires burn so intensely for so long? Here, you start to get a multiplicity of opinions. Was it climate change? Poor land management? Bureaucratic obstacles to fire mitigation? A lack of water in critical reservoirs? Slashed funding to fire departments, or missing local politicians, or any of the other potential factors? I had my view in the days after the fire broke out: bad land management, mostly caused by a lack of state capacity \u2014specifically permitting issues \u2014 against a backdrop of climate change leading to hotter and drier conditions, maybe with a sprinkling of political mismanagement thrown in. But I don\u2019t follow fires closely. So to get a better handle on the question, I got ahold of a guy named Matt Weiner. Weiner is the CEO and founder of Megafire Action: it's an advocacy group that thinks the megafire crisis is solvable. We talked about a lot here, from California's topography, to the state insurance market, to the difference between good fire and bad fire. We argued a bit about funding, as you'll see, but we shared some deep agreement about the bureaucratic reasons it's hard to do fire mitigation. Weiner grew up in LA. He's spent a lot of time working on the politics of wildfire management, as the executive director of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation. So he advised 46 members of Congress, all Democrats from California, on all kinds of California specific policy matters, including wildfire. One last note: after this interview was recorded, Senators Tim Sheehy (R-MT) and Alex Padilla (D-CA) introduced a bill to create a new unified federal wildfire force within the Interior Department. It\u2019s something Megafire Action has advocated for. California knows it has a fire problem. Why can\u2019t it control it? Where does mechanical thinning work, and where doesn\u2019t it? What tools from the Department of Defense should we be using in firefighting? Do we need more money to fight fires? Why do the country\u2019s biggest environmental groups oppose fire mitigation? Thanks to my colleague Beez for her judicious transcript edits. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: We're okay, thankfully. I grew up in Topanga Canyon , with deep familiarity with fire. I was actually in DC meeting with some senators about wildfire policy when the fires broke out, and I flew home to help my parents evacuate. Fortunately, they know the drill by now. They just leave as soon as they see something burning towards Topanga Canyon. I did. I have early memories of packing up and leaving during the '93 Malibu fires that burned through Topanga. Fast forward to 2018, I was the chief of staff to a state senator who represented the area that was burned by the Woolsey Fire . That fire burned through the Santa Monica mountains in a way we'd never seen before. I saw how all the systems that we built to deal with fire were being completely overwhelmed, even in a place that is particularly prepared for it. That made me much more focused on fire from a policy lens. There are many. When we look at Los Angeles itself, you've got the Los Angeles Fire Department, you've got the LA County Fire Department. You have Cal Fire , which is the state fire department, and is probably the best wildland firefighting force in the world. And then you've got other national players like the National Park Service, the US Forest Service and others who have a role to play in managing fire on their lands. Yes. Cal Fire is a robust, almost military-like wildfire fighting force. They\u2019re also responsible for a lot of the mitigation work that happens on state lands in California. They have deep expertise on landscape management and forestry as well, but what they're mostly known for is being the best when it comes to suppression. It is, but no one has the resources that Cal Fire has, both just because of the resources in California and the unique risk that we face in our wildland urban interface . The California Natural Resources Agency does. In a lot of cases, individual counties are responsible for work on their lands. You'll also get indigenous tribes, private landowners, and nonprofits that work on different landscapes. And then water agencies have to mitigate risk in their watersheds. When we talk about wildfire, we largely talk about two types of fire. There are these large, landscape-driven fires that we tend to see up north in California and elsewhere in the West, but also in parts of Southern California as well. Then there's these other fires, these wildland urban interface fires that usually start in the wildland. But once they get to structures, it's a structure-to-structure fire . That distinction causes different problems and requires different solution sets. The fires in Los Angeles look more like an urban conflagration or a structure-to-structure fire than a traditional wildland fire. We knew places like the Palisades and Altadena were at very high risk for a long time, but even then, it's really hard to fathom the scale of destruction. I've walked through countless fire zones over the years, and I've never seen anything like what I saw when I walked through those areas. The scale of destruction. You can know the risk is there, right? But it's still hard to fathom what looks like a war zone. It feels like pictures I've seen of Grozny . And that structure-to-structure fire, once it's hot and in those conditions, it goes through everything in a way that doesn't make sense to a lot of people who study the built environment. And six of the seven most destructive fires in California in the last hundred years have happened since 2020. I believe that's right. Also, the 20 largest fires in California history have all happened in the last 20 years. We're looking at climate change combined with years of mismanagement and poor community design creating a perfect storm here. For a long time, we got really good at suppressing fires. We took fire out of landscapes that needed to thrive. And what we're seeing is climate change and years of fire exclusion in these areas have made it so that we're pushing the bounds of what we're capable of suppressing here. It's overwhelming all of our systems. We had good fire on the land before Westerners essentially came here and took it out, right? Indigenous tribes have known how to manage these landscapes for millennia. We made a conscious decision over the last 150-plus years to take that fire out. While that has been changing, there are challenges to us doing it. Those challenges are workforce related, they're regulatory, and also the fact that we built in places where it's hard to get good fire on the ground now in certain areas. It's hard for us to do what we need to do from a landscape level. Yes. Once you've taken fire out of an ecosystem, it's really hard to restore it without going in and doing a lot of physical labor to get the land ready for it. By taking good fire out, you've left overly dense forests. Then you combine that with drought and climate change, and you've got tinderboxes everywhere. You could not reintroduce good low-intensity fire there if you wanted to right now. So you often have to do what's called mechanical thinning , which is going in and pulling out dead trees and other fuels, so that you can get the landscape ready for prescribed fire. Now, mechanical thinning alone can actually do a lot to improve wildfire risk. If you do mechanical thinning and prescribed fire, you can reduce the intensity of fires on forested landscapes by 70%. When you have mixed-intensity fires that are natural to this area, you get some areas where there's high-intensity fire, some where there's low-intensity fire, but you leave a mosaic across the landscape that allows the landscape to grow back to its natural balance. If catastrophic fire is too heavy in the mix there, then it's really hard for these landscapes to regrow to where they should be to be balanced, and it creates a feedback loop where they're more destructive from a wildfire standpoint. A good fire is one that we would see as having resource, economic, and ecological benefit: something that will leave behind a landscape that is more resilient going forward. Usually what that'll look like is a fire that creeps along the bottom of a forest, and sometimes will take a tree down. If you look at footage of indigenous tribes doing prescribed fires, it's usually not as invasive as what you see with these catastrophic fires, where the fire is jumping from the crown of the tree to the crown of the next tree, and leaving hundreds of thousands of acres of essentially moonscape in some places. If you go and look at some of the recent fires, like the Dixie Fire and the Caldor Fire , there are hundreds of thousands of acres in Northern California that may never grow back in the way we envision it. It depends. Southern California is a different landscape. These chaparral landscapes are meant to burn, but not as frequently and as intensely. Managing them and using prescribed fire in these areas is very difficult. There are areas where it makes sense, but a lot of what we're talking about with these SoCal landscapes is creating \u201c defensible space \u201d around communities to try and prevent ignitions, and to try and give firefighters the chance to stop a fire from getting into a community. Yes \u2014 Southern is much more shrubbery. It's not tall timber. It's not tall trees that are meant to survive fire in the same way. You do see a mix of oak and other things in Southern California \u2014 I'm overgeneralizing here \u2014 but the problem set is just very different. When we look at chaparral, we're creating defensible space, creating fire breaks, creating fire roads that can serve as fire breaks and access points for firefighters, so that they can make a stand to prevent the fire from jumping from one area of a canyon to another. That's usually what we're talking about. We're also talking about clearing brush and other vegetation from inhabited areas, or from roadsides where ignitions are very likely to start from a car crash. Correct. I mean, some of the mechanical thinning you would see in the South would just look different \u2014 It's actually creating those fire breaks. In the North, you're talking about actually removing a lot of biomass from these areas. I'd say the main impediment to better landscape management is resources, and then bureaucracy. When I say bureaucracy, that can include things like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which makes it very hard for us to get good fire on the ground. It can also include concerns about liability. Exactly. We've seen those fights get really contentious in the Pacific Northwest and in far northern California, where private landowners will blame the Forest Service for destroying some of their timber stock. And it can get violent. There was a story of a Forest Service employee getting arrested for a prescribed fire in Oregon by the local sheriff. That was fortunately resolved, but it sent a real chill in the wildfire community. Let me take a step back. I'll use the federal example, just because I think it's a little clearer. In this case, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act made a lot of key investments that were long overdue for hazardous fuel mitigation across landscapes. It was about 10 times what we normally spend a year. It went from about $500 million a year at the federal level to $5 billion over the course of those two pieces of legislation. That's still about 10% of what you would need to fully fund the Forest Service's 10-year crisis strategy . It\u2019s easier to spend on emergency response and recovery than it is to spend on emergency mitigation efforts. Public health is another area where that's a stark example. That's always been the case, but now people at every level understand that we can't keep putting firefighters in this impossible position year after year. No amount of suppression funding is going to get us out of this crisis. It would cost about $50 billion over 10 years to fund the wildfire crisis strategy at the current cost-per-acre. To be clear, I don't think we're going to get that at the federal level. The imperative here is for us to dramatically drive down the cost to do this. But it starts with investing in our workforce. You need to invest in a federal workforce that can do this work year-round. In addition to just doing the suppression activities, you're investing in infrastructure in areas where you need to take forest waste off forested landscapes in particular. That's expensive. Eventually you also have to invest in bioeconomy, right? You have to invest in market-based solutions around this as well. Yeah, let me paint a quick picture here. When you do a treatment project in a forested landscape, one of the things you'll do is you'll take down ladder fuels : you'll cut branches that are low-lying on trees. You'll rake the forest , to borrow terminology from President Trump. You'll take dead and invasive species and other vegetation, you'll put it in a pile. In a lot of cases, they\u2019ll come through in winter and just burn that pile for no economic, environmental, or climate benefit. Finding a way to utilize that to both drive down costs and to help us get a benefit from that is a top priority. It's an incredibly wasteful process that needs to be changed if we're going to do these things better, cheaper, faster, and at scale. I could not agree more, but if I could add one thought on that: I think there's bipartisan concern about the ability of federal agencies to absorb the kind of funding that would be necessary to tackle this problem anyway. A big part of this challenge is going to be building capacity in these agencies and helping restore faith that they can spend it effectively. When I was on the Hill at one point, we were pushing for $14 billion in hazardous fuel mitigation funding. That later went down to $2 billion in the Inflation Reduction Act. With the benefit of hindsight, it is hard for me to see how the Forest Service and other agencies could have spent that money effectively had we given it to them. That's a real problem. On the one hand, it's understandable. If you've got a one-time major investment in agencies that have been underinvested in for a very long time, it is very hard for them to just turn the spigot on and spend that money effectively. I have a lot of sympathy for the people trying to do this work. In a lot of cases, they did very good work with this funding. With one-time money, it was very hard for them to make the long-term hires you need to make to implement these programs effectively But longer-term, there is an issue here where these agencies are bifurcated. There are multiple agencies in different silos, managing different landscapes in very different ways. There's no one entity at the federal level that is responsible for our overall risk reduction goals as a country. So a lot of it is through grants. For example, FEMA will spend a lot of money on community defense grants that will \u2014 at least theoretically \u2014 go out to communities to help them make these kinds of investments. You'll also see a lot of money going to partnerships like the National Forest Foundation , American Rivers , and others who do really tremendous work on the ground and know what they're doing. It's also hard for them when they have an unpredictable funding source to be most effective, but I think those partnerships have been a real bright spot in the last couple years in getting good resilience projects on the ground. In some cases, yes. I also think you get a big difference between the agencies because they have different prerogatives. The Forest Service is part of the Department of Agriculture. They are a commodity organization that also is pursuing stewardship, right? They have a very different focus than the National Park Service, whose priority is protecting a lot of their infrastructure. And that's very different from the way the states often view this as well. They still would need to be able to build up the workforce to implement these kinds of projects, the ones who are doing it directly. I think fundamentally you also have an issue where a lot of the Forest Service salary and line items go to the planning side, and we don't have enough people in the field actually implementing these projects. That's a really big long-term issue. We need people on the ground who can do this work One area we see this is permitting. Permitting takes an enormous amount of time. To get a project on the ground, the Forest Service has to dedicate months and months and countless staff hours not just to planning a project, but also to getting all the paperwork in line. Those hours could be much better spent actually implementing projects. Yes, without question. Exactly. And putting good fire on the ground. I don't remember offhand. That does not surprise me at all. When it comes to federal land, it's a huge problem. I don't think it can be overstated. Timelines are just simply too long, given the urgency of this crisis. There's two pieces to it: one, there's the staff hours that have to go into this. But there's also the fact that it takes years for an environmental impact statement to be put in place. Even a categorical exclusion , which is a streamlined way of getting the permitting done, can still take 180 days. And that's the most streamlined version we have. And in each of these four cases, the Forest Service was still in the middle of its assessment when those forests burned down. So what's the point of the environmental review if it stops you from preventing the forest fire in the first place? I think that's exactly right, especially when we're talking about catastrophic fire. We're in a place here where the West as we know it is not going to exist as we are used to seeing it. There needs to be real urgency about how we get these projects on the ground. There are a lot of different ways we can do that, but permitting is a really big piece of that puzzle. One reason permitting takes so long is that we have an adversarial legal system. If you don\u2019t do full environmental reviews, there are entities that will sue the Forest Service and will try to get an injunction in court for not doing sufficient environmental review. A lot of these entities are environmental groups, and they\u2019re run by people who care about the environment. I don't doubt that they do. So why is an organization like the Sierra Club trying to stop controlled burns ? I think there are two issues. One is philosophical, and one is historical. There are a lot of really good reasons, from a historical standpoint, to be mistrustful of the Forest Service and other federal agencies here. If you look back to the legacy of the timber wars in the West, in the \u201880s in particular, where you had clear-cutting of old growth , many of these environmental organizations were formed during that era. The term \"tree hugger\" came from that conversation. I think there is a real reason to be mistrustful and I don't want to minimize that. From Edwards and Sutherland, 2022 . What concerns me is philosophical disagreements about whether or not this work needs to be done, whether there is merit in it. Some organizations believe we should never do any mechanical thinning, or that prescribed fire is not the appropriate tool for stewardship and land management. Other organizations really get it: They just don't quite trust the Forest Service to be given free rein to go pursue it. It's easier to work with that latter group than with the folks who philosophically don't think we need to be doing this kind of work. There are elements of the environmental community who believe we just need to sit back, let it burn because fire is natural. They ignore the fact th"

    "keywords": "Today I'm talking with Jo Freeman: a founding member of the women\u2019s liberation movement in the 1960s, a civil rights campaigner, and later a political scientist. She\u2019s not the most typical guest we\u2019ve ever had on Statecraft , to put it lightly. But I was reading an essay by my friend T. Greer , and in it, he discusses two papers Freeman wrote about the structure of America\u2019s political parties. The ideas in the papers stuck with me when I read them, and months later I realized that Freeman is still active. We connected on a call earlier this month. Here\u2019s Tanner\u2019s essay, which I highly recommend: Freeman has attended every Democratic party convention since 1964 (and almost every Republican convention). Her work looks at how the two parties actually work \u2014 not just what they believe, but how they operate as organizations . I found her approach incredibly useful for understanding the 2024 presidential race, and why the parties operate the way they do today. Why do the two parties fight so differently? What makes someone powerful in each party? How did the women's movement transform the Democratic Party? What happened to convention caucuses? Did they stop mattering? What does it mean when a movement starts \"trashing\" its own leaders? Thanks to Rita Sokolova for her judicious transcript edits. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: What were you up to in the late \u201880s when you wrote those two papers? I've been thinking about the political cultures of the two parties for a very long time. I've been to every Democratic convention since \u201864 and every Republican convention since \u201876. I've been particularly focused on what women were doing within the two parties, although I'll admit that in \u201864 they weren't really doing very much. In \u201876, they both were doing a lot, but they were doing it differently. Because I saw feminists do things differently in the different parties, I began to ask myself, \u201cWhy?\u201d The answer I came up with is that the environments they were working in were very different. We tend to think that if you\u2019ve seen one political party, you've seen them all, but that's simply not true. Party cultures differ just as societies do, and if you're going to be active in one, it helps to know what the culture is. \"There are two fundamental differences between the parties in which all others are rooted. The first one is structural: In the Democratic Party power flows upward and in the Republican Party power flows downward. The second is attitudinal: Republicans perceive themselves as insiders even when they are out of power and Democrats perceive themselves as outsiders even when they are in power.\" Tell me more about what those fundamental differences mean. The Democratic Party is composed of constituent groups, and it has pretty much always been that way, long before feminism or anything else. Therefore, exercising power within the Democratic Party involves being able to say that you accurately reflect the interests of a particular group. Those groups can be organized or they can just be ideational groups, but to be listened to, you need to be able to say, \u201cI represent X\u201d \u2014 \u201cI represent black women,\u201d or \u201cI represent Jews,\u201d or \u201cI'm speaking for the people of South Carolina.\u201d It has to be some sort of unit. The Republican Party flows downward; it's having personal connections that counts. You could see that in the last year \u2014 those who claimed to have a personal connection to Donald Trump were paid more attention than those who didn't. In previous years, it would have been a different set of connections to a different person or people, but right now it's Donald Trump; if Donald Trump wants to say bad things about you, your influence just disappears. And that's because people in the party listen to what the top is saying rather than the other way around. Let me give you an example from the \u201860s. Goldwater won the Republican nomination in 1964. He was not favored by everyone in the party, but he won the nomination. Phyllis Schlafly , whom we often think of as the organizer of the opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment , gained her influence because of her relationship with Goldwater. If not for that relationship, it's highly unlikely that she would have risen to the top of her own group. This has a lot to do with the social basis of the parties, which does change over time. The social basis today is not entirely the same as it was 60, 70, 80 years ago. The Democratic Party has generally been composed of people who do not view themselves as elites. As it becomes the party of the educated middle and upper classes, it looks less and less like that. Republican Party members, on the other hand, do view themselves as a party of elites. Today, to some extent, it's aspirational \u2014 people they want to be like, rather than people they actually are. But traditionally, they tended to be the people of the upper middle and upper classes. The Republican Party still has an awful lot of upper class people in it, whereas the Democrats tend to be people who are socially upwardly mobile, but not already at the top of the social hierarchy. Again, the social basis is changing, so what I was saying is not 100% true anymore. The key event was the 1976 Democratic National Convention . Now, it's not that women hadn't been a recognized part \u2014 there had long been a women's division of the Democratic Party, just like there was a women's division of the Republican Party. The women\u2019s division of the Democratic Party saw its primary goal as organizing women into the party, and you can trace its origins back to the 1930s. The women's liberation movement emerged in the late 1960s, early 1970s. While it recognized that it was more likely to find compatibility with the Democratic Party, it didn't see it as necessarily reflecting its interests. At the 1976 Democratic Convention, feminists organized a women's caucus to compel Carter, who everyone knew was going to be the nominee, to support the Equal Rights Amendment. The caucus also wanted to change Democratic Party rules to require that all the delegates be equally split between men and women. They had a major meeting that went on for parts of the entire convention \u2014 the conventions generally meet at night, but the meetings take place during the day. Officially, they lost , but they gained clout and showed that they represented a significant number of Democrats, even if mostly women, and that therefore, given the culture of the Democratic Party, they needed to be heard. Carter never really supported the Equal Rights Amendment, but when the convention reconvened in 1980, the delegates were equally split. So even though the rule had been rejected in the public eye, the rules had been changed informally. 1976 was probably the peak of the women's liberation or feminist movement in this country at that time. It wasn't quite as strong in 1980, but its influence was greater because it had demonstrated its ability to mobilize people, articulate issues, and get attention. Over time, the convention became composed of multiple caucuses. The two biggest caucuses were the Women's Caucus and the Black Caucus . In subsequent conventions, they met every morning. They once met at the same time, but then they began to alternate days \u2014 one would meet Monday and Wednesday, and the other would meet Tuesday and Thursday. By the 2024 conventions, they had multiplied \u2014 there were 33 caucuses . Some of them were called councils, but there were 33 identifiable groups. In addition to the Women's Caucus and the Black Caucus, there was now a climate caucus and a senior caucus and a rural caucus. They were no longer as popular as they had once been; whereas the early caucuses commanded attendance in the hundreds, last summer\u2019s caucuses had dozens. But they were still there. If you went to the Republican Convention, you did not find an equivalent to that. There were a couple of women's groups there, the National Federation of Republican Women being the most obvious. They also had Concerned Women for America , whose primary interest was evangelical Christianity and getting women to vote \u2014 vote Republican, admittedly, but to vote. There were no issue concerns. They weren't holding meetings or inviting people to debate or talk. They were holding receptions. You could be recruited, pay money, and join. In the \u201870s and \u201880s, they heard speakers and they debated. They passed resolutions. They talked about what they wanted the Democratic Party to do or not do. Last summer, they heard speakers. They didn't debate. The chair of the Democratic National Committee, Jaime Harrison , probably spoke at five or six different caucuses and councils. When he went to the Seniors Council , he talked about being raised by his grandparents. When he went to the Rural Council, he talked about being raised in rural South Carolina. No one said, \u201cJaime Harrison, you're Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and we want the committee to do X.\u201d None of that. I really don't know. You'll have to ask the Democratic National Committee that. It had become a tradition, in part because the Democratic Party is composed of constituent groups and it\u2019s simply the way things were done to give them space. Admittedly, by last summer the candidates had already been chosen and the platform already written \u2014 you could argue that there was nothing to debate. Nonetheless, in some previous conventions in which the candidates were already chosen, as Carter had been in 1976, they still had debates \u2014 \u201cWhat do we want Carter to do? What do we want the Democratic Party to do?\u201d So it faded over time. They went from being caucuses to caucuses and councils; I'm not sure I can tell you the distinction between the two beyond having read it in their literature. There may be another revolutionary moment in the future, but as of 2024, the caucuses expanded and muted. First of all, it's the National Organization for Women. That was a big debate when they named it, so I was very sensitive about that. Anyway, both parties fight. Let's just be clear about that. Democratic fights are loud, open, and public. Republican fights are behind the scenes and quieter. Take the recent Speaker's elections in the House. We all know from lots of leaked sources about the viciousness that went on behind the scenes, but on the surface, you didn't see it. This was the Republicans fighting. If it had been the Democrats, you'd have seen it. In the case of the Women's Caucus in 1976, the fights were loud, open, and public. And the fact that the Women's Caucus came forth with resolutions and it looked like they were going to command a majority of them gave them clout, because they could say they spoke for a major percentage of the Democrats. Republicans have a harder time doing that. They've certainly done it, but it's more behind the scenes, though just as vicious. Many people in my generation have a reversed perception. The Republican Party is certainly less consensual than it used to be. The Speaker race is a good example of it. Remember, I wrote that in the \u201880s. So it seems like there's an inversion there from the politics of the 80s. Yes and no. The problem was time. Do you remember the date of the Trump-Biden debate? The problem was time. There just wasn't enough time to do anything else. You say that the ideological factions in the Republican Party operate differently than they do in the Democratic Party. Why aren't all ideological fights the same? The Democratic Party operates heavily on the basis of constituency groups. They're looking for what they could get or do for their group. Ideological factions are not group-oriented in that sense. They are talking about the larger society. The standard Republican line is that lower taxes will broadly benefit society. In the \u201880s, we had what were called the \u201csupply-siders.\u201d The idea was that if you lower taxes, more money will be spent by private parties, which will in turn enhance the economy and therefore be good for the entire country. The data shows that that didn't happen at all. You see a similar thing happening now on the whole tax issue. I'll start off by saying that I don't think that trashing was invented by the women's liberation movement or by anything else individually, it's been going on forever. It takes different forms and manifests in different ways. Today, it's going on on the Internet, and the consequences are far worse. But in my day, pre-Internet, \u201ctrashing\u201d was people talking to others about how bad a person was. Not that they said or did something wrong, just that they were a bad person. Now, they didn't say, \u201cSo-and-so is a bad person.\u201d They would come up with various terms: \u201cOh, she's male-identified. She doesn't understand what it's like to be a sister.\u201d You know, that kind of stuff and much worse. They would occasionally say something to the person\u2019s face, but mostly behind their backs. It was always very, very personal. There would be a certain amount of shunning \u2014 people wouldn't be invited to meetings, they would be taken off the mailing list. Now it's an emailing list. They would essentially be ignored as though they didn't exist. There was an awful lot of that going on, and it tended to fall on two types of women. The first was women who had high rates of achievement \u2014 those who were very articulate, got interviewed by the press, and wrote articles. The other group was the women who put themselves out there. There was a slogan back in the day: \u201cEveryone wants an aggressive young man. An aggressive young woman is a bitch.\u201d And in those days, \u201cbitch\u201d was a very bad thing. In some ways it operated as a method of social control for keeping women in their place, even though it was done by feminists. That was the irony of the whole thing. I'm not sure that you can. Social movements are spontaneous and reflect, in part, the culture and the people that they emerge from. Take the civil rights movement, which had two parts. One came out of the black church. The structure of the black church is that you have a minister, a single leader. That was Dr. King, and that's why the movement could produce a Dr. King. The other part of the civil rights movement came out of the black college , which did not produce a single leader [ NB: the audio is unclear here ]. The fact that the two organizations had such different structures reflected the culture and experiences of the people who formed them. All social movements are unstable. There's no such thing as a permanent social movement. The labor movement can call itself that for decades, but it's still not a social movement. Not anymore. A social movement needs to have a combination of structure and spontaneity to allow it to progress. You can certainly have some say in how much structure, and, to a lesser extent, how much spontaneity. So I would say that if you're trying to form a movement organization, have some structure and accountability. Have some way to designate leaders or policy makers, some transparency, and a way to both put them in and take them out of power. If you don't, it's going to happen anyway and you just won\u2019t have a say in it, as I said in \u201c The Tyranny of Structurelessness .\u201d But don't expect it to be a permanent organization. It may become one, but then it\u2019s an interest group and not a movement. That's what happened with the labor movement \u2014 it\u2019s now labor unions that are permanent organizations. Some of them do some fine work, but that's not to delude ourselves into thinking they\u2019re a social movement. The feminist movement has long since ceased to be a movement. It became several things. A social movement has a combination of structure and spontaneity. Keeping those things going at the same time is the challenge. Who You Know Versus Who You Represent: Feminist Influence in the Democratic and Republican Parties The Political Culture of the Democratic and Republican Parties Why Republican Party Leaders Matter More Than Democratic Ones (by Tanner Greer) Trashing: The Dark Side of Sisterhood The Tyranny of Structurelessness In this conversation, we dig into: Jo, you\u2019ve written two papers on the political organization of the two parties, \u201c Who You Know Versus Who You Represent: Feminist Influence in the Democratic and Republican Parties ,\u201d and \u201c The Political Culture of the Democratic and Republican Parties .\u201d What were you up to in the late \u201880s when you wrote those two papers? In that second paper, you wrote: \"There are two fundamental differences between the parties in which all others are rooted. The first one is structural: In the Democratic Party power flows upward and in the Republican Party power flows downward. The second is attitudinal: Republicans perceive themselves as insiders even when they are out of power and Democrats perceive themselves as outsiders even when they are in power.\" Tell me more about what those fundamental differences mean. It seems straightforwardly true that the GOP is dominated by a single person today, but I think we tend to take Trump as a sui generis case. What's an example of that orientation from a previous era of American politics? I'm curious about the second difference you mentioned as well, that Republicans perceive themselves as insiders even when they're out, and Democrats perceive themselves as outsiders even when they're in. In one of your papers, you talk about the makeup of the Democratic coalition. You note that some groups, like black and labor interests, had been recognized parts of the coalition since the New Deal, while others, like women and gays, were relatively new participants. How did the women's liberation movement become a central part of the coalition? What were those caucuses doing at conventions in your early career, and what were they doing in 2024? So then what was the purpose of those caucuses meeting at this summer's convention? In one of your pieces, you talk about how the National Organization of Women ( NOW ) led a floor fight for a plank that then-President Carter strongly disliked. You wrote that they picked a fight that they knew they would lose but that it strengthened the organization long-term because they had demonstrated clout. You also mentioned that Jesse Jackson's thinly veiled threats to not support the 1984 ticket appear to have strengthened his hand within the Democratic Party. Can you explain that dynamic? It's funny that you highlight this difference in styles of conflict and internal party politics. You wrote , \u201cDemocratic Party politics are open, loud, and confrontational, while those of the Republican Party are closed, quiet, and consensual.\u201d Many people in my generation have a reversed perception. Well, when there was an opportunity to select a new candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination last summer, that entire debate played out behind closed doors. Based on reporting, there were a few key players in the Democratic Party who weighed in, and instead of a mini primary or convention battle, it all happened sotto voce . So it seems like there's an inversion there from the politics of the 80s. About 120 days from the election. In a piece from the late \u201880s, you describe ideological factions in the Republican Party. You write that, unlike Democratic caucuses, \u201cIdeological factions [in the Republican Party] are also not power centers independent of their relationship to party leaders\u2026 The purpose of ideological factions \u2014 at least those that are organized \u2014 is to generate new ideas and test their appeal. Initially these new ideas are for internal consumption. Their concept of success is not winning benefits, symbolic or otherwise, for their group, so much as being able to provide overall direction to the party. If successful in attracting adherents these ideas will be adopted by the party for external appeal.\u201d You say that the ideological factions in the Republican Party operate differently than they do in the Democratic Party. Why aren't all ideological fights the sa"

    "keywords": "This is the second in a two-part series with my dad, Diego Ruiz . In the first episode , we discussed his time helping run a political campaign in Nicaragua, and later his time staffing California Representative Chris Cox. Today, we jump ahead to his time as executive director of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) during the 2008 financial crisis. In this episode, we discuss: Why the SEC can\u2019t fund itself What not to say to congressional appropriators How the SEC missed the Bernie Madoff scandal Why it\u2019s so hard to staff up an agency What agency rulemaking will look like in the future Thanks to my colleague Beez for her judicious transcript edits. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: In 2006, Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA) got the nod from President Bush to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. I had been working for Univision for almost 10 years, the last few in California, running different media properties. We had a hankering to come back East. You were little, but I'm sure you would have voted yes as well. You had a great tree house in California, which I built for you and your brother. Nonetheless, we came back to D.C. I worked briefly at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), then Chris asked me to come over to the SEC as Executive Director, which is essentially the Chief Operating Officer. As Executive Director of the SEC, I ran all of the back-of-the-house operations: human resources, finances, and all the budget issues. I managed the relationship with congressional appropriators and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) by putting together our funding request, getting it approved every year, and then executing it within the four walls of the SEC. The SEC is a curious case \u2014 a curious kind of independent agency. Its chairman is appointed for a set term and can't be fired. It generates quite a bit of revenue in the form of fees from public companies that file, broker-dealers, and investor advisors that have to register with the SEC. It also generates revenue from penalties and disgorgements that are ordered as part of an enforcement action against violators of securities laws. A penalty is what it sounds like: you break the law, you're penalized, you pay a big fine. By the way, I should make clear that the Securities and Exchange Commission has civil authority, not criminal \u2014 so the SEC can't send people to jail, but it can disbar them. In an extreme case, it can forbid people from ever holding a position of responsibility in the securities industry. But most of the time, it just imposes penalties. Disgorgements are basically the coughing up of ill-gotten gains: If you engaged in insider trading and made $10 million, the SEC can and will order you to disgorge that ill-gotten profit. There's authority, as in the case of insider training, to make you disgorge up to three times what you made. Disgorgement is distinct from penalties, in that penalties punish you for breaking the law in a way that didn't necessarily lead to material gain \u2014 for example, you may have lied. You\u2019d get a penalty for that, whereas disgorgement happens when you\u2019ve stolen money. You have to cough it up. The SEC generates a lot of revenues, but those revenues don\u2019t fund the agency\u2019s operations \u2014 it\u2019s not a self-funded agency. It is reliant on an appropriation from Congress. It can\u2019t fund itself, unlike the Federal Reserve System, which funds itself from the proceeds of its open market operations. When deposit institutions have their funds deposited in a Fed account, the Fed makes money off of that, off of bond sales, etc. Not so the SEC. The SEC turns that money over to Uncle Sam and then simultaneously has to go, hat in hand, to Congress for its annual appropriation. There's a lot of reasons for that. This is a long running debate, which nowadays typically runs on a left-right axis. Those in favor of self-funding tend to be Democrats advocating for agencies whose missions they approve. They want those agencies to have more power to do their mission, and self-funding is power that isn\u2019t subject to cuts from Congress. A recent example of that would be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Elizabeth Warren's brainchild, which was established with a self-funding model from the very beginning. It was very controversial at the time and still is, but it enables the CFPB to have some degree of independence and autonomy from Congress. Conservatives or Republicans who have a problem with self-funding for agencies want to have the funding lever as part of their oversight. There've also been Democrat appropriators who oppose self-funding, because appropriators appropriate for a living, and they don't want to give up that power. They have a good reason for thinking that way. Every year my job was, among others, to work with the administration. By the way, I actually straddled the Bush and Obama administrations. I worked for 2.5 years under the Obama-appointed Chair, Mary Schapiro . I worked with the OMB to put together budget requests and then justify them to Congressional appropriations committees. Different OMBs might do it differently, but the process that I engaged in was basically a collaborative process that takes the last year as a baseline. You just kind of negotiate with OMB and present to them what you need. Depending on who's in the White House, the philosophy at OMB might be different. The Bush administration paid a lot of attention to being as efficient as possible, not asking for big increases, and keeping any increases down, especially if the administration had other priorities. The interesting thing about that process is that the agency's budget request is not your agency's budget request; it is the President's budget request. It is a part of the whole by the time it gets to Congress. And this very curious dance often develops between the appropriators and Chairmen. The appropriators will receive the Chairman of the agency in their appropriation hearing, and ask, \u201cMister or Madam Chairman, did you request everything you need? Is there anything else you need from us?\u201d It\u2019s an invitation for the agency head to say, \u201cYes, actually, I need more. And actually, my President or OMB didn\u2019t give me what I wanted, but now that I have your ear, Congressman, I\u2019m going to ask you for more.\u201d That's what they're fishing for. Now, an agency head that actually responds in that way is inviting summary dismissal because the agency head is meant to salute the OMB budget request. That\u2019s what the President is asking for. You don't go around your President. There is this highly instructive story that makes the rounds in budget circles in Washington about a former head of the Army Corps of Engineers who was asked that question in his Senate appropriations hearing on the Hill. This head of the Army Corps of Engineers took the opportunity to say, \u201cNo, I think we're being underfunded in the President's request. I really don't think we're equipped to carry out our mission and we need more.\u201d He was on the street looking for work practically the next day . It was a complete and total process foul, and he paid the ultimate price for it, which was to get canned. Yes, that is the main chance. But then of course Congress has its say. This little dance that I described has different variations to it \u2014 here's another one that I encountered: I believe it was the first, maybe second year that Obama was in office. Senator Schumer decided that he wanted to give the Securities and Exchange Commission, I believe it was $20 million extra for enforcement. I can't remember if it was 2009 or 2010, but financial crisis enforcement was absolutely on everyone's minds. There was a feeling that those greedy bastards on Wall Street got away with something, more people need to be in jail, more people needed to be brought to justice. Enforcement always grabs a big headline. It's a good headline for the SEC, too \u2014 not just for the member of Congress who's providing the funding. In any event, Schumer got an earmarked $20 million for enforcement included in the appropriations for the SEC. Now, that's great if you're sitting on the agency side and all of a sudden you have $20 million more than you would have otherwise, but it creates a whole bunch of additional questions and challenges for you. One of them is, \u201c$20 million extra from what baseline?\u201d Because externally, the SEC budget doesn\u2019t distinguish between different divisions. It requires an internal calculation. \u201cIs it a plus up from what we asked for? Is it a plus up from what we got last year? Is it a plus up from what we spent last year?\u201d Right. The other thing is, in an agency like the SEC, where the biggest expenditure is people, how do you spend $20 million extra for enforcement this year without knowing if it's going to be part of your appropriation next year too? Because you're hiring people, you're hiring more lawyers, more investigators, more forensic accountants to prosecute these cases in year one. What do you do in year two if the money dries up? If Senator Schumer forgets about you in year two? You can say it, but next year you're gonna have presumably a big bump-up in your headcount that you'll have to show. The full effects of that headcount won't be visible yet, because you hire people over the course of the year. That $20 million gets spent over time. Let's assume you're spending it all on people: You can't hire $20 million worth of lawyers on day one. Right. So you're not paying an annualized salary till the end. If you want to actually spend $20 million in year one, you actually have to hire probably $40 million worth \u2014 I'm making up these numbers. Because you're hiring over the course of the year and you won't actually spend all that money on salaries in one year, because it takes time to get people on board, and so on. At the end of year one, when you're going back for next year's appropriation, you\u2019re now presenting double the head count that you got funding for in year one. That was the only way to spend the money. And in that year, that first year of Obama, Democratic Congress, post-financial crisis, and a big head of steam behind financial regulation in the form of Dodd-Frank , we were getting so much pressure from Congress to spend, spend, spend. I would have appropriation staff, senior appropriation staff, calling me to check on our hiring numbers and our hiring pipeline over that year. They were getting engaged because they were giving us this money. We had to spend it. They didn\u2019t want to see us slow-walking it or taking our time. They wanted us to be able to come back the next year and justify the levels they gave us. The last thing they wanted was for us to leave all this money unspent, which is yet another of the perverse incentives of Washington. I'm sure that you could hint and you could get a message across, but you probably don't want to do that as an agency head. You probably want to leave that at the staff level. The danger is that, at the end of the day, appropriators are political animals, and they want credit. They're not necessarily in the business of giving you stuff without you asking for it, because in the asking comes a certain transfer of power. The asking is, in part, the coin of the realm \u2014 for the same reason that, if you're a rank-and-file member of Congress and you want a project for your district, you're going to have to ask for it. It's going to have to be on the record, and then you're going to have to vote for that appropriations bill. Even if you hate 99 percent of it, if your project is in there, that's how it works. You have to vote for it. If you don't vote for it, you'll never get another dime again. This is not a direct comparison to an agency, but there's a lot of the same political dynamics at work. That *wink, wink, nudge, nudge* from a staffer \u2014 even a senior staffer like me \u2014 to the senior clerk of the appropriations committee: maybe it works, but most likely it doesn't. That\u2019s not how that business gets transacted. I don't think so. I think if you're an appropriator, you are by definition inured to the political risks of overspending, because your job is to spend. A billion here, a billion there. Pretty soon we're talking real money, right? I don't know if there's any real risk. In fact, there's plenty of examples of agencies or cabinet departments getting more than the President asked for, and the President saying, \u201cNo, no, no; I don't want that much.\u201d And Congress says, \u201cYou need that much because we want you to do A, B, C, and D.\u201d Historically, it\u2019s been Democratic appropriators who do that. In this day and age, I don't see many deficit hawks in either party. I remember having big arguments with the Director of Enforcement \u2014 very bright guy, had a lot of respect for him. Logically, from his perspective, he wanted all that money and he wanted to hire, hire, hire. And he kind of understood that in order to spend $20 million, he would need to hire many more than $20 million worth of annual salaries. I was the one who had to tell him basically, \u201cI'm sorry, I can't release all of this to you because that'll put us in a very bad position next year, and we might have to furlough or fire people or make other cuts in other parts of the building, which are just as important from a mission perspective.\u201d Yes, we did. So it wasn't 100% people; we put it towards some forensic tools. I think that was the year when we embarked on a multi-year effort to build out a tips and complaints system. If I'm not mistaken, it was the SEC\u2019s first foray into taking in the mass of tips that we received in one way or another and putting them through some sort of an AI-like triage process to figure out what to prioritize. This was immediately in the aftermath of the Bernie Madoff scandal . The Madoff scandal had been brewing for something like 15 years over multiple administrations and SEC Chairmen, but it blew up in the interregnum between Obama's election and his inauguration in December 2008. Those were dark days at the SEC because we were in the middle of the financial crisis which had been raging all year \u2014 but especially in the fall. At the height of the presidential election, John McCain briefly suspended his campaign. He tried to call off the second debate to urge everyone to come back to Washington and \u201cfix it.\u201d I think Obama had gotten the better of him, but I don't think it was that bad. I think McCain had some big headwinds, not the least of which was the financial crisis itself. He was just looking to do something to change the narrative and throw a curveball into the mix. And he didn't have any better idea than to say, \u201c Let's suspend the campaign and fix it. \u201d I just remember Obama licking his chops and saying, paraphrasing, \u201cSure, John, let's go. Let's suspend the campaign, and I'll go back and put this squarely on the desk of the incumbent President.\u201d It didn't go well for McCain. But anyway, I believe this is a carol for another Christmas. The financial crisis had many fathers. The SEC, I think, was by far the least of them. But in any event, we were still in the eye of the storm because we regulated a lot of the implicated entities. And then the Bernie Madoff scandal broke, and that one was squarely on the lap of the SEC. There\u2019s no way to avoid that. No two ways about it. Over the course of those 15 years, we\u2019d had inspectors and examiners in his shop and looking at the books. We'd received tips that we had inadequately followed up on. He had, oftentimes by a hair's breadth, gotten away with perpetuating his scam. And the SEC didn't catch it. It was, in many ways, asleep at the switch. That's a great question. And there's been a lot written on this, but, there were tips from people who understood the investment advisor business. They could tell that, from a mathematical perspective, there was no way he could be generating those types of returns. His returns were incredibly consistent, too. It wasn't just that they were good year after year. It was that they were consistent. Usually, you have cycles, peaks and valleys. You have sectors that overperform or underperform, even if you're a dominant investor. I think, in the SEC's defense, there's just a lot of investment advisors out there and broker-dealers to examine. The structure of the SEC has changed somewhat since I left. What was then the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations has since been upgraded to a division. I believe it's gotten more resources. But still there are many, many, many more investment advisors and advisory firms than you have the manpower to truly examine year after year. It's a fractional reserve system, just like a bank. If everyone wants their money out of the bank at the same time, the entire banking system collapses. Exactly. It's the old Bedford Falls building and loan model. Your money's in Joe's house. And, it's similar for examinations: You do enough exams that over time you hit maybe every investor advisor, but you're not hitting them every year. You're not digging deep every year and you're looking for certain things that may raise red flags. The bottom line is that, in Madoff\u2019s case, we missed those red flags. In retrospect, but probably even at the time, some of those red flags should have been very obvious. And they weren't. We didn't catch it. Yes. I arrived at PepsiCo with the remit of handling all corporate regulatory issues in the government affairs and public policy shop. And in week two of my being there, my boss calls me into his office and asks, \u201cHey, would you like to also run the Latin America government affairs shop? Our government affairs person for LATAM just left.\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, please!\u201d I was very excited to get that additional responsibility. So I double-hatted for all of my time at PepsiCo, which ended up being almost 10 years. In the context of my Latin America work, we determined that we had to close our biggest food plant in Argentina, a plant in one of the larger suburbs of Buenos Aires. This plant made chips \u2014 salty snacks of the Frito-Lay line, which is part of PepsiCo. This plant was old. It was increasingly encroached upon by residential neighborhoods that didn't appreciate the noise and the smells. As delicious as the tasty smells are, it's different when they're in your backyard. But most importantly by far was the union that its workers had joined. In Argentina, the unions hold outsized power in the balance between employer and employee. This particular union that represented the workers at that plant was Trotskyist, violent, and recalcitrant. It made operating this plant a money-losing game. They sank the operations and the profitability of this plant just by the very nature of the positions they held. They believed, as an article of faith, that the company had to turn over the means of production to the workers because that's what aligned with their Trotskyist ideology. I don't mean Trotsky as an epithet. I mean that they had Trotsky reading groups and they were affiliated with a Trotskyist splinter party. They literally believed that the means of production had to be in the hands of the worker and that the company that signed their paycheck every other week was their oppressor. We had tried to work with them over the years, and there were more reasonable factions to the union, but this was the faction that was in power. At the end of a long process, we determined that we had to close that plant down. We had another plant about five hours away, which was more modern and pretty state-of-the-art. It happened to be right next to the potato-growing region of Buenos Aires province, so from a supply chain perspective, it was perfect. And it was outside of the control of this particular union bargaining unit. So we mapped out this process for months. We carefully thought it through from HR, legal, and production perspectives. For a while, we had contingency plans to import product from Brazil to cover"

I went on the American Compass podcast last month to talk to American Compass chief economist Oren Cass about government efficiency, state capacity, and what Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is likely to tackle. Why is it so hard to fire federal employees? Off-the-wall ways to save government money The West Coast meets East Coast dynamic in DOGE The secret to a successful blue ribbon commission Notes: This interview was recorded on December 2nd and originally published here .

For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Hello, my name is Oren Cass. I'm the chief economist at American Compass. Today we are talking about DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, with Santi Ruiz, who is senior editor and author of the Statecraft newsletter at the Institute for Progress. He wrote a fantastic piece recently for the Free Press , \" The Five Things President Trump Should Do on Day One ,\" and in his work at Statecraft has done a great job identifying what's real and what's vaporware in these discussions about opportunities for cutting red tape, making government more efficient, reducing headcount, and cutting spending. Some of it might actually happen, some of it could be really positive, and some of it looks less promising, and we will dive into all of that. You had a fantastic piece really diving into how a Trump administration should approach some of these questions. What do you see as the top one or top three most important points of focus for getting this kind of thing done? Santi Ruiz: Sure. I flagged the top five in this piece; one of them is hiring and firing. Elon and Vivek have talked quite a bit about clearing out a bunch of employees right off the bat. Earlier in 2024, Vivek suggested firing all employees with odd-numbered Social Security numbers. I think there's a deeper question that I'm sure they're thinking about: not just how do you reduce headcount right now, but how do you fix the hiring and firing process in general? The federal government fires people at a rate four times lower than the private sector for a variety of procedural reasons. Federal bureaucrats can all appeal their own firings internally. There's no \"for performance\" requirement. You have powerful public sector unions, and a variety of rules about who has to be fired first when you're doing reductions in headcount. Certain kinds of employees are protected if you're doing large-scale cuts. It's also really hard to hire good talent. In this piece, I talk about a vignette that Jen Pahlka flagged about a kid named Jack Cable who was 17 when he won the Department of Defense's \"Hack the Air Force\" contest. He beat 600 other applicants. He found all these weaknesses in Pentagon software. He was excited and decided to apply for a Pentagon job, but the HR manager did not recognize the coding languages he listed, so his resume was graded \"not minimally qualified,\" and he was told to take a hike. They told him that if he spent a couple of years at Best Buy and put that on his resume, it would help him get the job later. So there's a two-sided problem that you can't just fix by firing a bunch of folks off the bat. You need to find ways to make it easier to hire good talent to bring them in the first place, and to be able to fire the bad folks consistently ten years from now. It strikes me that there are a few different issues. There's the question of whether you can fire bad people, which is very different from whether you can hire good people. Obviously we want the government to run efficiently and effectively. But firing is also sometimes pitched as a key source of savings, right? \u201cWe're going to save so much if we got rid of 50% of the workers.\u201d One of my concerns is that if you save hundreds of millions of dollars, that makes a big difference if you're running Twitter. If you're talking about the federal budget deficit, it's barely another day's interest payment. Which of those ends are really in focus here? Is it getting the best people doing the job? Is it efficiency? Is it savings? What's actually practical to be going after? Yeah, Elon and Vivek have flagged three things that they're interested in. They wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed where they flagged cutting regulation, reducing costs to the taxpayer, and I believe the last one was something like administrative efficiency or effectiveness. They acknowledge in that piece that the things they're looking at are not going to make a massive dent in the federal deficit. As your listeners probably know, defense spending, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid constitute the bulk of federal spending. They acknowledge that, and I think there are certainly savings that you can find in many places that I expect them to be looking. At IFP , my home think tank, one thing we're interested in is state capacity more broadly. There's a whole bunch of problems with the way the federal government does the things it tries to do right now. The hiring and firing issue is a classic version of this long-term state capacity problem. Maybe you can save some hundred million dollars here and there by reducing headcount, but if you want to make the thing work better long term, you need to be able to do that consistently. You need to be able to not just cut 20%, but hire and fire for the long haul. That might mean increasing pay for certain roles, which is a big problem, especially in technical areas, where Silicon Valley pays five times what D.C. can pay. Maybe you can't match the private sector, but you can reduce that gap a little bit. In the research we do at American Compass, we find that everyone complains about the federal government and says they want smaller government. If you ask people which of the things that the federal government does they actually don't want it to do, there's almost nothing. The actual functions that the government provides are essentially all overwhelmingly popular, which helps to explain why we have them all. I think there is both a recognition that a lot of federal work does get done very poorly and inefficiently and a real desire for change there, but that\u2019s very different from cutting. Cutting can make things worse, not better, if you do it with an eye toward just saving money. I want to spend some time diving into each of the different elements you've laid out. You've got the hiring, you've got the firing, you've got the more long-term process improvement. On hiring, is higher pay feasible? Where should we actually be aiming if we wanted to be hiring better talent? So, on pay \u2014 Congress can change the fundamental pay scales. Obviously, it's a hard political sell to go to constituents and say \u201cWe should pay federal employees more money,\u201d even if it's a smart thing to do. But there are a lot of tools that the executive branch does have to tinker on the margins here. The Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) is a way to get academic talent on short-term rotations, one to two years. The Biden administration has used it quite a bit. You end-run the normal pay scale and bring these people in on short timelines. Outside entities can pay their salary. So you could have an academic on loan from their parent institution, doing interesting work at the federal level. There's also work that's been done recently under something called SMEQA \u2014 don't ask me to spell out the acronym, we can link it in the show notes [ Subject Matter Expert Qualification Assessments ]\u2014 where basically agencies can do batched hiring for technical positions. Instead of putting out one role at a time, you can say, \"Look, we need programmers, we need a bunch of them, they all need to meet certain qualifications, but we need to hire 50 of them.\" Things like that, which shouldn't seem like incredible innovations, actually are at the federal level. So more aggressive use of those sorts of things would be valuable. [ An editor\u2019s note, courtesy of our friend Jen Pahlka: \u201cSMEQA technically only addresses the lack of assessments. Pooled hiring is a separate process (which is part of the problem.) And the procedures currently required to use assessments, through SMEQA or other pathways, are so onerous that they're only really worth it if you do it for a lot of candidates at once, so the two need to go together. But I'm hoping that the new head of OPM can blow up the 318-page manual that governs use of assessments, get rid of most of those bottlenecks, and make this much better.\u201d ] It also might be possible to convince Congress to bail out certain agencies, even if you can't change the overall pay scale. You could say, \"Look, the Department of Energy needs technical talent, and right now we can't get it because you're paying a quarter of what the private sector pays. Can we do a separate pay scale for technical talent?\" That's something that exists already in some places, where the federal government acknowledges that even though we can't increase bureaucrat pay across the board, everybody knows that the elite computer programmers need a little bit more of an incentive. It's not exactly a log-rolling exercise, but if we are actually reducing headcount, there hypothetically is a world in which you could simultaneously be boosting pay and reducing cost, which presumably would be a little bit more palatable on the legislative side. I remember I was on C-SPAN's Washington Journal recently, where you get a wide variety of interesting questions from the viewing public. We were talking about the deficit, and someone called in to ask if we could cut congressional pay as a way to tackle the deficit. I was walking through the problem, both that it's 500 people getting paid a couple hundred thousand dollars a year \u2014 you can do the math there \u2014 but more importantly, that at this point we are paying our congressmen less than somebody can get in their first year as a law firm associate. Thinking that we're going to end up with a more effective government by cutting that further is probably quite backward. But it is awfully difficult to make the contrary case, especially in an environment where people do feel like the government is so ineffective. You have a bootstrapping problem: no one wants to pay more for what we have now, and we're not going to have anything different unless we pay more. But I do wonder if you could pair having fewer people with maybe paying them more. That is something that I also dream about. With DOGE especially and the general tech realignment, you do see a lot of people who would not have thought twice about a federal role in the past now thinking, \u201cMaybe there's a role for me to play here.\u201d I think the good government reformers I know all acknowledge, \u201cLook, we're never going to get parity with the private sector on certain kinds of roles.\u201d That's not the point \u2014 it's a fool's errand. But what you can do is just make the number a little less of an insult to somebody who would see something five times that number in the private sector. There are plenty of civic-minded folks who need a little bit more of a nudge to get in the door. But maybe you can reduce headcount quite a bit and then distribute the savings. Connor O'Brien at EIG had this interesting idea of sourcing savings ideas from agency staff and then cutting them in, giving them a small share of the savings generated that way. The idea being that you're never going to find all of the waste, fraud, and abuse looking at it from the top. And you actually need good ideas from the bottom. And to do that, you need to incentivize the production of those good ideas. There\u2019s a wild ratio between the amount of funding that these folks send out the door compared to the amount that they are themselves being paid. In other words, the typical bureaucrat in an agency may be paid $70,000 a year, and may in effect be signing off on hundreds of millions of dollars going out the door. If you could get rid of the element that doesn't need to be going out the door, the extra $20,000 to the employee is a rounding error in what a more effective job would amount to. I think that's right. My colleague Caleb Watney had this idea that if the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) at Commerce, which is responsible for export control work, seized and kept the proceeds from one shipment of illegally shipped semiconductor chips, I think it would self-fund - it would double the funds dedicated to BIS that year. Okay, on the firing side, what do you think is actually plausible? Putting aside how to do it well, just: what will the actual scope of authority and potential action be in a single administration? I have a lot of uncertainty here and I won't pretend to be confident. Vivek in particular has talked about ways, on the margins, to basically encourage the equivalent of self-deportation for federal employees. Mandating employees come back into the office five days a week, and then saying, \"Look, if you don't want to, there's a door,\" or creating other onerous checkpoints or removal of perks that employees have gotten used to over the past few years. Although that seems like a good way to lose all of the best employees first. Yes. If you're just going for reducing headcount, period, the people who are probably the most desperate to hang on are the people who will have fewer opportunities in the private sector. Just to put it bluntly, unless you're firing for performance and you're finding ways to fire for performance, which is difficult in the federal government - there's the equivalent of performance improvement plans that you require to put people on every step of the way \u2014 you're going to lose a lot of the people you would really like to keep, a lot of the smart people. There's also a federal regulation which, again, Jen Pahlka flagged \u2014 Title V, Part 351 of the Code of Federal Regulations means that if you're doing reductions in force across the board, you have to start with employees who are serving in specific temporary positions or those under specific special authorities, before you get to the career employees who have been there for 20 years. And so what that means is people who you've brought in, technical talent on special kind of outside authorities \u2014 Everybody you talked about a few minutes ago as the examples of best hiring. Exactly. And the people who you imagine Elon and Vivek would be most excited to work with \u2014 you have to start by taking a pound of flesh there before you move on. So there's a bunch of regulatory questions. I do think it's a good sign that the House is forming a parallel committee . If you can get some of the recommendations from DOGE straight into a House bill, then at least you get a better chance at incorporating some of those into law. One of the problems with blue ribbon commissions or advisory committees is you don't have the political power, the clout afterwards to make the recommendations stick. You would think Elon does, potentially, so maybe that's one of the ways that stuff actually gets into legislation. I'm curious about the political economy there, though. Obviously, you have fairly powerful public sector unions and lobbies that are resisting that sort of change. On the flip side, it does seem to me you have an awful lot of political momentum, both in a Republican Party that is hoping to carry forward some of Donald Trump's priorities here and, frankly, in a Democratic party that is quite desperate to find savings and perhaps even improvements in government performance that don't require cutting programs. How does that come out in the wash? This looks like the kind of place where the case for action would potentially swamp the concentrated resistance to it. But obviously for a hundred years that has not actually been the case. What's going on there? Yeah. Folks who spend a lot of time on this in Washington say there's been lots of improvement on the margins in various ways. Congress functions better than it did 10 years ago, for instance. So you see these little tweaks where, especially when it's not a highly publicized issue, there's lots of room for bipartisanship. Senator Sanders came out and said that he's fully on board with the DOGE effort to cut waste at the Pentagon. Everybody has their pet peeve. And it's true, there's incredible waste at the Pentagon. It just failed its seventh audit in a row . But I would be surprised to see genuine large-scale bipartisan consensus on this, just because the headcount piece is going to be aggressive, because the regulatory rescissions are very much a Republican interest and not a Democratic one. And I also think there's a political economy problem: the parts of this that are easiest to message to the public are not the improving state capacity parts. We've seen a lot of the Rand Paul-style tweeting from Elon about bad or silly experiments that science agencies fund \u2014 the shrimp running on treadmills stuff \u2014 the $500,000 we spent on this or that. And I think those are easily the easiest part of the DOGE project to sell to the public: \"Look at this science experiment we've described a little cruelly.\" You can get a lot of people on board with cutting that. I think there's a paradox here, where the parts that are easiest to message are the least meaningful fixes or maybe even moving you in the wrong direction. Yeah. And so then on the flip side, DOGE at the end of the day has no formal power of any sort. It is not technically even part of the government. How do you anticipate that playing out? Do you feel like there's actually a path forward where operating from the outside can still have the sort of influence it wants? Or is it the sort of thing that is likely to be a Silicon Valley innovation that is about to run into the reality of how Washington operates? I don't think it's naive or silly. We had a guest recently on Statecraft , Dr. Arun Seraphin , who was on another blue ribbon commission, this one to fix the process by which the Pentagon and Congress hash out the defense budget. And Arun flagged for me that basically the problem with blue ribbon commissions is anybody can make the recommendations, but will the people on the commission go push those recommendations later? Do they have the stature to be effective? And do you have a political moment where those pushes could succeed? I think you have all those in this case. Elon and Vivek are clearly very much bought in on this project and it's been backed by the president. There's a clear kind of political mandate. There's political cover here in a way that plenty of blue ribbon commissions never get. And there's a megaphone here, right? The two co-heads can go directly to the public in a way that plenty of experts and PhDs on blue ribbon commissions can't or don't. So I think there's a lot of room. I don't think the room is limitless, but I don't think it's the West Coast coming in and thinking it can easily fix the way the East Coast works. I think there's a little bit more going on here than that. That doesn't mean it'll succeed, but I think it's not a fool's errand. Yeah. I can envision a world in which DOGE, in pursuit of what it sees as the big successful effort, has ideas that are not actually in line with what a White House would be interested in advancing at all. Are they worried about that, or should they be worried about that, or do you feel like there's more alignment there on what is in versus out of bounds? I would not be surprised \u2014 and again, this is speculation \u2014 but I would not be surprised if, of the three things that DOGE has said they want to tackle, the regulatory rescissions that are handed off directly to President Trump, recommendations for regulations that can be struck, there's no problem there, and the question is just a legal one about which regulations you can change and how. I'm guessing that roughly the same will be true for the ad"

    "keywords": "Statecraft will be off for the week of Christmas. We\u2019ll see you in 2025! Today, we talk to Jennifer Pahlka and Andrew Greenway about their new paper on state capacity. It\u2019s called \u201c The How We Need Now: A Capacity Agenda for 2025 and Beyond .\u201d What is \u201cstate capacity?\u201d Why is there fresh interest in the topic in the UK? How did the model of a \u201cgovernment digital service\u201d spread to the US? How do you fix unemployment insurance? For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Jennifer Pahlka: The academic definition is just \u201cthe ability of a government to achieve its policy goals.\u201d It's relevant now because we're seeing our lack of ability to do that, even with a robust state and enormous budgets. Andrew Greenway: Over here, state capacity particularly manifests as the translation of political and democratic intent into tangible outcomes that the public can actually feel and see. That may be a stretch. I'm not sure the public is that interested. Jennifer: It is having a bit of a moment. If it\u2019s relevant to the average person these days, it's due to frustration with not feeling tangible outcomes. It\u2019s the disjuncture between hearing, \u201cWe're going to be investing in new infrastructure for clean energy or EV charging stations,\u201d or, \u201cDuring the pandemic, you're going to get your unemployment insurance\u201d and then it doesn't happen, or it doesn't happen in a way that the people who wrote that law really intended. So although I don\u2019t think most of the public knows the phrase, I think they would say it\u2019s important to them if they understood the meaning of it, because at the end of the day, that\u2019s what we all care about. Andrew: In the UK, I think there's probably a bit less discourse around \u201cstate capacity\u201d as a phrase. But it\u2019s definitely coming through, and one reason is that people have gotten quite tired of other phrases. We talk a lot about \u201ccivil service reform\u201d and \u201cpublic service reform\u201d here. Those phrases have maybe not become discredited, but there's an element of weariness with those concepts, partly because people have heard them trotted out for decades and not really seen or felt the difference. Jennifer: I wanted to write about state capacity in the US, but it feels to me like we can\u2019t imagine some of the things that we need to imagine without being able to see it somewhere else. Most of Andrew\u2019s team at Public Digital were part of the Government Digital Service (GDS) in the UK, which came about around 2011, and I\u2019ve always found that they were a bit ahead. They\u2019re actually about to show examples of some of the things we need to do, like closing the loop between policy and implementation. I wanted Andrew to join me so we could move the Overton window for what people are thinking about in the US. Andrew: Us Brits tend to be quiet and polite, so I always feel slightly embarrassed on our behalf when Jen says we\u2019re way ahead. It sometimes doesn't feel like that, but the UK has played a leading role in some of this thinking in the past. As readers may know, we've got a new government here, the first Labour administration in 14 years. They have come to the realization quicker than some governments have, that the system of government is not quite ready or quite fit to deliver the level of ambition that they have. In fact, there was a speech last week by a senior cabinet minister that was laying out some of his intentions around this. Andrew: The new Labour government came into power in July, so they're still relatively early days. One of the ways that they've set themselves up and framed the government was describing themselves as being \u201cmission driven.\u201d They\u2019re leaning on some of the work of Mariana Mazzucato and that \u201centrepreneurial state\u201d side of things. They\u2019ve set these five missions: things like growth, health, crime and so on. But strongly implicit within that was that they were going to approach how they went about things in quite a different way. We wrote a report back in the spring called The Radical How . It put some meat on those bones of what mission-driven government might mean. Looking back primarily in the UK at the good, bad, and ugly of governments delivering complex things, often some common threads appeared in the successful examples: things like taking iterative test and learn approaches, having multidisciplinary teams, and so on. The political context here is, effectively, that this government will have to show people quite quickly that government can do things. This is not so much the usual UK fight of centre-left vs. centre-right, Labour and Conservatives. There's a growing sense that people don't buy either of those shades, because neither of them has stepped up and delivered what people perceive as real progress. This government is staking quite a lot on delivering something tangible \u2014 in effect to rebuild trust in politics and institutions \u2014 and as a guard against populism. We have a harder right party, Reform, which is gaining in polls, and is essentially trading on this government inability, left or right, to do things. This government is framing a lot of its work around Reform, countering that and showing the difference. Andrew, in the UK has civil service reform been a similarly right-of-center interest historically? Andrew: Yeah, the work I did as a public servant helping set up the Government Digital Service: that came in under a centre-right government that our minister at the time, a guy called Francis Maude drove that. But he approached that problem with quite an intentionally cross-party perspective. Effectively you had the three biggest parties in the UK, either in government or with very recent experience in government, that had all collectively come to the same conclusion that the state of affairs wasn't working. We\u2019d just spent the thick end of 12 billion on a healthcare IT system that spectacularly broke. That's not a partisan issue. That's just a sense that the system is not delivering here. And I think here as well, the debate is perhaps less framed in terms of left and right. I think there's quite a strong center around this that spans the parties, but it's a debate almost about people and systems. So there's a guy here, Dominic Cummings, who's got flavors of Musk about him, who I think would argue that \u201cActually, there are thousands of officials who've just been throwing sand into the gears. We need to get rid of a hell of a lot of people, just properly shake this up, effectively cull quite a lot of the public service. \u201cWe need some more technologists in the room and let's move it forward.\u201d Versus those who go, \u201cThat's not wholly untrue, but equally there's some fundamental structural things we need to do about incentives within the system that get the most out of the talent that we've got in public service.\u201d Jennifer: Before I answer that, I just want to say one quick thing about your last question: I don't think Schedule F is civil service reform. We need civil service reform of the kind they're talking about in the UK: making it possible to hire on the basis of merit, fire underperformers, promote the right folks. That\u2019s all a merit-based system. I think Schedule F is very different territory. But about the Brits: A pillar in this paper is that we have to be able to close the loop between policy and implementation. That's illustrated by this metaphor of a waterfall vs. an agile loop. The way it works today is you pass a law, write a policy, and it goes into this machinery of government. It's a hierarchy in which work descends through the layers.There's really no affordance for feedback in the middle, as you're doing the implementation, both for checking with the folks who wrote it about their intent, but also for the teams to explain to the folks who wrote it, \u201cThis is what we're learning while we're implementing it. If we do this thing that seemed like the right thing, in fact, we're going to get a very perverse outcome.\u201d Andrew\u2019s report The Radical How has a really fantastic example of a team in the UK closing the loop. You have this quite complex policy, Universal Credit , that has to do with combining a number of social benefits together into one. Their small cross-disciplinary team did a hard reboot on it in a way that's far beyond what we've been able to see in the US so far. They had the minister responsible for the department in the room with implementers. Those implementers had done user research earlier that week showing that a particular policy edge case created a benefits cliff for somebody who needed this benefit [ a benefits cliff is a sudden decrease in benefits that occurs when a person's income increases ]. They showed that artifact of user research to the minister and the minister said, \u201cYes, that's wrong. Let's change it.\u201d That is closing the loop. That is testing and learning in a way that's going to get you a policy that actually gets the outcome you intended. I really want us to be aspiring to that level of tight feedback loops. Andrew : Universal Credit was the combination of a bunch of working-age benefits into one. It was effectively the biggest domestic policy of the administration from 2010 to 2015. Andrew: That's exactly right. They initially approached that problem through a very typical traditional government lens: The minister had an idea. He gave it to some smart people. They turn that into a lot of policy requirements and regulations. They then tried to convert them into a bunch of technical requirements. They then chucked them over the wall to the usual outsourcers to try and build this thing. After three years, they'd spent about half a billion dollars and got quite a lot of paperwork, and not a single user had tested this thing. There were red flags all over the place. There was a hard reset called at that point. They started again: New building, new team, multidisciplinary, not that many people, maybe 30-odd people in the room, even fewer to start with. They started by building an end-to-end prototype of the service, and tested it with a very small number of people in a specific part of the country. They looked at that test, learned a bunch of stuff, went back out, and incrementally tested it with larger populations of people over greater regions, and eventually scaled the service nationally. The real proof of the pudding in Universal Credit was during COVID in 2020: overnight, there were millions of additional people claiming this benefit. Universal Credit saw a 12x in the scale of demand without falling over. But they were also changing the policy, changing the actual rules behind that service, as well as the operations on a daily basis in those first three or four weeks when it was really crazy. They could do that because they set the whole thing up on that footing from the get-go. To use a Sherlock Holmes metaphor, it's one of the dogs that didn't bark during COVID. It worked, and people didn't notice, because people expected it to work. Jennifer: Let me not throw our country under the bus entirely: we had some benefits programs that did pretty well. We offered SNAP benefits to kids who couldn\u2019t get meals from school. Many states chose to deliver those automatically without making people apply, and I think that worked relatively well. But, yes, famously, a big one was unemployment insurance because the pandemic threw so many people out of work. Every state developed a pretty enormous backlog of claims. I happened to work on one, the unemployment insurance crisis in California, where we had a 1.3 million claim backlog. Pulling up the hood and looking at how those systems really worked was shocking. Jennifer: Most people think the problem here is that a lot of these systems are written in COBOL. That is somewhat true: there is COBOL in the bottom archaeological layers of these IT systems, and layers that have accrued on top of that over the years. But the problem really is just outdated processes that don't make sense anymore and really have never been challenged. Those archaeological layers of technology all map to archaeological layers of policy and process that have come down from the Department of Labor, the state itself, the courts, and the decisions they've made. One of the things we found out is that, in order to be competent at processing a claim in California, you need to have worked there for something like 17 years. So they\u2019d hired all of these people. I think at the time that I had started, they'd hired 5,000 contractors, mostly through Deloitte, to come in and help process these claims. They didn't seem to be aware that not only practically but legally, those people could not process claims. Jennifer: The legal part of it is that there are provisions in state law, and I think this is true in many states, that reserve that kind of work for what's called merit staff. You're not allowed to have somebody outside come and do that, for two reasons. One is, it's a safeguard against people trying to do something that's crazy complex without the training. And the other thing is, I think the unions put that in, essentially for job security. But these people have great job security! We were pulling people back out of retirement as fast as we could, to get people in the door there. But on a practical basis, you're talking about having to know many distinct systems that don't work in intuitive ways whatsoever, and a lot of rules and hacks and workarounds to process a claim. Now, if a claim was deemed to be valid, it actually sailed through. I don't want to undersell that we got out some ridiculously high number of claims, but the ones that were the problem are the ones that had to get handled by claims processors in a non-automatic way. The really scary thing about it was how we decided \u2014 or how the system decided\u2014whether you got that special handling. If there was a concern that you were not who you said you were, you got that handling. The way the system ran, you got flagged for additional identity verification if there was any mismatch between your name, Social Security number, date of birth, and what's in the Social Security database and other databases that we check against. Think about the IDs that match perfectly. They're the ones auto-submitted by folks who have gotten lots of data off the dark web. When an application is submitted by computers, it's absolutely going to say \u201cJennifer L. Pahlka\u201d because it's going to get my Social Security number right. The ones that got flagged for additional processing were the ones in which people forgot, say, to put their middle initial. Humans make mistakes. Computers don't. We saw all of these very valid claims getting flagged for additional processing, whereas the ones that went in perfectly because they were submitted by bots, through fraudulent crime rings, sailed right through. This is a big reason we had that enormous problem with not only poor service delivery where legitimate claimants were waiting many months for their check, but also enormous fraud. Jennifer: I think unemployment insurance is just an example of literally decades of neglect. People who run unemployment insurance systems in states have been subject to enormous criticism over the years. Essentially, whenever there's a dip in economic activity, which creates more unemployment and they have a surge in claims, they get highly criticized for backlogs. But in the normal years, nobody wants to invest in them. Nobody wants to spend the time understanding how they're broken. If they get any attention, it's for a fraudulent claim. So the culture \u2014 you could really feel it in the Employment Development Department in California \u2014 is so afraid of fraud. The sad and ironic thing is that fear of fraud pushes them to be very defensive of the systems that they use today, these processes like flagging you if you miss your middle initial. In order to avoid the criticism of having opened this up to fraud, which actually opens us up to fraud. We get more fraud because we make public servants so defensive, and the only thing they have to stand behind to defend themselves is existing processes that don't work. But we really need to get in there with the air cover from elected officials, from leaders with power saying, \"Let's stop the blame game and care, not just about the policy that's been passed, but about the mechanics and the talent and the procedures that we're relying on to deliver these policies.\" We just completely tune those out between crises. If you assume that there will always be some sources of pressure on civil servants from that perspective, how do you avoid putting them in this position where they're creating more bureaucratic process and difficulty for the correct recipients of these benefits? Jennifer: I think we think about fraud fundamentally as incompetence on the part of a state agency, instead of the result of years of layering on mandates and constraints. It shouldn't take 17 years to learn how to process a claim for unemployment insurance. In its basic conception, it\u2019s just not that hard. Legislators need to learn to subtract as much as they add, and they need to learn to think differently about oversight. Oversight's really important: I'm not calling for less oversight. I'm calling for a very different kind of oversight. Not, \"Oh, look, we got a bad outcome. Let's go have an outrage hearing.\" But, \"Let's understand the many mandates and constraints we've placed on this agency, which makes it so hard for them to operate in a way that's competent, in a way that can actually deal in a 2024 kind of way with fraud.\" Andrew: The Brit in me is desperate to qualify how good we are, by explaining that it's not all that great. One of the really important things about Universal Credit is that it got to a point where a crisis was declared. There was a point at which everybody realized, both politically and officially, \"We've got to get ourselves out of this.\" I say that because it's certainly still true here in the UK that this kind of working does happen here now and again, but it\u2019s by exception. It's because of exceptional circumstances and usually exceptional leaders who drive reform through despite the wider structural pressures, be they the perceptions around fraud, be they even the natural inclinations around internal governance where the inclination is, \"Oh, we'll have a program steering board on this thing every six weeks and a lot of papers will get written for it.\" Instead, let's get the minister and the senior officials who are responsible for this whole thing in the room with the team, and the team can show them what they've built this week, and then they can show them the user research and you make the decisions based on that. Andrew: I was incredibly lucky to join the Government Digital Service at the time that I did, because, hands up, I'm a generalist. I'm one of those dangerous people. I was a young, ambitious civil servant. I could have easily gone to the dark side. I guess the simplest way of describing the GDS team members is that they were just formidably smart, but in completely different ways. You were sitting alongside developers, service designers, people who wrote well for the web, user researchers, genuine deep practitioners in what they did and what they do. And you were collectively brought around an outcome that you were there to deliver. My job as a more policy guy wasn't to write the policy paper. My job was to work with the other people in my team to deliver whatever the overall outcome of the thing that we were shooting for. That seems super basic really, and it is. There's a lot of this recognized practice in many parts of the private sector, but that just didn't happen in government. That's partly because obviously you get these tribes in the silos, things getting tossed over walls to the other. But there's also some quite interesting stuff about power dynamics between those worlds too. Certainly in the UK, the generalists and the policy types or the Treasury economist f"

Before you tune out, give us a chance: the two court cases we\u2019re discussing could have huge ramifications for how we build things in America. We brought three of our favorite administrative law professors together for an admin law party. Talking to them felt like opening the door to the faculty break room and overhearing today\u2019s gossip. Do they agree on everything? No, as you\u2019ll see. Brief intros: James Coleman is a professor at the University of Minnesota, specializing in energy infrastructure, transport , and trade. He has testified before Congress on how to speed up energy infrastructure permits. Adam White is the Executive Director of the Gray Center for the Study of the Administrative State at George Mason University. He has practiced constitutional and regulatory law in D.C., with a special focus on energy infrastructure regulation. Several years ago, we were colleagues at the American Enterprise Institute. Nicholas Bagley is a professor at the University of Michigan and was Chief General Counsel to Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer . We\u2019ve discussed a law review article he wrote called The Procedure Fetish , about the problems with the procedures we\u2019ve created for federal agencies. He recently joined Statecraft to discuss How Bureaucracy is Breaking Government . Why the National Environmental Policy Act is a problem How a small White House office grew to wield power Congress never gave it Why a seemingly simple environmental case has thrown environmental regulations into doubt Why D.C. appellate lawyers don\u2019t challenge laws they believe are wrong The potential for reforming environmental review This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity by Harry Fletcher-Wood. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Santi Ruiz: We're going to be talking about a recent case before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, Marin Audubon Society v. FAA . To explain that case, I have a word bank in my notes. James, will you explain what \u201cNEPA\u201d is? James Coleman : The National Environmental Policy Act is America\u2019s principal environmental review law. It was signed on January 1st, 1970, so it's been in place for over 50 years. NEPA says the government is supposed to consider the environmental consequences of any project that it permits or funds. NEPA has developed over time to require more and more review. When it was passed, it was supposed to be a relatively simple \u201clook before you leap\u201d kind of statute. The United States grew tremendously after the end of World War II, and built most of the infrastructure that we still rely on to this day. If you look at the interstates we use, most of them were built in that 25-year post-war period. The crude oil pipelines that we still use are more than 50 years old on average: most of them were built in that post-war period. There was a concern that all of that construction had impacts on the communities that it went through. As an example, my grandmother grew up in a predominantly African American neighborhood in St. Paul called the Rondo neighborhood . It was bulldozed to bring I-94 through the middle of St. Paul. So the NEPA idea was, we need some kind of \u201clook before we leap\u201d statute that says the federal government has to consider these environmental impacts before it goes forward. Over time, with a series of decisions in the \u201870s and into the \u201880s, the federal courts dramatically expanded what was required under NEPA. Environmental groups found that this was an amazing tool to potentially stop new infrastructure projects: If the federal government had not considered some environmental issue to the extent that the courts thought it should be considered, the court would issue an injunction and stop the whole project. That could delay a project for years, because not only would it have to wait for its initial environmental review, but then that review would be stopped by the courts until it was fixed by the agency. Then, to avoid injunctions from the courts, the federal government started to take longer and longer to do more comprehensive reviews. They were initially done in a matter of months, but eventually took over five years on average. Santi: To clarify, as a private citizen or a non-profit, I could point to the NEPA review that your agency did, and \u2014 even though I'm not the owner of the land being built on \u2014 I could bring a case under NEPA? James : That's right. There still is a standing requirement. You have to show some kind of injury, but that injury could be to some environmental benefit: you enjoy birdwatching in these woods, for example. Those standing requirements are typically relaxed in the context of these procedural statutes. Congress wanted everybody to be able to take advantage of asking for more consideration of these issues. The courts have been relatively generous in that context. One thing it's very important to keep in mind is that even as the district courts and federal courts of appeals have been very generous in interpreting this statute to benefit people who want to stop infrastructure projects, the Supreme Court has not been. SCOTUS has only taken 17 cases, and it's about to hear another case on the National Environmental Policy Act. That's less than one case every three years. But there've been hundreds of NEPA cases every year in the lower courts that tend to interpret it very broadly, whereas the federal government has won in every Supreme Court decision. The Supreme Court has said that the federal government did plenty of review here. In fact, in many of those decisions, most of which were unanimous, the Supreme Court has said, \u201cLower courts, knock it off. Stop requiring so much from the federal government. We need some of these projects to go through.\u201d So there's been a bit of a disconnect between the way the National Environmental Policy Act is generally interpreted: very aggressively in the district courts and circuit courts, and more reasonably, or aligned with the original intent of the law, by SCOTUS. Santi: What's the layman's explanation for that? Why have lower courts been so much more generous with their reading of the law than the Supreme Court? James : If you read those early decisions, they're very clear that they want to implement the policy of the National Environmental Policy Act, which \u2014 they say \u2014 is designed to be protective. In fact, if you go back and read the National Environmental Policy Act, some parts of it are almost anti-civilization, concerned about human population growth. But the [ lower ] courts seemed to want to interpret that very aggressively. And it's partly about a disconnect that opened up between the Supreme Court, which was focusing in that period more on ideas like textualism [ interpreting the law based on its text, rather than legislators\u2019 intentions or the problem it was intended to address ] and limiting to what the law actually said. The lower courts were still inspired by the Warren Supreme Court in the \u201850s and \u201860s, and were focusing more on implementing the statute\u2019s purpose by interpreting the National Environmental Policy Act very broadly. Santi: Adam, let me ask you to explain the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and how it came up in this recent case. Adam White : The Council on Environmental Quality is, broadly speaking, part of the White House. It's actually across the street in a nice little townhouse office in Lafayette Square. It has been the White House unit responsible for implementing NEPA for a long time. The crux of the D.C. Circuit case is that CEQ's power is not a function of statute, at least not in terms of administering NEPA. Yes, CEQ was created by NEPA. But its power to create the rules governing the implementation of NEPA by the agencies is the product of an executive order. I think it's important to put CEQ's founding in the context of the 1960s and 1970s. You saw the rise of broad, cross-agency environmental statutes: NEPA, the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Coastal Zone Management Act. You also saw a building out of the White House structure, partly by the White House and partly by Congress. Around the same time as CEQ was created in 1969, you saw the rise of the Office of Management and Budget, which had roots way back in the FDR administration, but came into its modern form in the second half of the 20th century. You saw the White House building out or refining things like the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs , the National Security Council, and the National Economic Council. CEQ is not quite the same as those: it is, in its origin, a creature of statute. But you've seen its form and function change over time as more authority was layered onto it, formally through executive orders, but also informally. I remember during the Obama administration when you had the blackouts in New York , suddenly you had CEQ in the middle of the response, trying to help keep the lights on. Above all, with the rise of climate change as a major policy subject, CEQ's authority and its influence has grown exponentially, because of its cross-agency power and its literal and legal proximity to the presidency. Santi: Up until this Marin Audubon case, which has thrown CEQ's role into question, what has its managerial function over other agencies been? Adam : One is the promulgation of regulations that implement NEPA administration-wide. But downstream of that, CEQ has promulgated guidance, or sometimes draft guidance, trying to further explain and refine the application of NEPA and the regulations in particular contexts, especially in climate. I would consider those its most important powers. A lot of it is the soft power of having a centralized traffic cop on these issues so close to the presidency. Santi: Can you give me an example of how that might work? Let's say I'm an agency working on some major action and you're CEQ. Talk me through that dynamic. Adam : Nick might be better at that. He's actually served in government whereas I just sit outside and complain about it. But let\u2019s distinguish CEQ from agencies like OIRA. CEQ is not as directly related in as many specific agency actions. NEPA applies anytime an agency wants to do anything that could have a major, reasonably foreseeable impact on the environment, or when the agency is granting or denying a permit for private infrastructure projects that could have those environmental impacts. CEQ does not actually dig into every specific application the way OIRA does. CEQ's role has been much more at the across-the-board lawmaking level: it creates regulations or proposes guidance documents that will inform all agencies\u2019 work. But I don't think it actually gets deeply involved in discrete infrastructure permitting decisions. CEQ is more of a planning body, planning the broad regulatory process. Nicholas Bagley : Starting in about 1977, CEQ started to issue those rules of the road through what in administrative law circles we call \u201clegislative rules.\u201d What that means is that the guidance CEQ issued would go through notice and comment [ the formal rulemaking procedure required by the Administrative Procedure Act, requiring the agency to respond to comments on the proposed rules ] and would be published in the Federal Register. That gave the rules a veneer of formality. These rules looked not just like, \u201cHey, this is how CEQ thinks about NEPA, agencies should take that into account when they act.\u201d Now, the big step was that courts saw them as formally binding the agencies and enforceable in court. CEQ regulations have grown increasingly complex over time. They require, among other things, notice and comment and extensive analysis of alternatives. They lay out a bunch of categorical exclusions [ categories of action considered to have limited impact on the environment. These actions receive streamlined review ]. They're also used to advance the sitting administration's priorities. Under the Biden administration, CEQ regulations have required agencies to take into account environmental justice and indigenous knowledge . CEQ has been blamed for contributing to the punitive length of environmental impact statements, which are now many hundreds of pages long and take many years to complete. Whether CEQ is in fact the primary driver of most of the NEPA work agencies do is contested. But they've certainly contributed to the burdens. Adam : I would just add: CEQ isn't the only agency that's making regulations under NEPA. FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is responsible for regulating electricity markets, interstate natural gas pipelines, and certain interstate electricity corridors. FERC has its own body of regulations implementing NEPA at an even more granular level, tailored towards FERC's substantive jurisdiction. The other agencies, the Army Corps of Engineers and others all have their own body of NEPA regs. Santi: So any federal agency dealing with NEPA has its own internal regulatory system that it's working through, as well as this overarching, theoretically binding CEQ framework. Nicholas : I'll turn that up a ratchet. If you're an executive branch agency, the CEQ regulations are not \u201ctheoretically binding.\u201d They are binding on you, as a matter of executive branch internal governance. When the White House says to its agencies, \u201cWe want you to do X, Y, or Z,\u201d that's a direct order from the president. If you serve at the pleasure of the president, you follow through on that. That's true whether or not these CEQ regulations are legislative rules that apply in the courts. Santi: I think most of us non-lawyers will be very confused by that last sentence. Nicholas : This is one you have to really try to wrap your head around. One of the reasons that NEPA has become so fearsome is because it is enforceable in the courts. An environmental group, for example, will sue an agency that's trying to get a development off the ground. They will say that the agency has \u201cfailed to consider an alternative that would have mitigated the environmental consequences,\u201d or failed to examine an alternative deeply enough. If a court agrees that the agency has failed to take into account an important aspect of the problem, the court will blow up the agency action and send the agency back to the drawing board. That can be immensely disruptive to what an agency wants to do. In response, agencies spend a lot of time trying to cover their butts so that they can withstand eventual court review. The issue in the Marin County case is whether the CEQ regulations are binding in court. What I mean is, when environmental groups bring these lawsuits, they sometimes say, \u201cLook, the agency failed to abide by the CEQ regulations, and that is part of the reason we think that their action should be stopped.\u201d Because those CEQ regulations are on the books and look pretty formal, over the past 45 years or so, courts have looked at those and said, \u201cHey, we can enforce those CEQ regulations. They're regulations, after all.\u201d The issue in the Marin County case is, is it appropriate for the courts to enforce the CEQ rules? But that's an entirely separate question from whether agencies must follow the CEQ regulations as a matter of what the executive branch says they have to do. When the president gives you an order, you have to follow that order. That's true whether or not the courts are going to enforce it. So you want to keep those two things distinct: a set of CEQ regulations that are going to bind the agencies as a matter of internal executive branch governance, no matter what, and CEQ regulations that would be enforceable by the courts if agencies fail to live up to them. One of the ironies of NEPA is that it doesn't even mention judicial review. It was meant as an internal executive branch management tool, in the late 1960s, before the courts took a hard look at what agencies did. When Congress adopted it, there was no expectation that the courts would change their practice. But it was adopted as the D.C. Circuit was intensifying judicial scrutiny . So the D.C. Circuit takes this law, which was meant to be about internal executive branch management, and retrofits it to suit the needs of the time. This was really not the original understanding of what NEPA was all about. Santi: Let's go back to the Marin Audubon case with all that in mind. What happened there? Nicholas : The case involves what are called Air Tour Management Plans . If you have a national park, you want to make sure you're setting appropriate rules for flights that go over the park: tours to see parts of the park you otherwise couldn't see, by airplane or by helicopter. These tours have a lot of noise implications and may have pollution implications. You want to make sure that whenever they're going over the park, they're abiding by certain rules to protect sensitive wildlife and environmental areas. The Air Tour Management Plan in question involves four national park areas in the San Francisco area. This plan authorized about 2,500 commercial airline and helicopter flights to pass over four national park areas. When the Federal Aviation Administration developed the Air Tour Management Plan, it said, '\u2019NEPA is on the books, but we actually don't need to do an environmental impact statement to consider the effects of these flights.\u201d Why? Because there's a CEQ regulation that says that any changes or amendments to an existing sort of state of affairs don\u2019t need to go through NEPA if they only have minimal environmental impacts. CEQ regulations say agencies don't need to consider anything that has minimal environmental impact through the whole NEPA process. A bunch of environmentalists out west sued the FAA and said, \u201cYou can't just ignore your NEPA obligations by saying you've currently got 2,500 flights going through those areas and you're not making any changes, therefore you don't need to do an environmental impact statement.\u201d They said, \u201cThe right baseline is thinking about the question from scratch. What's the consequence of allowing any flights to go through those areas and how do you think about that problem? We don't think it was appropriate for you to use that categorical exclusion to avoid your NEPA obligations here.\u201d Santi: And the D.C. Circuit Court dodged that small question and answered a much bigger question. James : This is the question that has been implicit for almost 50 years. CEQ issued these regulations in 1978, and they have often been treated as binding regulations by the court. If you look at all those aggressive court decisions that said, \u201cNow the agencies have to consider this and that and this other factor,\u201d they often cited CEQ regulations, because some of the most prominent regulations say, \u201cNot only do you have to consider the impacts of this federally-approved or funded project, you also have to consider the indirect impacts and the cumulative impacts of that project.\u201d Typically, CEQ regulations and all the decisions that have been based on them cite these three kinds of impacts. Direct impacts : you're bulldozing a neighborhood for a highway project. Indirect impacts are less well-defined. Presumably, it means something beyond what the actual project or the part that is approved is doing directly. If you're approving a power line to cross a specific stream, maybe the indirect impact is all of the rest of the power line that's going to be enabled by this project, or all the new wind turbines that are going to be built as a result. It could extend to all industrial activity that's enabled by all the electricity produced by those wind turbines. To identify the cumulative impacts , you take those direct and indirect impacts, and then consider how they relate to other ones. Maybe there'll be other power lines being built, and we don't have one big opportunity to approve all of those projects. So maybe in this one environmental impact statement for a single water crossing, we should"

He just abruptly had a moment of panic and realized that he proclaimed martial law. Because there were neither secret nor non-secret events that justified it, as soon as he proclaimed it, basically none of the authorities moved to implement it. Then there was a parliamentary reaction, a popular reaction, and obviously, he will either resign or be resigned, one of the two. I don't know what happened. It could have been a purely personal nervous breakdown. Now, it is a nervous breakdown in the context where the national capital is within rocket range of North Korea, and where there are supposedly preparations for national emergency and a provision for martial law in order to respond to a sudden North Korean attack. There have been North Korean attacks in the past, including one that penetrated the presidential Blue House complex and killed the wife of then-ruler Park Chung-hee. So we don't know. It could be a private psychiatric event. It could be a piece of information that reached him directly without being filtered by professionals, and which he took upon himself to view as a warning of an imminent all-out attack. Well, I don't think they have changed at all. If you look carefully at the structure of recent events, you see that they haven't changed. Every state has to have a security apparatus \u2014 military, non-military, police, security services. Those organizations are depicted in organizational charts as if they were machines. But they're not machines, they're run by people. Each of these organizations and sub-organizations has a chief. Now that chief may be a commanding figure, whose every word is implemented without question, or it could be simply the head who was appointed a week ago or something. Either way. But it is evident that the coup d'\u00e9tat is a specific way of changing governance, and that is not to attack the state as a whole from the outside, not to attack the state from launching attacks on government ministries and palaces, as an enemy might do, but simply a process whereby these people who run the actual active elements of the state \u2014 which is, let's say, that armored brigade, which is close to the capital city, the police, the gendarmerie if there's a separate gendarmerie, everybody with guns in their hands \u2014 can intervene physically. If you can coordinate them, then, mechanically speaking, you can take over the headquarters of the government: the presidential palace, the prime minister's office, whatever it is. You can do that. You can shut down the mass media. And you can stop the internet because the internet operates from specific physical facilities. You can just open a door, enter there, and switch it off. You are now free to call in your media, or the media generally, and make your statement: because of the intolerable abuses and misbehavior of the previous ruler, we, the committee of national salvation, have taken over, and so on. Even if it is only one individual who runs everything, he never presents himself: \u201cI took over.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cThe National Salvation Committee, of which I'm the humble secretary,\u201d or chairman or whatever. Then you denounce the previous government and announce wonderful useful reform measures that people have been calling for. You stop all flights, you control the airport. And then you say, \u201cIn order to ensure everybody's safety, there are checkpoints: please don't cross the checkpoints unless you're willing to present yourself and say you have to take a child to hospital and things of that sort.\u201d And you stabilize the situation. While everything is stabilized, you go and arrest all the political leaders that could challenge you: all the ones that might stand up and speak in front of a group of people or a camera or microphone. You arrest them and you just physically detain them, perhaps to be liberated in a day or so with apologies, perhaps to be killed on the spot \u2014 anything in between. Those mechanics of the coup have not changed. I'm now going to offer you a megalomaniac explanation of the course of events. I wrote my book in '67, published in '68. My book was a response to a great number of coups in Africa, which followed inevitably from the fact that African states became independent in the early 1960s. By 1965, they were ready for military coups, and in the Middle East there were lots of coups. I was tracking events there because at that time I was employed by Walter J. Levy of London, the chief political advisor of big oil companies like Shell [ In World War II, Levy led the petroleum section of the Office of Strategic Services or OSS, the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency. ] I was reading about coups. What I did is I tried to distill the mechanics of the coup. All coups are different, but they're all the same, because all of them depend on taking hold, not of the nation, but simply of the repressive machinery of the state. So I wrote a description of how to do that. My first words are \u201cOverthrowing governments is not easy,\u201d and I tell you how to do it step by step. Now for the megalomaniac explanation for what happened next, which was a very rapid decline in the number of coups. Coups had been very common until about two years after the book was published, and then stopped. The reason is that authorities everywhere reverse-engineered the book. The book was published in English, and it was immediately translated into about 13 languages. It went all over the place. I think what happened is that people learned to reverse engineer. So, you have an armored mobile force, which is near the capital. I say, \u201cMake sure either you move it 400 kilometers away, as far away as you can, or else make sure that it's commanded by your son or nephew or something like that.\u201d So they did that, they put their nephews in charge of any mobile force. My book caused a decline of coups. For example, King Hassan II of Morocco was the victim of a coup. His airplane was to be shot down coming back from Paris, but he landed and became very energetic, took control of the airbase, and then eventually tracked down the organizer of the coup, who was the minister of the interior, General Mohamed Oufkir. [ According to King Hassan\u2019s New York Times obituary , \u201cWhen pilots of his air force attacked his Boeing 727 jetliner, the King, himself a pilot, seized the radio and shouted, \u2018Stop firing! The tyrant is dead!\u2019 \u2014 fooling the rebels into breaking off their attack.\u201d ] Now, there is a Hamletic, Shakespearean turn in this, because Oufkir was in fact a devoted, devoted servant of the royal house, who had served the previous king, the heroic Mohammed V, heroically and most deservedly. Hassan II became a reckless and open playboy who in fact was flying back from Paris from another couple of weeks cavorting with the elegant ladies who take money for their services. Oufkir wanted to kill Hassan so that another member of the royal family would come in, someone who was not a playboy and would be serious and determined and courageous and all these other things. Ironically, when Hassan landed after the attempt to have his plane shot down, he proved exactly that. He immediately went and got a few people, rounded up the pilots, and then came to town and did everything that Oufkir had wanted the heir of the throne to do. But he, of course, entered Oufkir's office and shot him. Oufkir bled to death, and he did so over a copy of my book. The minister of the interior, Dlimi was his name, promised to give me this copy of the book, which I really needed, obviously. But then what happened is that he tried a coup, and before he could deliver the book to me \u2014 because evidently he read the book \u2014 instead, before he could deliver it to me, he was killed as well. After that, there was great tranquility over the Moroccan throne to this day. [ Officially, Minister Dlimi died in a car crash. However, allegations have been made that he was assassinated. ] But the Syrian regime of Hafez al-Assad definitely did everything that you would have done if you understood coups and you knew how to reverse-engineer them. Now, what happened is that reverse engineering also is beginning to fail, because they came up with reverse engineering to protect against my depiction of coups, and then they didn't change it. Then came change, all manner of things change, so the reverse engineering is beginning to fail. Because it was predicated on the need to kill Hassan in order to preserve the royal family by having somebody else who was not the reckless playboy, a languid playboy who got up at 11 o'clock in the morning and couldn't do anything. But when Hassan almost died aboard that jet returning from France, almost shot down by the F-5 fighters of the Moroccan Air Force, he lands there, and he doesn\u2019t go crying or hiding. He gathers up cadets or wherever it is there, gets weapons, takes a weapon himself, and personally leads them. They take over the base and march down, arrive at Oufkir's headquarters, walk in and shoot him there. So Oufkir succeeded! Because, as I say, his motivation was lifelong loyalty to the royal house and seeing it collapse into weakness and about to be overthrown and become a government like Algeria or something, because of the king's failure to be a man like his father had been. Well, the king became a man! And this is very much like Shakespeare. Remember, the one that ends up in Agincourt. It begins with the young king being a playboy. No, that would be Henry V. It's the apogee of Henry V. You mean a favorite coup? No, I have a string of coups that I like, where the coup leaders maintain the promise of straightening something up, and making it work. There have been cases of it, coups that were better. Paradoxically, one of those coups is the coup that is universally condemned, which is the coup in Myanmar. There was an election. Somebody won the election and this whole complex of military and police came in and took over. The fact of the matter is that the military was defending the country from two different, equally dangerous enemies. One is the Chinese takeover of the country, which the military had resisted. The military gave them permission to have a pipeline . They didn't give them permission to do many other things. And the other is the fragmentation of the country because of secessionist tribal movements. National movements, tribal movements, religious movements of many different ilks and varieties, but the largest ones are all under Chinese influence. There are these rebels that exist on the border of China's Yunnan province in Myanmar. Now supposedly they're bandits and criminals, the guerrillas. They\u2019re driven over the Chinese border and the next thing you see is the rebel leaders having tea with the local Chinese police. So the military that fights those rebels is trying to keep the country together. As for the political movements, they are indeed democratic and the military did suppress democracy. However, the fact of the matter is that they do not have the operational capability to keep the country together. So things are not so clear cut. Well, you just said it. For example, when Nasrallah said that Israel is weaker than a spider's web, he believed that, and originally saw that Israelis were sentimental about casualties. He was not. When 200 Hezbollah people died, well, you know, the families did get death benefits, but that was it. That's correct, all that kind of stuff. And of course, Israel's enemies have always been very confident. In 1948, on the eve of the first war, in 1947, the head of the Arab League, Rahman Azzam Pasha , an Egyptian \u2014 who was, by the way, far from a cruel person, not at all, he was a humane gentleman \u2014 he gravely warned the Jews that this would be a massacre, a great massacre, like the ones inflicted by the Mongols, the ones of the Middle Ages and so on. They were sure they were going to win. And they had a reason to. The British Foreign Office made sure that the Israelis had no weapons. The State Department enthusiastically backed them, and so Israel had no weapons. They didn't have weapons before because it was a British mandatory territory, not an independent state. When they became independent, the State Department and the British, who were then all-powerful in the immediate aftermath of World War II, imposed a total blockade. Being disarmed, they were obviously going to lose the war, because the British had armed the Egyptians and the Jordanians and the French had armed the Syrians with tanks, airplanes, and things like that. But they overlooked a simple fact, which is that even though the Israelis were less than 700,000, they were in fact modern people and acted like modern people. They tried everything. They managed to get weapons from Czechoslovakia, from the non-Jewish Zionists, which have always been present in Prague from the 1920s. The saintly president of Czechoslovakia, Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk , was an enthusiastic Zionist, and they remained in power until the communist takeover in 1948. When Stalin took over, he continued to deliver weapons because he wanted to embarrass the British. That's how they won, with weapons. The Anglo-Americans controlled the whole Mediterranean, but the Israelis were able to fly in weapons from Prague with DC-3s, which are small, two-engine, piston-engine transports, just enough to win the war, because modern people with weapons win wars. They didn't need as many weapons as the other side had. No, no, no. Israel has no conflict with Iran at all. What happened is that the Iranian theocrats that run Iran, these long-robed priests and the unshaven revolutionary guards, decided that Persian Iran, Shia Iran, is going to take over the Arab Sunni world by being more anti-Israeli than they could ever be. \u201cYou are anti-Israel, yes, but we hate the Jews more than you do.\u201d In fact, to this day, the Iranian state funds a Holocaust cartoon festival every year. There are people around the world, in places like Uruguay, who have made money by making cartoons, making fun of the Holocaust. Anybody listening to this who is a good cartoonist, you know, he can make money by doing it. So, \u201cWe are more anti-Jewish than you are. We are more anti the state of Israel than you are. That's why we should be the leaders of the whole Middle East.\u201d That is the Shia Persian power wanting to dominate the Arabs because they think Arabs are lizard eaters, in other words, desert dwellers who are stupid. They're not Persians. In fact, one of the 17 errors of the Obama-Biden approach to Iran was that when some Arab Shia militia, following orders from Tehran, launched a rocket against Americans in tiny bases in Jordan and Iraq and so on, then the US would retaliate against those militias. But of course, the Persians consider Arabs expendable. If you go to Iran at a dinner party and say, \u201cHezbollah has lost another 5,000 people today,\u201d they say, \u201cOh well, pass the next course.\u201d Israel has no quarrel with Iran. Iran has no quarrel with Israel. It's simply that Israel had to be attacked, because that is how Persians could dominate the Middle East. That\u2019s how the Shia can dominate even though most of the Arab population is Sunni. Any Sunni Arab who sides with Iran is a fool, proving the deepest belief of the Persians, which is that the Arabs are intellectually inferior, easily manipulated. Historically Persians and Jews have always cooperated against everybody else. When the Shah cooperated with the State of Israel, he was simply doing what every previous Persian ruler ever did whenever there was a Jewish anything going on. In fact, even today, after all these years, there is one fact that every Sunni Arab should have noticed and acted upon, but they didn't. And that is that all the Jewish communities in the Muslim world have disappeared. From Morocco, there is a remnant, in spite of the fact that the Moroccan government was never anti-Jewish, and is not now anti-Jewish. In Tunisia, there are two families. The other communities have simply disappeared. There were communities in Tripolitania, Cyrenaica, Libya, and Egypt, and even as far as Penang Island of Malaya. In Penang, the main road is still called Jalan Cohen, named after the man who ended malaria in Penang. [ NB: I cannot confirm the existence of this road. There was a Yehudi Road in Penang that has since been renamed. ] There was a strong, important Jewish community. They've all gone. The only one existing is in Iran, where they live completely unmolested. They're not in the army, but they teach mathematics in the Iran universities and so on, and they have synagogues, they have kosher butchers, they have schools. They even have a hospital in Tehran and in Isfahan, and they have communities in Shiraz, Isfahan, and even Hamadan, completely unmolested. So their endless proclamations of hatred for Jews is all a big lie. The people that Persians don't like, and in fact despise, are Arabs. Well, the fall of Aleppo could not have happened if the power of Iran had not been crushed, really weakened by the Israelis dismantling Hezbollah. Iran has invested more in Hezbollah than it has invested in its own army. Iran has an army, not just Revolutionary Guards running around the world. They've spent more on Hezbollah than on their own army. That investment is now for naught. I knew Angelo very well. Well, in order to have an intelligence organization, you need talented people who have a particular proclivity to go outside of their own country. They know how to make friends with people. They know how to recruit people. They have a way of handling that. So, for example, there are many Americans who are born in Utah, they get married in Utah, they study in Utah, and they work in Utah. If you parachute them into northern Macedonia, they are unlikely to be ready to make friends in northern Macedonia and get people together. Now, the way CIA is run is that, in order to avoid espionage penetrations, you cannot work for CIA without getting a security clearance. The people doing the security clearances \u2014 many of them are Mormons, as it happens \u2014 but the people doing the security clearances, they have absolute criteria. \u201cCIA cannot employ anybody that we cannot easily clear.\u201d Any Ame"

    "keywords": "At the Abundance Conference a few weeks ago, today\u2019s guests joined me on a panel to discuss \u201cHow Bureaucracy is Breaking Government.\u201d They were so insightful that I invited them back to re-record the conversation for Statecraft . Brief intros: Nicholas Bagley was General Counsel to Governor Gretchen Whitmer . He wrote an article called The Procedure Fetish about the problems with the procedures we\u2019ve created for federal agencies. Kathy Stack served almost three decades at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Since then, she has spent her time thinking about how better use of data can improve federal and state social programs. Jenny Mattingley also served at the OMB, focusing on hiring reform and workforce efforts. She was also the founding director of the White House Leadership Development Program . Why isn\u2019t the Paperwork Reduction Act doing its job? Why is there no constituency for government effectiveness? How difficult is it to create a new form? How have the right and the left collaborated to strengthen judicial review? This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: What do members of Congress, executives on Wall Street, and UN Ambassadors all have in common? They read Principals , a non-partisan, analytical, and free political newsletter by Semafor. Each morning, Semafor Principals delivers distilled glimpses into the corridors of power in Washington and beyond. Join thousands of leaders on the Hill who rely on Principals to kick off their day \u2014 subscribe for free . How would you describe the problem you\u2019re trying to solve? Bagley: Lawyers have a lot of well-intentioned concerns about the way that government agencies function. But we process those concerns by layering more and more procedural rules on agencies so they will do what we care about. We have lost track of ensuring government agencies can operate effectively. Stack: My focus is strengthening the capacity of state and local governments to use federal funds effectively. Over a trillion dollars in federal grants go out annually. Hundreds of overlapping federal programs and state and local governments are stymied by layers of administrative requirements, outdated rules, and misconceptions about what they're allowed to do. We need a way of cleaning that up. Mattingley: I look at how you make federal agencies work better, both for constituents and for federal employees, because there are a lot of out-of-date policies and laws. A lot of myth and procedure could be peeled back. How do we get people to take a step back and streamline them? Stack: The Paperwork Reduction Act was seen as a way of reducing burden by coordinating across programs, making sure that they collected the information that was required and nothing else. But it\u2019s become a transactional OMB review process, where each program is left on its own to figure out what data comes into OMB. Reviewing this is, frankly, a fairly low priority for OMB, because the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs [ OIRA, nestled within OMB ] that now oversees the PRA was also given responsibility in the \u201880s for regulatory review, which always takes priority. Mattingley: This is one of my favorite issues where laws from the \u201870s haven't changed to catch up with how business is done these days. The PRA says that you can't ask the same question of more than 10 people. [ NB: After we recorded this interview, OIRA published new guidance that encourages agencies to conduct usability testing. It states that agencies are no longer bound by this requirement. ] Otherwise, it triggers this whole review process, which can take months or years. In the \u201880s, the idea was that agencies were constantly asking people to fill out 20-page forms. Mailing out forms was a cost to the government and there was a cost to the person filling it out and mailing it back. So the goal was not to overburden people with 20 agencies asking the same question with the same forms. Fast forward to today where everything is web-based: you're not mailing forms, and people are used to filling out quick surveys. The law doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. If the Veterans Affairs Department is putting up a form for veterans to sign up for a service, they can either go through the process of posting what they want to do in the Federal Register and taking six or eight months for review with OIRA. Or they can go out to veterans and say \u201cCan you fill this form out? Does it work for you? Do you understand the questions?\u201d and then start tweaking. I think most citizens would assume that\u2019s how things happen. But this is why we see things take so long to change or don\u2019t account for user feedback. They\u2019re built without customer input. [ See how Marina Nitze tackled this issue at the Veterans Affairs Department in a previous Statecraft interview. ] Stack: The OMB creates government-wide policies that affect how state and local governments are allowed to use their funds. OMB has something called Uniform Grants Guidance, which sets documentation requirements for the finance and performance reporting that state and local governments must use. Every grant program has to report back to OMB, and there is a Paperwork Reduction Act requirement that requires all of those reporting instruments to come through OMB for clearance. These are implemented by different parts of OMB, but OMB lacks a good sense of how they interact at the local level. And there are tons of OMB requirements. Even when they're rescinded or replaced, the view on the outside is that these are still requirements. OMB does not have a feedback loop to understand how much time public servants are spending on things that are not required, but that people assume is either an OMB or a statutory requirement. OMB also does not have an off switch. New administrations come in with new policy officials. They want new programs and regulations to address a particular high-profile problem. A small staff at OMB is amazing at marshaling resources to solve that problem. The solution is usually a new layer of policy or process. There is rarely a request from the White House to look at what is getting in the way of accomplishing policies or being more effective about implementing longstanding laws. Bagley: If you work at OMB and you see these paperwork requests, part of your day job is helping agencies make those better. And so if you're asked, \u201cDoes the Paperwork Reduction Act do good?\u201d From your perspective, you've helped people make their requests better. It looks like the PRA is working. What you never see is all the time and effort that's wasted getting your approval, and all the costs it imposes on actually getting user feedback. So some of the staunchest adherents to some of the stupidest procedural rules are the very agencies that are implementing them. If you talk to folks at OIRA, they will tell you the Paperwork Reduction Act is a really important part of their job. \u201cIt's really important that we have a lever here.\u201d What's never asked is, \u201dWhat kind of harm are you trying to guard against? And is it worth the candle?\u201d Because gosh, the costs are acute and the benefits are what? Some improvements on the questions you ask on a few forms from the Social Security Administration? Really? Is that worth all the time and wasted effort from agencies? Can't we trust them to do their jobs well enough that we don't need to create this bottleneck on basic user feedback? We're talking about problems that ought to be relatively straightforward to solve. OMB and the agencies are all part of the executive branch, they can get on the phone and call each other. Imagine how magnified these problems are when challenges to agency actions get routed through the judiciary. You've got generalist judges who don't know the first thing about agency operations or the domain, but who weigh in with wide-ranging review authority and tell agencies how to do their jobs. It's the problem we see with the Paperwork Reduction Act, but on steroids. Let's say I'm at Veterans Affairs and I'm trying to roll out a new program that involves forms. What interactions do I have with OMB or other agencies? Bagley: The first stop is not to go to OMB, it's to get the form crafted within the agency. Agencies are big and complicated and often require lots of different units to weigh in. Only after you've worked through the internal bottlenecks do you get to turn to OMB. Mattingley: It could be the privacy officer, depending on what type of information you're going to collect. It's often the Office of General Counsel, so you have to get the agency lawyers to sign off. Often, folks trying to do customer experience or user feedback get blocked by their own agencies. They're not even making it up to the OIRA review because their agency has said \u201dWe're going to hit the Paperwork Reduction Act, we can't ask those questions.\u201d There are ways to get exceptions or blanket approval, but it never gets to that point because agencies think there's a regulatory blocker, so they don't even go there. Again, it's a myth that's built up. So part of it is OIRA. Part of it is this significant burden in the agencies. Stack: There are also missed opportunities with the PRA. Agencies are looking through their own lens at what information they need to collect in a program to meet statutory and regulatory requirements. But they can't see the high-value data that's being collected by a sister program or a different department. In theory, the on-paper goal of the Paperwork Reduction Act is for OMB to help people understand what data is already being collected that could be reused. Another missed opportunity is definitions and data standards. Each program is on its own to set up its own collection instruments. They're not looking across to see that 20 different programs are using the same term with a different meaning. Or where they could be using standard metrics that would incentivize state and local governments to set up more integrated data systems and analytics capacity. We've got a lot of people on hamster wheels collecting data for compliance purposes to meet reporting requirements that were set sometimes decades ago. They keep pushing data up to the federal government. It's not useful to the grantees or the federal agencies, and it\u2019s certainly not reducing administrative burden. Stack: I have an example, but OIRA and the Paperwork Reduction Act had nothing to do with it. President Obama was focused on getting unscrupulous higher education institutions out of the student loan program, because they were saddling kids with debt and not training them for good jobs. He needed to figure out, what were those bad schools? My part of OMB worked with the Education Department, the Treasury, and the IRS to take information collected by the IRS and use that to pre-populate the FAFSA form [ Free Application for Federal Student Aid ]. This made completing the FAFSA simpler, reducing one burden. It also allowed us to link student loan and student aid information from Education with IRS data, so that we could see the earnings outcomes of kids going through these programs. So it was a win-win: prepopulating the FAFSA form reduced the time burden on the people who fill it out. And by getting those agencies working together, we found a way to measure earnings outcomes that enabled the Department of Education to weed out the bad schools. OIRA did not play a real role in that, but it happened in part because the center of government, OMB, was able to see the connections and bring the right players together. Bagley: Kathy\u2019s example is an example of highly effective management, but just notice it had nothing to do with legalistic compliance with procedural rules. I think we're too apt to think that if you just make a law, agencies are going to perform better. But if you've got a badly-performing agency, you need to think about resource constraints, management, information flow: a whole list of genuine problems that have nothing to do with compliance with legalistic rules. Bagley: You can imagine asking, in your darkest moments, what are the bad things an agency might do? As soon as you conjure one of these terrible stories, you can usually point to a law Congress has adopted to force the agency to do better. You might be worried that agencies are going to hide things from the public. So we have the Freedom of Information Act. You might be afraid that members of an advisory committee are meeting outside the public meeting rooms. So there's the Federal Advisory Committees Act. You might be worried that agencies are going to make bad decisions. So you subject their decisions to hard-look review in the courts, which requires the courts to walk through their justifications and invalidate the agency action if it's found wanting. None of these are bad goals. We want agencies to be transparent and accountable, make good decisions, and think about the environment. But the rules are strikingly inattentive to the way they make agencies defensive, slow, sclerotic, hidebound, and legalistic \u2014 instead of serving the collective goals that we've set. It sounds like you\u2019re saying procedural burdens on agencies function that way too. Bagley: Absolutely. It's a one-way ratchet. In its recent changes to administrative law, the Supreme Court doubled down on this highly legalistic, procedural approach to governance. When businesses complain about government red tape, those concerns are taken seriously, although they don\u2019t always lead to action. But concerns that government is too bogged down by procedural rules aren\u2019t taken very seriously. We seem content to impose ever greater regulatory burdens on government officials at the expense of them doing their jobs effectively. Bagley: One reason is that these laws create constituencies that thrive on them. Environmental organizations use the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to object to projects that they dislike. Because they depend on NEPA, they will vigorously fight efforts to limit its reach, even if NEPA is making it harder to build the renewable facilities we need to bring online to combat climate change. It\u2019s an important part of how they exercise power. They are not going to let it go without a fight. Another big problem is there is rarely an organized constituency pushing to relieve burdens on government agencies. Who is affected by the Paperwork Reduction Act? It's the veteran who has a crappy web interface. It's the Medicaid beneficiary who can't figure out how to get benefits. It's the entities that are trying to communicate with these big, sprawling bureaucracies. The bureaucracies can't speak to them to get feedback to improve their operations. In that context, who's going to muscle a reform law through Congress? No one cares enough, even if it's a problem that affects us all quite acutely in the aggregate. Mattingley: There's also a myth that builds up within federal agencies about what the policy is. Agencies layer policies on top of the law or the OMB policy as a way to avoid getting in trouble for something. There's this risk aversion, so they set processes that are not actually required by the law. Systems are created because somebody along the way thought it was necessary to protect the agency. 20 years later, nobody questions why these policies were put in place, and no one has the mandate to go through and scale them back. Agencies are following policies written in the \u201870s and \u201880s. They still talk about faxing forms as a requirement because it\u2019s no one\u2019s job to say, \u201cHow do we go back through everything and make it simpler?\u201d But why aren't presidents more motivated to fix this problem for themselves? Why is there not a natural equilibrium, where this stuff gets periodically solved by new administrations? Bagley: Presidents have a lot of priorities. Mucking about in procedural rules that are going to have a generalized effect on their ability to carry out their mission isn't their primary focus. Sometimes strong leadership from the top really can make a difference. At the state level, some of the permitting reform efforts have made progress at this. It\u2019s not impossible. But presidents care more about achieving substantive success in a narrow set of issues than about making it possible for Fish and Wildlife Services to move a little quicker, or for the Forest Service to be able to come up with forest remediation plans quicker. Those just aren't going to rise to the White House. The constituencies that maintain the current set of procedural rules are left more or less undisturbed. Stack: In my experience at OMB, most presidents come in and staff the White House policy councils with a lot of congressional staffers. If they've come from the Hill, they're the people they know. It\u2019s just the inside-Washington view: you want to have people working for you who have those relationships and can move legislation. But these appointees have never worked in federal agencies at a level where they've understood the impact of these procedural constraints. Legislation is often developed with a complete blind spot on all of these administrative procedures. Mattingley: When we've talked to folks in Congress to get them interested in procedural issues, it\u2019s not what their constituents care about. So that's not what they're going to spend their limited time doing. A president has 4,000 political appointments. They stay for only about two years. It's not quick to do the type of policy review and de-layering that we're talking about. And heads of agencies are turning over in a much quicker timeframe. It just makes it really tough to build that natural constituency. I do think some organizations care a lot about it. We need the environmental or health care or land use groups to understand how they touch government and why government working better is important to what they want to do. That's a long-term, heavy lift. But we can start to change the conversation by building understanding intentionally. Just telling people user feedback doesn't get collected and it should be, for example. The one exception during my career, a president who really cared about implementation issues, was George W. Bush. He was an MBA. He'd been a governor. He brought a lot of people from the Texas government who had been closer to the ground and understood implementation issues. He brought the different parts of OMB together by essentially forcing OMB to develop what they call The President's Management Agenda . That required the budget side of OMB which worked on new programs to work with the management side and develop a set of implementation initiatives that held Cabinet agencies accountable for assessing their effectiveness and figuring out improvement plans. They took on some of these issues, like the security clearance process for new hires. But these fixes take a long time. It takes real patience from the top to say we're going to invest in things where the payoff may not happen for four or six years. Is a governor with executive experience better positioned to tackle these problems than somebody from the legislative branch? Bagley: Without question. Governors have a mandate to address the bread-and-butter issues of their constituents. And, importantly, a lot of governors are trying to get elected in purplish states. The governor\u2019s big issues were \u201cfixing the damn roads,\u201d bringing jobs to Michigan, preventing folk from leaving the state by creating high-quality career paths here. Once you start to say, \u201dHow do we get a new semiconductor facility to locate here in Michigan? What are the kind of levers we have to pull?\u201d The answer is by pushing through the bureaucracy. Then you see that it\u2019s the same thing for the roads. As soon as you see that, you say, \u201cWait a minute. I've got to start making choices and reorienting my administration to avoid the stumbling blocks.\u201d Stack: I've been looking at examples of state and local gov"

Van Gieson is a remarkable character, with a crazy CV: more than 25 years of experience in developing medical technology, and stints at multiple federal agencies including DARPA. You may know that an American nonprofit, EcoHealth Alliance, received funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for bat virus research, and that it was working on that research with collaborators in Wuhan, where COVID broke out. Before EcoHealth received NIH funding, it pitched a project to DARPA involving the insertion of human-specific cleavage sites into SARS-related bat coronaviruses. While Dr. Van Gieson was at DARPA, that proposal came across his desk. We talked about it today. Van Gieson is also largely responsible for developing the Containerized BioContainment System (CBCS), a novel system used to move Ebola patients. We get into that in this conversation, but we cover a lot else; it\u2019s a longer interview than most we\u2019ve published. We tried to trim it down, but there\u2019s so much good stuff here: word for word, it\u2019s one of the richest interviews we\u2019ve done. A lot of people have spilled a lot of ink discussing what went wrong during COVID, but I think what Van Gieson lays out here is close to a comprehensive account of the reasons we blew it, and how not to blow it in the future. Why is the federal \u201cpandemic preparedness\u201d apparatus so sprawling? Why haven\u2019t we learned from COVID mistakes, or even run reviews on what went wrong? How would you revamp the federal apparatus to be ready for the next pandemic? We don\u2019t test whether generic drugs can fight pathogens. Why not??

By Santi Ruiz 11.12.24 \u2014 U.S. Politics 152 234 In a few short weeks, Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 47th president. His transition team will be in charge of a federal government that, in many rudimentary ways, doesn\u2019t work. Let\u2019s leave aside partisan gridlock in Congress and turmoil in the judicial branch, and just focus on the executive branch: National Public Data, which aggregates personal information for background checks, was hacked this year , meaning your Social Security number is now floating around on the internet. The IRS is built on mainframes from 1965 and relies on code from JFK\u2019s administration that no one\u2019s learning anymore. The pandemic highlighted our broken systems: In January 2020, the Food and Drug Administration effectively banned private companies from rolling out their own Covid tests because the CDC was developing their own. But the CDC tests turned out to be defective , leaving the U.S. flying blind until private companies could rush in and pick up the slack. For the past year, I\u2019ve run an interview series called Statecraft where I talk with civil servants to understand how the federal sausage actually gets made. These men and women serve in a variety of roles, such as running a CIA base in Afghanistan , investigating Soviet anthrax leaks , and redesigning Department of Labor job centers . The best of them have managed to deliver good outcomes for the American people by working around the worst ingrained practices of the federal bureaucracy, and they have lessons for reformers eager to make the federal government go. But changing the culture of a machine this size takes time. Despite the fact he will have a Republican House and Senate, and the allyship of Elon Musk, who seems eager to head his own Department of Government Efficiency , Trump faces the same broken federal machinery\u2014and will face many of the same problems, and the shot clock to solve them\u2014that Biden did. To help make the government more efficient and effective instantly, the Trump team should prioritize the following: Progressives fear Trump\u2019s vision for civil service reform, Schedule F , which would reclassify many civil servants to make them easier to fire. They worry Schedule F would gut executive branch agencies\u2014which includes the Environmental Protection Agency, the Departments of Education, State, Justice, et al.\u2014of their talent, and consolidate power in the White House. But even liberals like Jen Pahlka, former deputy chief technology officer of America under President Obama, have pointed out that \u201cmanaging out\u201d a poor performer can be a full-time job for political appointees. Firing an executive branch civil servant requires extensive documentation. Additionally, many employees are unionized, and all can appeal their firings internally. Partially as a result, the government cans bad employees about four times less often than the private sector does. It takes a lot more than saying \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d to get people out the door. It\u2019s also impossible to hire new, better civil servants. Our systems for sourcing are shattered. Take Jack Cable, 17, who won the Department of Defense\u2019s \u201cHack the Air Force\u201d contest against 600 other contestants by identifying weaknesses in Pentagon software. But when Cable applied for a DoD role, his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was graded \u201c not minimally qualified \u201d because the hiring manager didn\u2019t know anything about the coding languages he listed himself proficient in. Or take the Federal Aviation Administration, which has been screening prospective air traffic controllers for how many sports they played in high school in an effort to meet its racial quotas. A strategic administration will encourage agencies to find creative ways to bring in top talent. It could try using new tools to assess technically talented applicants in bulk, or it could increase the number of academic rotations through the Intergovernmental Personnel Act , which allows academics to contribute part-time to special federal agency projects. The Office of Personnel Management can and should encourage more aggressive use of Direct Hire Authority , allowing agencies to avoid certain procedural steps of the federal hiring process.

It\u2019s a dark bit and not especially funny, but very serious people spend their time preparing for that last eventuality. Today, we spoke to Dr. Jeffrey Freeman, who directs the National Center for Disaster Medicine and Public Health (NCDMPH). Dr. Freeman leads a team that Congress has tasked with studying something called the National Disaster Medical System , which would coordinate how we treat casualties in the event of a hot war with a peer. He worries that if we don\u2019t prepare now, our on-paper system for distributing patients is likely to collapse once the shooting starts.

For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: The NCDMPH is an interagency organization that looks at strengthening our military and civilian health systems to respond to the medical requirements of a large-scale combat operation, with a peer or a near-peer. In that situation, there's going to be a large number of both military and potentially civilian casualties. If folks are returning home from an overseas war, we're going to have to ensure that they can receive care. As a consequence, we have a lot of bosses, including folks from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security, Transportation, Veterans Affairs (VA), and State. When we visit a site, particularly when we're going to an area of a geographic combatant command like INDOPACOM , we speak to folks who represent all of those groups. We go to Tripler , which is the military treatment facility on-island in Oahu, and talk with folks from the major VA medical center and also federal, state, and local partners: HHS, FEMA, and the local hospital systems such as Queens Medical Center , the only Level I trauma center in Hawaii. We let them know why we\u2019re here and try to better understand their situations, because our work requires their cooperation. If war broke out in certain areas in the Indo-Pacific, and we're having to move folks from theater back to the United States to receive definitive care, it\u2019s complex. INDOPACOM is the geographic combatant command in which the hostilities are occurring, so our partnership is essential. Other non-geographic combatant commands, like Transportation Command : that's going to have to carry a lot of the weight in moving people and stuff. There are the DOD military treatment facilities, both in Hawaii and back home, that will have to receive some of these folks, plus VA medical centers. There are also about 1,800 civilian hospitals that have signed an agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services to support this mission. Understanding all of those partners and how folks will flow from theater back to care is a monumental challenge. That number is an unclassified, notional scenario based on the number of casualties that were returning home and needing care during World War II. There are classified scenarios, some that have already been developed, and others that are in development now based on what we're learning from recent conflicts. Those classified scenarios are much more specific in terms of not just the number, but the nature of the injuries themselves, which is going to be quite different than what we observed, say, in Iraq and Afghanistan. That 1,000 per day over 100 days is a fair benchmark on the high side. And that unclassed notional scenario is both easy for folks to understand, and also large enough that it's going to stress the system in the ways that we would expect a true conflict with a peer or near-peer to generate. That\u2019s why we use it, especially when working in an unclassified setting, which this mission requires. If the nation goes to war with a peer, it's not a whole-of-government thing. It's a whole-of-nation and maybe even a whole-of-the-world, when we consider some of our partners and allies that would likely be involved. Let's say I'm on a naval destroyer around the South China Sea, and I have a serious but not life-threatening injury. Eventually I end up, hopefully, in Hawaii? And then potentially back home on the mainland. How do I get there? Even Hawaii is a debated step. With a casualty downrange, first you're going to have to get that person and evac them out of the theater. In the cases of Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. had absolute air superiority. We could get people out quickly and back to what we refer to as a role 4 care, which is definitive care in a major hospital or MTF, meaning a military treatment facility. In conflict with a peer, we're not sure we'll have air superiority. In addition, there's only so many military resources that can actually move people. A lot of those resources are going to be occupied with moving the things that are needed to carry out, execute, and hopefully win a conflict. But there are what we would refer to as flights of opportunity, where planes are needed to return to restock, get critical supplies, and be sent back to the fight. We anticipate that folks will probably be loaded onto some of those planes that are, of course, equipped for moving casualties. Those planes will fly them back from theater to what we refer to as a core casualty reception site \u2014 these are designated military installations where very large military planes can land, unload those casualties, restock, and return. Maybe you stop in Honolulu or not; maybe that's a fuel stop. Maybe you have to stop operationally or strategically. Those considerations are all really wartime considerations. We can plan as best we can. Certainly, there are plans around what routes to take and where and where these folks would go. Take everything with a grain of salt. There\u2019s a phrase \u2014 no plan survives first contact. But there are some things I can say that are pretty sure. They are going to land at one of those core casualty reception facilities. How do we then move them through this broader process? We have a system that we refer to as the National Disaster Medical System , or the NDMS. This construct was actually created back in the \u201880s during the Cold War. The concern was: if we go to war with the USSR and we have large numbers of casualties, how are we going to provide care for them? What that amounted to is a partnership between Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services. Within that construct, you've got military treatment facilities that fall under the DOD, VA medical centers under the VA, and then you have those civilian hospitals under HHS ASPR , the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response. When you have casualties, the idea is to flow those folks through these places. After landing at core casualty reception sites, a Federal Coordinating Center will try to identify where we can send them. Are there open staffed beds at MTF\u2019s VA facilities, or at civilian hospitals? From there, the decision is made as there is some availability. Then we have to transport them. That\u2019s another challenge because military vehicles will probably be forward-deployed. Then we have to look at civilian assets. There are things like the national ambulatory contract that FEMA owns. That's a contract with a number of different emergency medical services companies, a resource-sharing compact that FEMA manages. Let\u2019s say a hurricane hits Florida really hard. We could potentially pull in EMS ambulances and other sorts of capacity from a neighboring state. That model works pretty well because there's not a lot of EMS capacity in the country. If you're talking about a natural disaster, that is a bounded, acute, and geographically limited event. But in the case of war, we're talking about a protracted and geographically unbound event. So a contract that relies on sharing, when everybody's having to deal with the same resources, is probably going to reach its limits quickly. That's an open question. There are other commercial contracts that we could look at that could potentially help people move. Air is one way to think about moving people from point A to point B, beyond just an ambulance or helicopter. We might have to be more creative. In Europe, in World War II, they used trains, and they've converted trains into hospitals now in Ukraine. That might also become a requirement for this sort of mission. That being said, it's not easy to outfit a train, as they\u2019re currently outfitted, into a hospital that is capable of moving trauma patients, for example. We\u2019d have to look at many options to accomplish something at this scale. That was really striking to me. Are there lots of hospitals that don\u2019t realize they\u2019d have contractual obligations when war hits? That is not just a very valid concern for some of our colleagues. We've observed that directly executing this NDMS pilot program \u2014 the project that is explicitly looking to assess and strengthen our military and civilian health systems to meet the requirements of this mission. We have pilot sites across the country where we're looking at these key gaps, challenges, seams. In all of those sites, where we engaged with the civilian side of this mission set, very few people fully understood that their hospital had even signed the memorandum of agreement with HHS to support this mission. When they had, there was a pretty large lack of understanding of what their actual role would be and how they would execute that mission. The hospital administrators may be totally unaware that in a prior administration, years ago, someone may have signed the memorandum of agreement with HHS ASPR. This basic agreement says: In the event of war, natural disaster, or other health emergency, if we need to leverage beds and staff from your hospital, we would expect that you would provide them. As a benefit to that, when you move in NDMS patients, you are given a sort of guaranteed reimbursement. Under the memorandum of agreement, it was roughly 110 or 115% of CMS . That has changed now. They've actually increased that to 125% to incentivize hospital participation. Even if they did know, what does that look like? They naturally ask: \u201cHow are we going to adjudicate large numbers of casualties coming in?\u201d Because the NDMS, since its creation in the \u201880s, has really only been used for natural disasters and smaller events, but it has never been activated at scale. No. Vietnam was certainly a large-scale combat operation, Korea was large, but none of those were at this scale. And in neither of those instances did the U.S. homeland come under attack. There's a reasonable expectation that if we're at war with a peer, we probably can't assume a sovereign homeland. In the same way that we probably can't assume air superiority in theater, a war at that scale is going to look very different. The kind of thing we are preparing for now is something closer to the scale of World War II. There are a few things. Let\u2019s start with the National Disaster Medical System, the thing we\u2019ve spent most of our time on. It was created in the \u201880s to do this kind of mission, but it's not constructed in such a way to meet those requirements. There are roughly 3,400 intermittent federal employees, folks who can be activated and become a fed at that moment. You have a number of different DMAT \u2014 Disaster Medical Assistance Teams \u2014 that can be deployed. They rotate in. They're really adept at doing what they have done for 20 years, which is responding to natural disasters and other critical events. But in a war, a staff augmentation model is not going to meet the very large delta between where we are and what we need. It's both a quantity and a design constraint. Quantity because there are only so many staffed and available beds in this country. Most hospitals operate with a very fine margin. Most hospitals are anywhere from 85% capacity to, for many of them, over capacity. The hospital in Hawaii, for example: Their steady state is above capacity. The analogy I use is that our military and civilian health systems operate much like a restaurant after the dinner rush. If your listeners have not had the great privilege of working in a restaurant, as I have: restaurants are really only fully staffed during a few hours of any given night. That\u2019s just during the dinner rush when most people come in to eat. After things begin to slow down each night, they'll cut a bunch of their staff, servers, bussers, hosts. They can't afford to have a bunch of people standing around with nothing to do. But sometimes, after those cuts have been made, a school bus pulls up, and it's got a high school band or soccer team on it. It just breaks the kitchen, because you're running a skeleton crew in that restaurant. Our health systems are exactly the same way. They can't have a bunch of doctors, nurses, other clinicians, technicians \u2014 or even medical supplies, as we observed during COVID \u2014 sitting around in the event that the proverbial pandemic bus pulls up, or in this instance, war. They've got to maintain a really razor-thin financial margin. In addition, one trend that limits our ability to respond is that our health system spent the last 20 years optimizing itself: trying to become more efficient, more optimal in the way in which it\u2019s set up. The problem with this is it means we have much leaner systems and much more vulnerable systems. If you introduce a major perturbation into the requirements upon which a system has been optimized, you will break that system. If we have a war, if we have a next pandemic, a more severe pandemic, or any other catastrophic event on the homeland, there's just very little margin available to us anywhere in this country to meet those demands. So getting all the way back to the NDMS \u2014 they can do staff augmentation, they can send DMAT teams, but that only gets you so far. Fundamentally, they try to reduce their inputs. They want to get more use out of the clinicians that they do have. They want fewer clinicians providing the same services wherever possible. They also want to hone their healthcare delivery model such that it finally meets the expected patient demand, at any given moment. Now, that looks different over the course of a year. There's flu season. There are other sorts of things that matter. When you introduce changes to that expected demand, you can cripple the healthcare system. During COVID you might remember the term tripledemic. RSV, flu, and COVID all hit kids at once when they started to return to school. The reason that was so problematic is what happened during the shutdowns. Kids weren't at school or in daycare, so they weren't spreading all the illnesses that they normally do. They were also not in hospitals needing care for more severe ailments. Since kids are pretty healthy for the most part, they\u2019re typically pretty ill when they do show up in hospital. During COVID, those patients were not in hospitals anymore, and instead they were replaced with relatively lower-cost COVID patients. Hospitals lost a lot of money during that time. So they made cuts, which led to burnout as they ran lower staff footprints. Then kids went back to school and daycare and started to get sick at higher rates again. Some of those kids started to show up in hospitals, but we had essentially crippled our pediatric intensive care system across the country. Nobody intended for that impact to occur, but it gives you a sense of how optimized our health systems are for only the expected demand. Anything out of the ordinary is really problematic. Some of the ways are very good. Optimizing the delivery of care to patients recognizes that patients are different. They might use electronic health record systems combined with advanced analytic approaches to acknowledge differences in a patient who is 70 versus one who is 40, a patient who is 70 and obese versus a patient who is 70 and not obese, and other sorts of comorbidities that patients and individuals may have. If you can individualize care in a targeted way, then those folks don't necessarily have to remain in the hospital as long, and when they are discharged they\u2019re less likely to come back. If you just think about sheer throughput from a hospital financial perspective, you really do want to maintain consistent throughput if you can. There's a three-dimensional approach that you have to take to prepare for or respond to any major, large-scale, potentially catastrophic event. The first is where the government traditionally has spent most of its time, asking, \u201cWhat can we do to strengthen the response capacity or even approach to respond to the events, as it exists today?\u201d That may be increasing the number of intermittent employees. It may be our Disaster Medical Assistance Teams changing their models. Instead of staff augmentation, maybe they can serve as a staff multiplier. That dimension is within our control. The second approach, policy changes, is for our colleagues on Capitol Hill. How can we improve the systems of tomorrow? We need to inform Congress on the fundamental changes that they need to make to prepare our nation. Some are simple policy changes or authorities. What additional resources need to be given to FEMA's national ambulatory contract? What additional authorities might need to be given to the president or cabinet secretary or a particular agency or organization to meet these requirements? There will be many. But Congress doesn't have a silver bullet. And that gets to the crux of the issue: no matter what we do in those first two dimensions, we're never going to bridge the delta all the way to the massive requirements that would be required in a wartime scenario. We're going to have to build an immense amount of capacity at the moment, on the fly. And importantly, we're going to have to do that in an environment where the mission will trump everything. The rules as we know them, as well as our assumptions, the things that we've learned throughout our careers, just may not apply. We saw a little bit of that in COVID. But in a wartime scenario, you'll see a lot more of that. The third thing that the government has to do along with its partners, at every level, is think about how we build capacity more quickly, more effectively, on the fly, than we ever have before. We refer to it as \u201cbuilding on the fly by design,\u201d where the mission trumps all and the rules do not apply. It basically requires you to walk the dog, so to speak. Step one in building on the fly by design is to imagine the requirements that would be derived from the worst-case scenarios: a large-scale combat operation overseas, combined with a cyberattack on the homeland, combined with the emergence potentially of an infectious agent, whether intentional, accidental, or natural. What are these worst-case scenarios that we're going to see, and what are the requirements of that? Is it moving X number of patients? Is it providing what composition of care to individuals? But that's only piece one, and government has done that, traditionally speaking. It does a lot of worst-case scenario types of planning, but it's the second and third things that become really important. Step two: given the requirements of the worst possible things we can imagine now, let's imagine what solutions, capability, or capacity could be developed, refashioned, or re-vectored at that moment to meet those requirements. We're not talking about things "

    "keywords": "This week\u2019s interview is a little different: it\u2019s a live recording of a panel I hosted three weeks ago at the Bottlenecks Conference in San Francisco. Broadly speaking, Sam Hammond is interested in state capacity from the right, and Jen Pahlka is interested in state capacity from the left. I was particularly interested in getting answers to a question about the political economy of state capacity. Specifically, is there actually room for a political coalition for state capacity? Maybe we agree in theory that the federal government should work better. But in practice, what if we mean entirely different things? Hammond and Pahlka graciously indulged that question and others, including: Should Trump implement Schedule F? Why is it so hard to get rid of fax machines in government? What cues should today\u2019s reformers take from the Progressive Era? What is Canada doing right? Brief bios: Hammond is a Senior Economist at the Foundation for American Innovation , where he focuses on AI policy. Pahlka is a Senior Fellow at the Niskanen Center and the Federation of American Scientists , and the author of Recoding America . We\u2019ve interviewed her before. Thanks to Rita Sokolova for judicious transcript edits. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Samuel Hammond : If you look at people like Matt Yglesias or Ezra Klein , you can interpret their role as translating things that are already taken for granted by the right for progressive Democrats. They did that for housing and a few other issues, and now they're doing it for state capacity. So I think there's a freebased version of state capacity. They\u2019re helping folks who are part of a coalition that is the main inhibitor to state capacity to assimilate those ideas. Jen Pahlka : If the question is where Sam and I disagree, I think that there's likely far more agreement than disagreement. I'll start with the fact that if you come from the left, you're constantly told that the right doesn't care about state capacity at all, which is not true. I think the left is, probably correctly, concerned with state capacity in ways that you are not, per your post on the Effective Altruism (EA) case for Trump. But we're both talking about a world in which we stop having massive denial about tradeoffs and say, \u201cNo, these things aren't good, but these better things are more valuable, so we're going to take the loss to get a win.\u201d SH : We both see where the problems are, but my view is that they're a lot worse and less fixable through incremental reform. Any major structural reform will have to be bipartisan, and that's going to require having factions in both parties build a new consensus that the system is fundamentally broken. And you need some kind of exogenous ability to critique that incumbent system, because if you come from within, you're just going to get co-opted. A good example of this was the Endless Frontier Act, which became the \u201cScience\u201d part of the CHIPS and Science Act [ See the Statecraft interviews on the passage and implementation of CHIPS ]. The Endless Frontier Act was initially put forward by Sen. Todd Young (R-IN) as an idea to build a separate but parallel tech directive for doing applied research and for programming $100 billion at the NSF. As that proposal worked its way through the horse-trading in Congress, you saw every former NSF president or university president come out of the woodwork and write articles in The Hill saying that this would destroy the NSF\u2019s mission. At the end of the process, you got something that was very watered down. It marginally increased support for science, but it didn't get to the fundamental issue. We have a grants-based model of science; if we were doing the Manhattan Project today, there would be like a thousand requests for proposals (RFPs). We need to transcend that system, and that\u2019ll require people waking up to this on both sides of the aisle. Instead of the axis being left or right, it has to be \u201cbroken or not broken.\u201d JP : I very much agree \u2014 we have to just stop that. It\u2019s like the Judgment of Solomon : if you say, \u201cYou shouldn't have the baby, I shouldn't have the baby, we'll kill the baby,\u201d then nobody has the baby. And that's kind of what we're doing now. If you don\u2019t want the other side to have the capacity to do things because you don't agree with their agenda, and you don't have it either, then nobody has it. I think that Sam is looking more at how things are getting watered down at the legislative level. I'm looking at what I call the cascade of rigidity that happens after that watering down, where even the gains get eroded because the bureaucracy is risk-averse. JP : The story that I've probably told the most is about a friend of mine who worked on a project at the Air Force. Back in 2014, we were trying to get new software on the satellites that manage GPS, and the project was extremely delayed and way over budget. They had inserted a huge enterprise service bus (ESB) in the middle of a really simple protocol; it was so complex and Rube Goldberg -y that it caused timeouts between the ground stations and the satellite. He asked why this ESB was in there, and someone said that it's a requirement in the contract. As he pulled the thread, he found out that everybody believed this was required by Congress. So he went back and looked at the Clinger Cohen Act , which requires all agencies to have a plan for how they're going to handle technology. At some point, somebody wrote some guidance around that, which suggested interoperability using ESBs \u2014 for software developers who are asking, \u201cWhy is she talking about ESBs?\u201d, this was in the \u201890s. As it descended from the federal enterprise architecture to the Department of Defense enterprise architecture to the US Air Force enterprise architecture to an actual contract, it went from being a suggestion to a requirement. So you have something that comes from Congress or the White House that's pretty on target and very generic and flexible, but as it falls through that cascade, it becomes incrementally more rigid, more specific, and less able to withstand the test of time. This actually jammed up the software to the point where they couldn\u2019t get it out and had to ship the satellites with the old software. Even when we get things right at the legislative level, we screw it up at the implementation level. SH : Yes and no. There are often small tweaks that can have ripple effects across an organization. But my view is that there are two deeper sets of issues. One is the broader issue of lack of trust from Nixon onward. You may make a persuasive argument that we need to empower the executive branch to make more unilateral decisions, but if you're a Democrat and you're worried about Trump getting in, you also want to constrain the executive, and vice versa. It leads to an accumulation of constraints on authority. The second thing is a deeper political economy issue. We\u2019re living on burning down the capital of the New Deal era. Our Social Security numbers are from 1936 \u2014 and they're all hacked now , by the way. The IRS is built on mainframes from 1965, which still use the same Assembly code from John F. Kennedy's administration. JP : We're working on that. SH : There\u2019s a funny story about how the guy who was migrating the IRS master file from Assembly to Java had his contract expire. Now he's working at the Social Security Administration. The Long Twentieth Century , which I think of as the middle period of the Great Society era, saw the decline of parties and unions, and more power shifted into large foundations, which pioneered the grant-based model. People in San Francisco know how much money gets filtered through nonprofit organizations. I think of that as a privatization by another name, and it\u2019s one of the sources of today\u2019s diffuse authority. Thinking in terms of long periods of history, that is due to change. We\u2019ve had multiple change-focused elections where nothing actually happened. Changes are ultimately driven by shifts in the technological base. The worlds of 1900 and 1950 were totally different, and that\u2019s how we got the New Deal \u2014 1900 was before the Wright Brothers, and by 1950 we had every three letter agency and were going to the moon. In the early Progressive era, some of the first industrialists were building the first large corporations, and they had a new science of management about how to actually have direct reports and supervisors and so forth. That was eventually brought into government and led to the administrative state. If you think of AI as a technology that fundamentally implicates how we structure an organization, we're going to go through another transition in the same way that Uber and Lyft displaced regulated taxi commissions. We\u2019ll either reform the government to embrace those new models, or things will get so bad that basic government functions will get displaced into the private sector in the same way that we now rely on SpaceX for what NASA did in the past. JP : I think it's a reasonable model to look at, in part because it was bipartisan. SH : Yeah, a lot of people on the new right take inspiration from early progressive voices like Roosevelt. Those waves of progressivism were partly a critique of patronage, clientelism, and corruption; now it\u2019s a critique of nonprofits winning a contract and just putting that money toward executive pay and not actually doing anything \u2014 you know, going to Argentina to study their bus stops , that kind of thing. The corruption we have today is more opaque. It used to be Tammany Hall -style stuff, and now it's filtered through opaque organizations and dark money groups. These are structures that we've inherited, and they were designed in part to be resistant to reform \u2014 probably to have that cascade-of-rigidity effect by design. The liberal legal network of the \u201850s and \u201860s eventually turned into a kind of special interest liberalism, where the idea was to use public choice problems to our advantage. We built programs on top of a constituency because that constituency will lobby for that program and make it hard to repeal. A good example of this is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which provides vouchers to purchase baby formula. Half of the mothers in America get baby formula through the WIC program. During the pandemic, there was a massive baby formula shortage. Why? Because the WIC program was set up so that every state grants an exclusive manufacturing contract to produce the formula. If you win that contract, you have 100% of the market. That was by design: if you're worried about Reagan repealing the WIC program, make sure every single state has a constituency that will lobby against it. That model works fine if you're at the end of history where nothing is changing, because you can lock things in. But if you lock things in and expect history to continue and technology to change, that delays necessary reforms to the point of crisis. JP : Another way to think about the comparison to the Progressive era is returning to the \u201chow,\u201d not just the \u201cwhat.\u201d Ironically, some of what we have to undo now was built then. Civil service reform is desperately needed, and they were talking about it then too, but we're actually going to undo what they did. In that era, people really needed new models of professionalization, and then we just let that rot. We too seldom bring our attention back to the \u201chow,\u201d and it needs a huge refresh. So we're both inspired by the Progressive era and will also need to dismantle a bunch of Progressive era wins. SH : I'm Canadian, and my favorite Prime Minister was Jean Chr\u00e9tien . In 1999, he unilaterally passed a budget that fired a third of the civil service. To me, this is not as insane or radical; in Canada we have a democracy where, if you have the majority, you just run the government. This is common across most parliamentary systems: they shut down ministries and start new ones. America seems uniquely sclerotic in this sense, partly because of the Congressional structure and checks and balances. But we have had periods where we did build new things \u2014 Vannevar Bush started what became the Manhattan Project with a two-page memo to FDR, which was approved in 14 days. We could do that again, but it's going to require purging a lot of the plaque that's built up in the system. This isn't about going back to a spoils system where we're appointing the My Pillow guy to whatever. Hopefully it brings some fresh blood into the system. The new industrialists and JP Morgans are like Patrick Collison ; the Secretary of Defense should be like the Palmer Luckeys of the world. These are people who understand the scale and extent of the crisis that we're facing. In the case of Elon Musk , for example, they have a very different sense of how to manage an organization. Musk calls it a subtraction approach \u2014 if you're not subtracting things from your product until it breaks, you're not subtracting enough. You can always add things back in. JP : Sam and I agree that you can't really run a government when you can't fire people. People will tell you, \u201cOf course you can fire people,\u201d but on a practical basis, it takes so much time that it's a choice between doing anything else and \u201cmanaging out\u201d an employee. Schedule F doesn't fix that, which is a big problem. We need to reform the civil service, not slap some veneer of reform on top of it that doesn't work and can really only be used in certain situations. Schedule F doesn't actually put any system in place for real accountability. I think the left needs to really look in the mirror \u2014 I\u2019m stealing Don Kettl 's line, but you can't fight something with nothing. The left has not put forth a credible vision of what civil service reform would look like that gets to the outcomes we all want. So Schedule F looks appealing, but it just doesn't do anything that we need civil service reform to do, and it really gets at the independence of civil servants to be able to stand up and say, \u201cYou know, this is what the science says.\u201d SH : You could make the case that California YIMBY has been the most successful advocacy campaign of the last decade, and that's coming predominantly from moderate Democratic voices. So there is a faction that understands these issues really well, but they're a minority. CA YIMBY can have very outsized power, partly because even though they're outnumbered by the NIMBYs, the NIMBYs are suffering under their own problems of diffuse authority and they're not actually coordinated. JP : In general, I feel like the right has got great thinking. There's so much in terms of permitting reform that you can give Republicans a high five for. If you want to improve state capacity, you have to do three things: you need to have the right people, focus them on the right things, and burden them less. We may disagree a little bit in terms of Schedule F and how to get the right people, but the right obviously has a huge legacy of getting government to focus instead of trying to do everything. So I don't think Sam's totally wrong when he says Ezra Klein is just making ideas from the right more palatable for progressives. Burdening public servants less is an area where the left and the right need to come together, but neither of them really gets it. There's been a thesis on the right that burdening public servants decreases the burden on the public, and it's just wrong. It's absolutely disproven, we're just not looking at the evidence. Are there other, similar areas where you're hopeful that a similar bipartisan consensus can develop? SH : Broader industrial policy issues. Everything-bagel liberalism , right? When a party enacts a program and begins to own it, that gives them some motivation to make sure that it works. Within the Biden administration, there has been a faction of folks who understand these issues really deeply and are working on piecemeal things to make sure that money actually gets out the door and goes to productive projects. You know, there's always a little bit of a graft in these things that you sort of have to take. Canada also has a housing issue, but Toronto now has more fixed construction cranes than every US city combined. Why? Because the province established the Ontario Land Tribunal . It's an administrative body that has the ability to override judicial review and local decisions on land use. You have NIMBYs in Toronto saying, \u201cDon't build here,\u201d and they're just like, \u201cNo, we're going to build here.\u201d That would strike most Americans as deeply unconstitutional. There's this idea of state capacity libertarianism \u2014 I call myself a Robert Moses libertarian. I don't know if that\u2019s an oxymoron. There's a gray area in the law that gets exploited in moments of crisis. My biggest complaint about COVID was just how little we did to actually fix deeper issues. We are in this complacent mode \u2014 we've fallen into what you could call a fiscalist regime, and all we can do is pass massive reconciliation bills that spend more money on broken existing programs. I\u2019m blackpilled by the fact that lines around the block to claim unemployment insurance and websites having business hours where you can\u2019t use them after 5PM were not enough motivation to actually drive reform. I think we could probably fix those systems. Private sector organizations build parallel systems that just replace the broken thing, and the public sector probably needs to do that. When things get so broken, you're often better off starting greenfield. JP : I actually don't disagree with that. We just also have to understand that if you don't manage that really well, it's a very bloody process. In some sense, it's actually not about issues, but about whether you think the government should do X or Y. If the government can do neither of those things, it's deeply unsettling. Sam mentioned trust and faith in government, and I do think we have to just go for it: if we say X, we're going to get X done. We should fight those fights on the political level, and not through friction. On the other hand, it is all about the issues and the outcomes. I thought Noah Smith was really good on this when talking about whether neoliberalism was good or bad . He said that the abundance agenda is to stop thinking so much about the ways neoliberalism has constrained our thinking to process ways, that it\u2019s really about just saying, \u201cWe want these things, let's go get them and shape the process to get the outcome,\u201d not the other way around. I would imagine that we probably agree on all the things that are on that abundance list. We're trying to create a government that just gets those things for people. JP : I do. He brought up the state unemployment insurance delivery \u2014 almost none of that has been fixed. New Jersey's done a great job, and a couple of other states have gotten a little bit better, but it\u2019s essentially just doing the same thing we did pre-COVID. We didn't fundamentally change the model by which we develop that software or deliver that service. We didn't do any policy or process simplification. We just said, \u201cOh, let's throw more money at Deloitte and hope that they can fix the thing that they broke in the first place. Every time we give them more money, it gets worse, but let's just keep doing that.\u201d That's a perfect case in which we've made very, very little progress because we haven't changed the model. But you\u2019re saying that the exogenous shock of COVID didn't have these disruptive benefits. So should we be doomers about everything? JP : I don't think we had a field ready to deal with that and to channel that energy toward something sustainable. We need to now build that field so that with each successive shock that we have to go through, we use that energy to pull towards a new model that we can articulate. It's like what Don Kettl said, you can't fight something with nothing. As reformers, we had nothing. So we should be working on that"

    "keywords": "The inaugural reader survey Statecraft on Statecraft Statecraft turns one year old today! In that year, we\u2019ve gone from a suggestion from a friend (thanks Parth) to more than 10,000 subscribers. We\u2019ve interviewed senior Cabinet members, presidential confidantes, DARPA PMs, historians, CIA agents, and a host of plucky civil servants. Take the reader survey! Statecraft is a project of the Institute for Progress , or IFP, where I work. IFP\u2019s support has meant that Statecraft is a free newsletter and will remain one for a long time to come. In this past year, we\u2019ve done exactly 0 paid media; the newsletter\u2019s growth has been entirely organic. We feel proud of that. Your consistent support and feedback are the secret sauce. If you like Statecraft , please tell your friends, family, and colleagues! For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Here\u2019s Statecraft\u2019s growth curve over the past year: Lessons learned What\u2019s worked so far? Here are some lessons I\u2019ve learned over the year, in no particular order: Building a very large backlog of interviews before launching gave me breathing room to hunt down new interviewees and prep for them. On the flip side, it pushed some interviews slightly past their sell-by date. I could have been more aggressive or creative in restructuring the calendar to keep interviews topical. On the flip side, being uncompromising about the schedule created useful pressure to just ship interviews. It helped to kick off the project with an extremely aggressive comms push. We asked everybody and their mother to promote Statecraft . Ramping up the pace of interviews from 2x a month to 3x a month to 1x per week (our current pace) has juiced newsletter growth. Readers really like interviews about DARPA and the CIA. Anything that gets to Marginal Revolution or Hacker News does very well. Readers didn\u2019t much care for our Valentine\u2019s Day and Christmas specials. Sorry, readers \u2013 I still think they were funny. Beyond the above, it\u2019s very hard to know what readers will love ahead of time. Some of the conversations I was most excited about were not smash hits, and some interviews that I expected to fall flat have been very well received. This is probably healthy, on net, in that it keeps me from slipping into audience capture. The best practices for producing good material depend on the medium. That is, there are all kinds of tips and tricks I followed when we were just publishing Statecraft in print format that no longer apply now that we\u2019re also podcasting. Interview prep pays off for middle-of-the-bell-curve interviewees. You can take a conversation from fine to fascinating if you\u2019ve done the prep beforehand. Prep can\u2019t salvage a conversation with someone who can\u2019t or won\u2019t tell you the interesting stuff, and the most interesting and charming storytellers are good interviewees even if you\u2019re underprepared. Take the reader survey! First things first, we\u2019re hiring an assistant editor: click here to apply . Transparently, I think this is a tremendous opportunity for the right person, who will both work on Statecraft and support the excellent IFP team. I love working at IFP and think you will too. Even if this is not the right job for you, please pass it along to friends who might be good fits. We\u2019ll pay $3,000 to the person who successfully refers our eventual hire (you don\u2019t have to message us, just have them put your name in the \u201cWho referred you?\u201d section of the application). What else is upcoming? I think we\u2019ve had a lot of success with this project, but I want to find more ways of opening up the throttle. One piece of that is improving the product. I\u2019m a decent interviewer, but the best interviewers are much better than me. I can improve on multiple axes, from the boring stuff, like enunciation, to the fun stuff, like contesting interviewee claims in real-time. We\u2019ll also continue to hunt for excellent, surprising interviewees (and already have some excellent folks lined up). There are some \u201cpapercuts\u201d I\u2019d like to deal with too, marginal improvements: things like including the PDF/printable version of each interview, or tidying the live transcripts on podcast apps. We also have a lot of open questions. Should we be leaning into video? Pushing harder to land active political figures as interviewees? Or should we stick to the classics; tight transcripts and maybe a little podcast here and there? Should we share more behind-the-scenes material? Are there types of questions you think we consistently overlook, or types of questions you wish we\u2019d scrap? We want to hear your thoughts. Take the inaugural survey and help me continue to improve this newsletter! It\u2019ll take 45 seconds max. For the anniversary episode, we're switching it up: my friend Daniel Golliher interviews me about Statecraft . Daniel runs a remarkable project called Maximum New York ; it\u2019s a new civic school focused on governmental mechanics. I highly encourage you to check it out if you\u2019re in NYC, or interested in city governance more broadly. Thank you to Rita Sokolova for judicious transcript edits. Santi: A couple of reasons. The proximate cause was a very good suggestion from a friend who said, \u201cHere's an idea: You guys would be well set up to do this, IFP already has an audience and relationships, and there's this great tacit knowledge out there. Can't we make some of it legible? Wouldn't that information be high-impact if you could extract it from people's heads and codify it and ask follow-up questions?\u201d We were blessed to have some of the pieces already in place. There's a lot of implicit knowledge that you can only get from shadowing someone in their day job or working on a craft, but a lot of policymaker knowledge is not like that. You can make it legible. A lot of that is practices of not just governance, but also how Congress and executive branch agencies work. All of that can be demystified for educated lay readers. We\u2019re interested in not just pressure tactics to make the government do things, but how to make something happen if you\u2019re within the bureaucracy \u2014 who do you write to, what do you say, what is legally permissible? The internal sausage making. Also, there was a market niche. There's a lot of horse race coverage: people are already covering what Mitch McConnell is thinking, what the president is saying. But there's not a ton of coverage of this procedural knowledge outside of trade publications. Plenty of folks in a given industry will get really into the weeds \u2014 if you're in geothermal, you likely already know how the Department of Energy works \u2014 but a lot of that stuff is paywalled and hidden. It's a huge arbitrage opportunity, even within the government, because the government's massive and there's all kinds of stuff buried in the weeds. We did an interview on Other Transaction Authority, or OTA, which is a procurement model that some agencies use a lot. Other agencies have the power to and don\u2019t, and instead use much more arcane, difficult, and dumb processes. Plenty of those folks who could use it don't even know they have this authority. OTA is a perfect case: it's not just that the public doesn't know about the topic, but even the practitioners who would immediately benefit don't know about this thing. The last part is that I think these are genuinely interesting stories that don\u2019t get enough coverage. Many of the interviewees are not elected officials, so they're not as interested or as motivated to tell their stories. You hear about the heroism of people who are running for your vote, but you don't hear about somebody who doesn't need to be reelected in November. There's a lot of good stuff hiding under stones. How do you select the people you interview? Because as you mentioned, this is tacit knowledge, and many of these people are buried in the weeds. To start out, we tried to mine our network as much as possible. I'm at the Institute for Progress , which is a think tank that focuses on tech and science innovation policy. Our team has a great network of folks, so I mined that network quite a bit to get recommendations. And I used to be in right-wing news media, so I have some connections over there. We also have some connections from the Obama-era Office of Science and Technology Policy, and those folks have a big Rolodex. Making the funnel as wide as possible in the beginning was really valuable. Not everybody that we think of, or even reach out to, will necessarily be a great interview. The point is just to generate a bunch of names. As you do your research, you figure out whether this person's got a great story, and whether they can or want to tell it, and can tell it well. You have to filter a lot. Another key strategy is snowballing interviews. Anybody you talk to for anything, ask them, \"Can you give me three names? Who else do you think would be interested? Who would you be interested in reading?\" Use every touch point as an opportunity to generate more. There's a lot of brainstorming about which stories are interesting, and whether there is a person who we can interview about it. PEPFAR, which is the anti-HIV/AIDS program that was really successful in Africa and parts of the Caribbean, was launched during the Bush administration in 2003 \u2014 That was our first. I was interested in it but I didn't know anything about it at the time, but there are widely available oral histories out there. There's a whole set of Statecraft interviews where we started from, \u201cOkay, this is interesting. Who actually executed or implemented this and would be interesting to talk to?\u201d There were a couple where I replicated work between interviews and realized that the interviews are very similar because they're parts of the same story. Folks who are either elected officials or mid-career and positioning to go back into government are not great interviews. They're wisely protecting their political capital, so they\u2019re very constrained in what they say publicly. The model you choose, whether on record or on background, is important. For Statecraft we\u2019ve largely let interviewees see the edited transcript before we publish, but the interviews themselves are on record. Some interviewees will ask for full editorial control before anything goes public. Some of those folks give you a great juicy interview upfront, and then they hack away at the good stuff in post. It's a trade-off \u2014 maybe you wouldn't have gotten them at all if you had said, \"We're going fully on the record, I'm going to use anything you say.\" Some interviews end up truncated or worse than you'd like them to be. They still contain a lot of good things, but the delta between what we got on audio and what I was allowed to publish is, unfortunately, sometimes large. That's right. Forget I ever said that. I've got a bunch of language for cold email outreach and for responses to warm intros that I use liberally. I think it's good copy, and I would recommend coming up with good language that you can reuse. If I know what I want to talk about with somebody, I'll just say, \"Can I book an hour on your calendar?\" and make it as easy as possible. If there's somebody who potentially has a lot of stories and you're not sure where you want to focus, or you don't know their area especially well, it\u2019s helpful to get 15 minutes on their calendar to scope the interview, which will often guide the research. I'll say, \u201cCan we get 15 minutes on your calendar next week and we'll find a time to call afterward?\u201d If people need clearance from their existing agency, that's a long process because press officers and comms folks are not working on your timeline. You\u2019re not their primary customer. That can build months of delay into your process, and you often have to send over proposed questions in advance. Once we get a date on the calendar, there\u2019s a lot of reading, a lot of copying and pasting stuff into a Google Doc. I don't want to replicate stuff that's already in the public sphere, so figuring out what they've already done is really useful. I highlight potential questions and group them by categories and I tend to over-prepare so that there's lots of good stuff. Ideally, you don't get to all of it because they take one path and you go down that route. I use Descript to record and transcribe, but I think many tools will give you equivalent outputs. The big time sink is editing. Over an hour, I'll get about 12,000 words in a raw transcript once you cut out the \u201cUms\u201d and \u201cUhs.\u201d My rough cutoff for interviews is about 6,000 words \u2014 you could certainly do a wide range, but that\u2019s just a personal preference for how long I want an interview and a newsletter to be. So I spend a lot of time going through the raw transcript hacking away at stuff. Lately, I've had a couple of editorial assistants who will tackle that, and that's been a huge help because they've got great editorial judgment. It's good to have another pair of eyes and different opinions about what's interesting. But that can be a day's work depending on the interview length. I'm finicky about how I want the transcripts to be. If I was less finicky, it would not take nearly as long. I think you could do raw transcripts, and just have it be a podcast first with transcripts as a byproduct. Then you wouldn't have to do a lot of this work. There are cases where it makes sense to do another interview, either because the person's a great interviewee and I want to get as much out of them as possible, or because I'll realize that the front half was the good stuff and we replicated material at the end. Totally. There are some cases where my prep is inadequate and they have a different view of something, or the publicly available information is not necessarily true to their experience. Sometimes people will say, \u201cThat thing that's attributed to me was really a team effort,\u201d and they'll beg off a given accomplishment and you have to reroute. Sometimes the claim is, \u201cYes, I was instrumental in accomplishing this thing, but it was really through a different pathway than Wikipedia and the oral histories and other people will tell you.\u201d Other times, people have a very strong corrective sentence to the popular perception of how an agency works and you don't realize that until you start talking to them and they are at pains to explain, \"No, it doesn't work the way you think.\" Sometimes you can use that to your advantage. There's an interview with Russ Vought, who was the director of President Trump\u2019s Office of Management and the Budget (OMB), which is the president's taskmaster in the federal government. There's been a long-standing debate between Trump and Democratic administrations about how OMB should be used, its role and authorities, and the value of career civil servants. Sometimes you can get really useful or interesting information by just pressing on that sore spot and saying, \u201cYou know, critics say \u2018X.\u2019 Would you agree with that assessment?\u201d It's a topic that they've already thought about and there's intense feeling that you can access with the right question. The background state of affairs is that there are fewer and fewer people who are doing in-depth research and public-facing presentations of that research. There are more journalists scrolling Twitter and making a story out of the things they see on there. Everybody talks about the decline of the local news media, even in New York, so I think there\u2019s a huge opportunity there. One way to do it is to develop yourself as a part-time beat reporter and, instead of just focusing on the interviews as the product, you develop expertise on an individual topic through talking to a lot of folks, showing up at the events, reading through the transcript of the minutes for the council meeting, etc. You can very quickly become the expert on fill-in-the-blank, and that gives you access to stories that you would not have gotten if you were doing the Statecraft version and just talking to a bunch of different people about different things. Yeah, that's right. If you wanted to do even the federal version of Statecraft that's really specific to the Department of Energy, there's tons of value there. It's a question of interest and focus and time. IFP, my home think tank, is interested in good governance generally. We want to find stuff that replicates across other domains of the federal bureaucracy and other bureaucracies. That\u2019s preexisting interest, not everybody is trying to get more agencies to use Other Transaction Authority. There's a lot of good material you can draw out with different motivations. Yes, and, you know, I could succumb to audience capture and do only pieces about the ARPAs, because readers love those and read them twice as much as they read other interviews. You could similarly lean into audience capture locally. What's the sexiest topic in city government? Is it housing? Yeah, controversial. A more classic Statecraft model would be pretty easy to replicate. The challenge would be identifying people who can talk. There are lots of incentives for existing federal officials to talk, and they're in the public eye more often, even if they're not electeds, and so they've developed media sense and an interest in being talked about. Even if you're not running for office, maybe part of what makes you enjoy your role as a senior executive official in some government agency is being talked about. That may not be true in the waste management bureau or the equivalent role in city government, but you don't generate headlines the way that important people at USAID generated headlines. Statecraft has had a lot of success by keeping an eye on folks who are leaving the federal government and trying to grab them as they come out, sort of like an exit interview. How closely can you follow that at the city level? Yeah. Although the revolving door seems common in the federal context \u2014 folks will leave four different times over the course of their careers as administrations change or they go take some Harvard fellowship for a couple years. If you're looking to do a bunch of municipal interviews, I think you'll have a different set of challenges getting people to talk than you would doing these at the federal level. I would imagine that a higher percentage of the people you want to talk to are in government currently. That said, maybe there's a similar nonprofit revolving door complex, or you go into consulting or set up your own shop. I don't actually know how you make money after you exit your vehicle. The truth is that many of the current ones don't have experience in the private sector. Their whole life is this revolving door, or they began on someone's campaign and they never left. They entered the government and that's all they know. A city councilwoman just lost her seat in the most recent election, and she immediately got a job with a prominent nonprofit here in the city. Because that\u2019s what you\u2019re qualified for? I think there are certain spheres of municipal governance that lots of folks have taken good cracks at demystifying, like transportation costs or infrastructure costs. I think that transportation is really amenable to demystification, because you can do comparative work and say, \u201cHere's what Tokyo and London and South Africa spend on rail.\u201d Ditto housing, you can do comparative work there. I would be interested in Statecraft -style projects that try to demystify things that are not infrastructure or housing. This is just another idea, but there's a ton of data on policing, and that is not as common to see comparative work on. Waste management is another one \u2014 there are many different modes of waste management, but I haven't read the definitive piece on why London does it this way and Los Angeles does it another way. It\u2019s been in the news in New York recently, but it hasn\u2019t seeped into the public consciousness the way that YIMBY ideas about zoning have. There's a ton of material that is ready to hand. You could also look at contracts. It\u2019s very easy to find interesting and maddening stu"

Today, we talked to two men who oversaw the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant , or WIPP, the only American repository for transuranic waste. WIPP stores material from sites around the country in an underground salt block. WIPP was hit with two major, back-to-back accidents in 2014: a truck traversing the facility caught on fire, and chemical reactions in a container from Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) caused a release of radiological material. The two accidents shut down the facility completely. Today\u2019s guests, Mark Bollinger and Todd Shrader, were managers of the Department of Energy\u2019s Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO) and oversaw the cleanup effort. Joining me in the interview was Hart Rapaport, a Department of Energy contractor and nuclear waste expert. Hart reached out to me months ago suggesting this would be a surprisingly interesting interview. He was right. Hart and I spoke with Bolllinger and Shrader to understand: How does the nuclear waste system work? How do you maintain a safety culture for decades? How do you make sure contractors deliver? Do safety regulations ever contradict each other? How do you know a disaster will happen before it happens? How does the nuclear waste system work? How do you maintain a safety culture for decades?

    "keywords": "Congress is notoriously slow to embrace new technology, and existing systems are out of date. We\u2019ve previously covered the shuttering of the Office of Technology Assessment , and how it may have made Congress weaker. Today\u2019s interviewee is Matt Lira , who has held a wide range of insider roles: Deputy Executive Director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Senior Advisor to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Special Assistant to the President for Innovation Policy and Initiatives in the White House Office of American Innovation from 2017 to 2021. In the White House, he coordinated policy initiatives to modernize legislative operations, including organizing the first Congressional Hackathon, the first use of the Facebook API by Congress, and the development of the first Congressional mobile app. Why is Congress so slow to adopt technologies that would significantly ease operations? How did a Congressman unilaterally introduce live-streaming of Congressional hearings? Would a Google Docs-style comment system for legislation ever work? What would Davy Crockett\u2019s social media presence be like? Thanks to Rita Sokolova for her judicious edits. For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: I think about this question on two tracks. The first track is the digital competency of Congress\u2019 operations: how they conduct the legislative process, engage with constituents, etc. The second track is digital competency as it relates to the policymaking itself. Progress is being made on both, but there are still ample opportunities and, frankly, a need for improvement in both lanes. On the operational side \u2014 and this is a statement I make with great respect for the progress that's been made and the people who have worked on it, and I'm not sparing myself in that criticism or challenge \u2014 there's a delta between how people live their daily lives and how they engage in the legislative process or with their representatives. That delta poses a problem, because it becomes harder for people to substantively engage in the legislative process, and it's also more difficult for legislators to share the progress they\u2019re actually making. When I testified to the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress in 2022, I said that Congress is like a student who does their homework but fails to turn it in at least some of the time. There are areas in which tremendous progress gets made on policy. These aren't always the big macro issues facing our society, but often niche issues that are incredibly important to a specific constituency. But even within that constituency, people are unaware that it's happening. In my view, that's largely driven by a disconnect between the digitally native way we live most of our lives \u2014 how we manage our finances, how we run our household, how we decide where to live, how we call a ride-sharing app to get around town \u2014 and how we would interface with Congress. Yeah, great question. The incentives are clearly there, but the institutional capacity isn\u2019t. There are two reasons for that. The first is just that it's a large organization; any large institution, whether it's a university or a company or a government agency, is going to struggle to keep pace with rapid technological change. Congress is no exception. The second reason is that Congress, particularly the House, has 435 independent constitutional offices. Those offices operate within a larger system that provides some capacities, but they also each have the constitutional authority to operate their individual office in the manner that they choose, within certain ethical and legal guidelines. Moving an institution like that forward is particularly challenging. But that challenge also creates an opportunity. If you take the bell curve of how members use technology to keep constituents informed and engaged, you get notable examples who are in the top 5% and as current in their use of technology as a leading business or an influencer. On the very other end of that bell curve, you have members and staff who've been there a long time and think, \u201cLook, I don't need that to get reelected and I don't want to learn this new system.\u201d They're not just struggling to get to the next level, they're overtly hostile to change. And sometimes not without reason \u2014 if they don't need to do it, they shouldn't do it for its own sake. The batting average in the middle is what concerns me. Are they moving in the right direction and are they moving fast enough? Over the course of my career, we\u2019ve seen that progress does get made and the batting average improves, but the technology is moving so rapidly that you\u2019re still always one step behind. You move two steps forward but the technology moves four steps forward, so you're still an institution that's behind. People on the inside will say that we need to do better. If you\u2019ve spent five years working on something and you're like, \u201cLook at all these things we've done, we did this and this and this,\u201d it can almost come across as defensive, but nevertheless the delta remains the same. Props to them for not letting the delta grow, but the challenge is actually to close the delta. I've long felt that there's a natural cycle to the House, because members retire and get defeated in elections. The new members, and those who stay because they're innovative in how they connect with their constituents, lead to a natural improvement over time. But there's still a long way to go. Let's take it from the perspective of a rank-and-file office, which is the personal office of an individual member of the House. That office primarily deals with their representative and the district they represent. These are not huge organizations because the budgets are relatively flat, and with inflation they might even be getting smaller. You have a certain number of working hours in a week across the whole team. A disproportionately large number of those working hours are being spent on filtering incoming messages \u2014 this is perhaps one of the least exciting issues I could have chosen, but in some ways, it's the most important one. For the sake of simplicity, let's say an office has 10 working hours for the week across the entire staff, and four of those working hours are legislative correspondents (LCs) filtering inbound messages and categorizing them for different kinds of responses. That\u2019s 40% of your capacity getting spent on a repetitive task. Without even getting into how some of the emerging AI technologies could solve this, there are mature automation tools that you could use to reduce that time spent to less than half an hour per week. That would liberate the rest of that time for higher order tasks, whether that's proactively communicating with constituents or doing legislative research and oversight. And that's just one office. If you take that and apply it across all 435 offices, you've unlocked a ton of institutional capacity. To me, it's the most powerful example of where technology is not being leveraged to increase the efficiency of these admittedly unglamorous problems. Look, if you're on the Hill and you follow the typical career path from intern to staff assistant to LC to legislative assistant (LA) to legislative director (LD) or chief of staff, you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, good, I don't have to deal with that problem anymore. I paid my dues because I spent my year filtering the messages.\u201d This is not true of everyone, but it becomes a lower priority problem to solve, and in some ways it's almost glorified. We do. With that bell curve, we do see that 5% on the bleeding edge experimenting. But, candidly, a lot of that experimentation has focused on external communication. It's almost like they need to hire one of those business transformation experts to just go in and work on these internal problems. There's only so much time on the clock, so a lot of the innovations have been focused on things that would be more visible to the public, and for reasons that I completely understand. That said, there's a second-order effect to solving problems like message filtering that unlocks a lot of opportunity. It\u2019s also a matter of resource constraint \u2014 it's not within the resource capacity of most individual offices to solve that problem alone, because they already have tight budgets. If you spend a dollar on process automation, that dollar is not going to bonuses, not going to salaries, not going to travel, not going to events. And even if you spend your whole budget on it, one office alone probably couldn't solve the problem. From my perspective, it\u2019s a tragedy of the commons. It would be highly appropriate for the institution to step in and say, we're going to help solve this by enabling enterprise contracts across the board. That gets into the more administrative pace problem that we touched on earlier. It takes a long time, and by the time they figure it out, the technologies have left them in the dust. It's challenging because we\u2019ve known about this problem for at least 10 years and different offices and individuals have made attempts at it, including myself. But then the member loses or the staff goes on to something else, and it gets lost. It is a danger, but it's not a new one. In some ways it proves the point about technology moving four steps at a time and improvements moving two. In 2011, President Obama said something like, \u201cCall your congressman,\u201d in a speech and then the phone lines were melted for like two days because so many people answered the call. Then during the SOPA/PIPA debate , Google and Reddit and others put something like \u201cCall your legislator\u201d on their homepages, and the phone lines crashed and email systems were strained. So leveraging technology platforms to enable widespread activism isn't new. As you said, the technology gets better and presents more risk, like with LLMs that could potentially even impersonate authentic grassroots activity, but my view is that it's Congress\u2019 responsibility to get better at engaging with the people rather than the people having to figure out how to engage with Congress. Rather than saying, \u201cJoe citizen, Jane citizen, you have to learn our system to talk to us,\u201d they're going to have to adopt new technologies and systems to prevent and check against abuses. Fortunately, I think that's the approach that they're taking. Whenever things change, like with email in the late \u201890s and early \u201800s, it\u2019s a natural reflex to say, \u201cWe\u2019re getting flooded, we can't handle it.\u201d And as we just touched on, Congress has yet to truly grapple with how to handle it completely. But they came up with ad hoc solutions, some of which remain in place today. Like throwing people at the problem. I could be wrong, but if we went into an office in 1980, I don't believe we'd see an LC struggling to filter all of these invalid messages for half the day. They'd get a stack of mail and they'd filter it by hand. They probably had different problems, like spending way more time typing up messages because each message had to be personally typed rather than the form letters for a given issue we have now, where they could just put the name in. So there are tradeoffs, but it's a major issue. The other thing that I think about in this bucket of operations is Clay Shirky's Cognitive Surplus , which is now perhaps slightly out of date, but nevertheless resonates here. In our society, there's now more cognitive energy and capacity to engage with Congress than Congress as an institution has the ability to process through its systems. Correspondence is the foundational element of that, but it also relates to witness testimony and how committee hearings operate, oversight and crowdfunding, how we draft legislative text, and ultimately creating a shared sense of ownership over the legislative progress. Technology and society have changed since the book was written, but Shirky, unintentionally, presents a compelling model that Congress could benefit from. At the end of the day, the institution is just cognitive in nature \u2014 it's not producing widgets. It's producing intellectual products, like law and oversight and discourse. If there's an education bill, how could the millions of educators, parents, and students get engaged in that process in a way that's not window dressing or AstroTurf, but actually authentic and improves the quality of the output? We saw during lockdown that communities were open to virtual engagement, and that enabled witnesses who were outside of the city and couldn\u2019t afford to travel to participate. It enables a different non-professional advocate, maybe just a school teacher in Kansas City, to testify. And that's just scratching the surface. I think we\u2019re still in the stone age of what could be. I applaud all of the experiments around it, but if I lament anything in that bucket, it's that Congress leverages technology in a very reactive way, probably because they're drinking from a fire hose. How can we leverage technology proactively to create a more engaging process? There are exceptions, like the Ways and Means field hearings , but the operational routine of Congress has yet to fully embrace many of these technologies. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, there's a legitimate debate around whether transparency reduces the overall quality and ability for deliberation. Just this morning I read that the Colorado legislature is considering eliminating personal emails from their sunshine laws , so that you can text and email colleagues and say, \u201cHey, what do you think about this?\u201d and not have that be subject to FOIA at the state level. It's the first time in a while that I've heard of a legislative body reducing transparency. I can see the point, but I tend to take the opposite position \u2014 I think leadership requires leaders who are capable of being honest with the public and able to bring them into a process. There are clearly ample opportunities for private conversations, even within the context of a committee hearing. They just go to the green room instead of doing it on the dais. Backstage, essentially. I don't even think it's called a green room, that's just what I call it, but it\u2019s the little room in the back where they sit before they go out to the dais. There are also private meetings on the house floor, or they pull aside. There\u2019s plenty of opportunity for that. Issa\u2019s approach was interesting because I do think it's a model for how change can and should be effectuated on a tactical level. They didn\u2019t ask for permission, they asked for forgiveness. Chairman Issa and his staff, particularly Seamus Kraft, were really pushing to do it and they just started live-streaming the hearings \u2014 the chairman had the authority, so they did it. Concurrently, folks like Reynold Schweickhardt , and others at the Committee of House Administration , and Karen Haas , who was the Clerk of the House at the time, were building institutional capacity to do it for all committees. So an early adopter set a precedent, learned the lessons, made some mistakes and fixed them, and then concurrently, you had institutional capacity that wasn't dependent on individuals like Chairman Issa or Seamus Kraft, so that the momentum wouldn\u2019t get lost when they moved on to new roles. Now, of course, every committee hearing is live-streamed. I think of this as installing a doorstop \u2014 it's one thing to open the door to transparency, but real reformers install a doorstop, so that if someone ever tries to close it, they can't. In general, I\u2019m actually far more disappointed by the impact of social media. I don't think that cameras in the committee rooms are the chief driver of some of the performative things we're seeing. What's driving that is the desire to create snippets and social media soundbites. I don't think that live-streaming is causing that issue, I think it's the nature of chasing likes. To some degree, of course. But I also think that his background plays a part \u2014 he is an engineer by training. When you went into his office, he had over 30 patents hanging on the wall. He had a really good staff that is focused on using data and technology in new ways. It was a primary order of their service, and he believed in it, backed them up, championed it, and led it. Oversight is an interesting committee, because it\u2019s responsible for both oversight and for government reform (GR). It\u2019s not always the case, but Issa was an example of how the oversight function is, almost by definition, deeply adversarial with the administration and with the other party. There\u2019s courtroom-level hostility between the parties, amplified by politics. But the GR side, which is also part of the committee\u2019s mandate, can be incredibly collaborative. When it's operating at its best, the same members and staff will have a productive but incredibly divisive and polarizing hearing on Tuesday, and then on Thursday, they'll have a hearing on modernizing agency operations at the VA , which you can watch, and it feels like a graduate level seminar on how to fix the VA. It's the same members. And you're like, \u201cOn Tuesday, I thought you guys were about to fight it out in the street.\u201d When it's well-led, the committee can navigate that. I share that only to point out that my impression of Issa was that he was committed to providing oversight and not only for political reasons. That has also been true of Democrats who've held the position. There is a constitutional role for robust oversight of the executive function , but I think a lot of the things that we were talking about were actually motivated by government reform and good government. He wanted to model that through his own committee, and in many ways he did. There's the live-streaming thing, which was successfully adopted over the long term. There was also Madison, which was a platform to accept comments and questions on legislative texts from the public at large. Issa would post proposed legislation, and you could highlight and leave comments, suggest edits, and then other users could leave comments on those comments, almost like a Google Doc. They ran that as an experiment and committed their legislative staff to reviewing the comments and suggestions and then adjudicating which to include. At the end of the process, they actually included several amendments to the bill text that had been sourced from that deliberation. It was successful in my view but it didn't take off and it didn't become institutionalized. My honest view is that it was a shot clock issue. His time as Chair ran out, and with leadership changes in the House and at the Oversight Committee, it got lost in the churn. It seems like implementation reforms can\u2019t really change that reality? That is ultimately the trickiest thing with cognitive surplus, and, to keep it optimistic, where I see the biggest opportunity. We can move beyond responsiveness, beyond operational efficiency, and into how we can leverage these platforms and technologies natively to enhance an agency\u2019s mission, in this case, legislation and oversight. One of the reasons there's a degree of cynicism amongst some staff as you describe is that there's a self-selection bias for people who will put up with it. If someone says to you that you're going to spend the next two, maybe three years filtering messages, some people are going to say, \u201cI'm out.\u201d I personally know a lot of really talented people who left Congress, members and staff both, because they wanted to do something more dynamic. I want to emphasize that there are still great people there, and I don\u2019t say that performatively, because it\u2019s true. But I remember once talking with someone about providing new authorities for a position inside an agency. The person who held the position at the time was, candidly, bad at their job \u2014 this was not on the Hill, but in the executive branch. And we got pushback: \u201cWhy would you want person X to have these new authorities?\u201d And I said, \u201cLook, you've got to design systems for both when good people have jobs and wh"

    "keywords": "At Statecraft , we\u2019ve talked to several economists about working within the federal government. Those conversations have largely been about how their work is structured. But I also wanted answers to some other concrete questions I had: about stimulus packages, inflation, labor force participation, and demographics. So I spoke to Ernie Tedeschi , former Chief Economist at the Council of Economic Advisers (These days he\u2019s Director of Economics at The Budget Lab ). \u201cFighting the last war\u201d in stimulus packages What\u2019s driving inflation The tools CEA economists have, and the tools they wish they had Are high interest rates driving low consumer sentiment? The demographic trend toward lower employment rates Why men are dropping out of the labor force Subscribe For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: [NB: This interview was recorded in late April.] \u201cMy sense is economics has weakened quite a bit as a public player in the past couple of years. Not just, by the way, in the Biden administration, but in the Trump administration too.\u201d He goes on to suggest that economics doesn't speak as a discipline with as clear or unanimous a voice as it once did and that political circumstances have changed. Is that true? In some respects, yes, in some respects, no. I think in certain areas economist voices have gotten through more, are louder, and are having an effect. For example, when you look at the response of both fiscal policy and monetary policy to the pandemic: that response would not have been nearly as swift or decisive if the economics discipline had no voice. Coming out of the Great Recession, there had been a lot of circumspection about the response in 2008/2009 and the subsequent very long recovery. That was a sluggish recovery for the first five years of that cycle, and really didn't start accelerating until 2014 or so. There were lessons coming out of that. You saw, mostly for better, sometimes for worse, the pandemic response was really fighting the last war. In some ways, it was the sort of Great Recession response that a lot of economists wish we had done. The way in which Klein might be right is, I do think that there was this infatuation with economists maybe for the first decade of the 21st century. It reminds me a lot of defense experts in the Vietnam War. There was this sort of technocratic fascination with them, that they could solve a lot of these problems. I think economists obviously have a lot to say about policy. But we are not the only people, we are not the only lens, we are not the only way of thinking in the room. That's something that working at the White House really brought home for me. I worked at the Council of Economic Advisors. I was surrounded by economists. But when I was collaborating within the administration, it was lawyers and engineers and climate scientists and different people who often spoke a very different technical language and different but extremely valid ways of looking at a problem. And yes, there was a political perspective too. Politics has become a bit of a pejorative term, the way it's commonly used nowadays. But at its best, politics is a responsiveness to the way that people want to order society. And in a democracy, politics in its purest form is the expression of the will of the people. So yes, the perspective of people on the ground should absolutely hold sway over economic debate. One last thing I'll say on that, just to make it real: in macroeconomics, one way that we measure trend inflation, which is where we think inflation might go over the next 6 to 12 months, is core inflation. And core inflation is inflation, taking out food and energy. The reason we take out food and energy is that historically food and energy prices have been volatile. If gas prices spike, they're probably going to come back down relatively quickly, so that spike doesn't really signal much about where other prices are going. [ For more on the nature of oil markets, see our recent interview with Skanda Amarnath and Arnab Datta, below] How to Calm Oil Markets Santi Ruiz \u00b7 July 18, 2024 Read full story It's a very standard metric in macroeconomics. But if we get too caught up in that, we forget that food and energy are extremely important to real people. We can't get too hung up on idiosyncratic things that make sense to economists, but that don't speak to the needs of real people. And are we getting better at responding in a more calibrated way to financial crises since the Great Recession and COVID? Let me tackle the second one first. I think the answer is yes. The economic toolkit that we have for fighting financial crises is undeniably broader than it was 14 years ago. Maybe not intellectually broader: there were creative thinkers 20, 30 years ago thinking about ways to do this. But we've actually tried many of these things now and we've gotten comfortable doing them. And look: that is thanks in large part to economists. Ben Bernanke in 2008, thinking, \u201cOkay, in this financial crisis, cutting the overnight rate to zero is not enough. What unconventional policy can we introduce that will ease conditions more?\u201d Quantitative easing (QE), for example, or forward guidance . It took the Federal Reserve a little while in that crisis to get comfortable with them, but they eventually introduced them. Fast forward to the pandemic and the Fed cut to zero, started QE and had issued forward guidance in March of 2020, before we had a single bad piece of unemployment data. That's how rapid the response was, because the Overton window had been widened already. I think that there has been a conclusion among economists that the response to the Great Recession was too tepid and that we should not make that mistake again. The size of the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan was, in large part, driven by that perspective from economists. I think it was also driven by the fact that this was an exogenous shock. Unlike the financial crisis, where you could at least make a moral hazard argument, nobody thought that COVID was anyone's fault. Especially with the CARES Act, that led to bipartisan support that is unusual for this sort of fiscal response. A great deal of the sorts of things that were done, the unemployment insurance, the PPP loans for businesses, were ideas that were in many ways informed by economists. So we have two different inflation measures. I don't know what the exact ratio is, but they share a great deal of data. They generally follow one another very well. The Consumer Price Index is much more well-known: It comes out earlier in the month, it gets a lot of press. But in some ways, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, PCE, is more important, because that's what the Fed follows for its two percent target . Yesterday we got CPI for March. When you look broadly over the last two years, CPI inflation has come down. It peaked at just north of 9% in the middle of 2022. Now it's at about 3.25% core, which I mentioned earlier, the metric that economists like to look at for an idea of what trends are going on. But that core measure ticked up faster than expected just for March individually. Now, normally you would not want to pay much attention to any one month and any sort of outlier in a month. The Bureau of Labor Statistics that collects these data, they are economic heroes. They do the best job they possibly can. They think about this all day. But at the end of the day, they're issuing a survey and collecting prices, and there can be noise in that survey. So you never want to focus too much on one month. However, February and January were a little bit hotter than expected as well. So once you have three months in a row where you're having these upside surprises, then you need to rethink your priors and your assessment of the economy. Before January, it looked broadly CPI and PCE inflation were coming down. We were getting closer and closer to the Fed's 2 percent target. We expected that, basically by the end of the year, we were going to get there, and that it was safe for the Fed to begin cutting rates this year. Now, at least in CPI, it seems like we're stalling out on core, and that's raising some worries that the last mile of disinflation might be harder than we thought. I am worried about that. I'm a little bit less worried than some folks, though, because the primary reason inflation is still high is very different than when inflation was hot in 2022. In 2022, all prices were hot and all prices were accelerating. Now, it's really just one or two big major components. It's almost entirely housing and then a little bit of auto insurance, especially in CPI. And those are both real but esoteric categories. In particular, with the way we measure housing, there's a lag between what we see on the ground with market data and then incorporating that market data into these official surveys, both CPI and PCE. We know from market data, put out by places like Zillow, that rents are growing, but they're now growing at a normal, pre-pandemic pace. It takes about a year for that normalization to work its way into the data. And we haven't had a year of that yet. There's good reason to think that's in the pipeline. That said, the Fed is not in the hopium business. They are in the \u201cWe need to actually see this in the data\u201d business. I get that, they are nervous. To be clear, I'm still a little bit nervous about it too. The dynamics of housing could very well be different than they were pre-pandemic. We may have more housing churn in equilibrium than we did before, for example. Maybe with working from home, the demand for space is just greater now in equilibrium than before. Maybe monetary policy is less effective than we used to think it was. How does CEA think about recommendations in a month-to-month sense? So our job at CEA is to make sure that robust economic data analysis and research are part of the policy conversation. The goal is not to make sure that economics is the paramount criterion in any decision that's being made. We just want to make sure that it's part of the considerations that are made; that when policymakers get together in the administration, they at least understand the economics. Then they integrate other considerations and, if they go against the economics, that happens. We just have to make sure that they understand the economics. When it comes to monthly data, our basic job is to make sure that the president knows any new data that comes out month-to-month. And so we literally have to tell him, look, we added this many jobs, inflation came in here, expectations were here. There\u2019s a sort of mechanical month-to-month update of the data in there. When we think that there is a broader story going on, we try very hard to pivot away from the trees and toward the forest, and show three-month moving averages or year-on-year growth rates or whatever we feel is a better metric of the broader contours of the economy. I found that one of the most fun and challenging parts of the job. You are both a spreadsheet person and a storyteller at the same time. You have to be good at both of those skills. Very similar, actually. So for example, in both places, we use a tool called Haver Analytics , which is if you've ever used the St. Louis Fed\u2019s FRED website [ Federal Reserve Economic Data ], it's a hyped-up version of that with much more data. The big difference with CEA is that if you work on data memos for the president, you get the data the night before, on a confidential basis. So that's one difference. But no, it's a lot of the same tools. CEA traditionally is a place where academics go. Generally, senior economists at CEA are tenured academics who will take a year or two of leave and do a rotation at the White House to advise. Academics are brilliant, and what's great about CEA is it's one of the few places in the government that can bring that skill set into the policymaking process. One of the challenges is that academia has a very different cadence than the speed of government. I know that people like to stereotype government as being this lumbering mastodon that moves very slowly. But I guarantee you, the White House is a mile a minute all the time. That can be challenging coming from academia to that sort of environment, where you don't have a year to ruminate on a question and to do umpteen iterations of a paper to get the graphs right. You have two days to give it your best shot. That's very much like the private sector, One of the reasons I think I was hired at CEA is because of my private sector background, and I think that made the transition for me a little bit easier. The two things that were the most challenging for me at the CEA were consumption data and savings data. We do have some consumption data. There's the Consumer Expenditure Survey that the Census Bureau releases. It's a survey, people fill out diaries of what they buy. It doesn't come out with nearly as high a frequency as the consumption questions that we have and that we get. I found that I really wanted scanner data on what people were buying at grocery stores, to get at questions about what prices people were actually seeing. How are they responding to those prices? Are they buying smaller things? Are they going from name brand to store brand? Are they buying less? What is going on here? Just, in general, beyond inflation, you get a check from the child tax credit. What are you spending that on? That would be extremely helpful, whether it were a government version or us working with a private provider. The other thing I mentioned was savings data. The best savings data that we get comes from a high-quality survey that the Federal Reserve does, called the Survey of Consumer Finances , but it only comes out once every three years. Particularly in this cycle, there were questions all the time about, \u201cHow much more savings do people have? Are they spending down their savings?\u201d There were several months where we had very strong aggregate consumer spending data, but we didn't have great real-time data to answer that question. Some private vendors, like the JPMorganChase Institute , ended up running some numbers using JPMorganChase accounts to show checking account balances over time on a higher frequency basis, and that was very helpful to us. But then, that raised questions, like, \u201cWhat about the unbanked? Is this a self-selected sample?\u201d Things like that, I found myself begging for. [ For our interview with former CEA Senior Adviser Martha Gimbel, see below] How to Wrangle the President's Economists Santi Ruiz \u00b7 April 17, 2024 Read full story We spoke to Ronnie Chatterji, who was at the National Economic Council. And he talked about wanting a very different pile of data about supply chain dynamics, a totally different world of economic data. Talk to me about the difference between the NEC and CEA. [ For our interview with Ronnie Chatterji, see below] How to Allocate $52 Billion in CHIPS Funding Santi Ruiz \u00b7 January 24, 2024 Read full story Yeah, sure. That\u2019s the number one question I get. There's no reason people should need to know that on the outside. But think of CEA as the think tank of the White House. And then think of NEC as the traffic cops who manage the policy process. There are legitimate experts and extremely smart people at NEC. NEC is led by an economist right now, Lael Brainard . But NEC is generally not full of economists per se. It's mostly staffed by lawyers who focus on economic policy. Their job is really to manage the interagency. What I mean by that is a question comes up: let's say it's forgiving student loans or something. Lots of different people within the federal government, different agencies, different stakeholders have expertise, have thoughts, have a stake in that question. NEC\u2019s job is to convene all of these people. So in the case of student loans, that could involve CEA because we have education economists. It could mean the Department of Education, it could mean the Treasury Department, because we're talking about debt that's being managed by the federal government. And NEC itself will have thoughts. The president's chief of staff will have thoughts. The Domestic Policy Council might have thoughts. Others will want to weigh in as well. NEC's job involves very much an element of art, of people management, so that we can reach consensus and something final can be brought to the president's attention for approval. Some CEAs have been more political than others. I think both Cecilia Rouse and the current chair, Jared Bernstein , have been very good about emphasizing the rigor of economics, because that's really what CEAs value add is: to be absolutely clear and transparent. That said, our advice is independent, but we are part of the administration. We work for the president. Our whole job is to make sure that the president understands and sees economic data, research considerations. CEA is not like, say, the Congressional Budget Office, or an independent regulatory body. But the advice CEA gives is meant to be reflective of the state of economic research. In that sense, it is independent. Some CEAs have been more political than others. Alan Blinder had a really interesting book on the history of fiscal and monetary policy in the United States in the post-WWII world. What is striking is actually how less in control of the policy process CEA has become over time. Remember, the NEC was a Clinton administration creation. So many pieces of economic policy before NEC \u2014 the one that comes to mind is the Kennedy tax cut \u2014 for example, were the brainchildren of CEA. That role of CEA has faded over time. We still give advice and do analysis, but fewer of the actual grand policy ideas come out of CEA. More and more come out of NEC. So in that sense of political, CEA has become less political. I don't know. If people read The Economic Report of the President cover to cover, I don't know how I would feel about those people. I am above the median American in nerdiness and wackiness, I think it's fair to say. Before I joined CEA, I would get The Economic Report of the President. During both the Obama and the Trump years, I'd flip through, and if there were interesting charts or interesting sections, I would dig into those charts and read those sections. But I would not read it like a novel. There have been some interesting reports that CEA produced that I thought were well done. So I remember under the Jason Furman CEA, they produced a report on long-term interest rates . It was a 30-page report, but it was extremely clear for a topic that is often muddled and vaporous and hard to get your head around. That report also got praise from people from across the political aisle. John Cochrane , who was not an Obama supporter by any stretch of the imagination, praised that report and said they really nailed the economics. Do things like Jobs Day discourse shape how you think about creating products from the inside? So yes and no. Take our Jobs Day tweets or our inflation tweets, for example. In crafting the template for those tweets, we did think about what metrics seem to resonate with people. That was definitely a factor that we took into account when we were composing them. But we also took pride in the fact that we generally would follow the same template for that tweet thread, regardless of whether the data were good or bad. We saw that as an opportunity to communicate the seriousness of CEA and to teach the public a little bit about the data. We had a couple of bad jobs reports and a healthy mix of good and bad inflation reports, and our Twitter thread was the same format, same charts, telling it like it was. I took pride in that, that CEA did it that way. Yeah, it's a really good question. Broadening this a little bit: It has definitely not been the case that the Federal Reserve has always been independent of political influence, or that the administration has refrained from talk"

    "keywords": "The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) helped bring Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccine through clinical trials to market. BARDA\u2019s Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures ( DRIVe ) is its in-house biotech venture capital firm , charged with identifying and incubating technologies for U.S. biodefense and preparedness. Today's interviewee is Dr. Sandeep Patel , the Director of DRIVe from March 2020 to March 2024. Patel helped architect the program\u2019s VC-inspired model and led the organization through its COVID response. Is BARDA the best value for money in federal pandemic prevention? Why is it easier to design a new program than fix an old one? How effective is BARDA\u2019s venture capital-style investing? Thanks to Rita Sokolova for her judicious transcript edits. Subscribe For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Most Statecraft readers, I'm guessing, have never heard of BARDA. Square the circle for me \u2013 how is it that BARDA can be so effective and so under the radar? Yeah, BARDA is an interesting organization. It's very specific in what it does. Its mission is to develop medical countermeasures through public-private partnerships for a variety of public health emergencies. It's highly focused on working with industry on the development, testing, and licensure of medical countermeasures. Because it has such a specific goal, I think it does a great job of just getting that done. Stepping back for a second here: BARDA\u2019s close to two decades old. It\u2019s housed within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Specifically, it\u2019s within the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response , which does a bunch of different things related to emergencies and responses. But BARDA is specifically product development with industry. There's no other place in government that does it in that highly focused way. Contracting is everything, right? BARDA has other mechanisms for funding, but it typically operates through R&D contracts. More specifically, it uses milestone-based contracts, where there's some deliverable, and financing gets unlocked after that deliverable. How you structure these contracts, and doing so in a streamlined but responsible way, is really important. BARDA is particularly effective at this and has lots of experienced contracting officers who are good at it. So there is a mechanism to work with industry that no other organization within the government has. There's certainly a web of organizations within the government that fit into this, and BARDA partners with many of them. Some groups, like DARPA and NIH , are earlier funders of the research that feeds into what BARDA eventually does. You also have other organizations that provide information to BARDA and inform its strategy and priorities, like what the CDC might do in terms of surveillance and epidemiological information. The Department of Defense does a lot of product development as well, but the key difference is that the DOD typically focuses on serving the military while BARDA focuses on the U.S. population. A lot of promising vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics would be left in the valley of death. All of the problems that BARDA cares about, like emerging infectious diseases, chemical attacks, and nuclear radiation exposure, are not commercially viable areas. Industry alone is not going to fund the development of medical countermeasures for those things. Absent BARDA, you would see a lot of promising products that aren't licensed and therefore not immediately available for use during emergencies. For example, BARDA funded the vast majority of the COVID vaccine, therapeutic, and diagnostic work as well as for pandemic influenza. It's an overused term, but two things come to mind. One is the clinical trial stage of development for drugs, vaccines, and devices. This is the most capital-intensive stage of development, and one that the private sector is typically less inclined to invest in unless there's a clear market afterwards. For all the stuff that BARDA operates, there is no clear market at the end there. The second valley is the one for products and technologies already commercialized but not necessarily tested for use in specific health emergencies. That could be drug repurposing, or applying novel sensing technologies for infectious disease. Yeah, I think it might be slightly misleading because BARDA\u2019s space is so narrow compared to the entire life sciences industry. BARDA does make large bets and will fund phase three trials for drugs or vaccines on par with industry on a per-product basis. When you relate it to industry overall, like life sciences, it's obviously smaller, but I think it's putting the same amount of money for the development as industry standard. One of the beauties of milestone-based contracts is that, if they're well-designed, they appropriately spread risk across both partners. Rather than having committed ahead of time to the whole thing, you can put in relatively small amounts of money at the beginning and create gates at each stage to decide whether something warrants further investment. This also benefits the partner on the private side who may not know whether they want to proceed. A broader problem in biomedical funding, and probably R&D funding overall, is that we don't create enough certainty about next steps when we fund a development stage or project. The number one question that you get from an awardee is, \u201cIf we're successful, what's next? Do you have more money?\u201d While milestone-based contracts don't solve that problem entirely, they can provide some certainty. I think there are plenty of other circumstances where creating that unlocking step might actually unlock more private capital. If they see some certainty in downstages, they'll be more willing to invest. BARDA does a lot of cost-sharing in its work where it requires money from partners. I think that becomes a valuable risk-sharing mechanism as well. Is that the same dynamic you're talking about here? Yeah, I think it's similar. There's another part of the BARDA apparatus that's important, which is the strategic national stockpile. The stockpile, managed by another group within HHS, stores a portfolio of licensed products for use during emergencies. BARDA has a program called Project BioShield which funds the testing of investigational products to licensure and stockpiling. So that's, in effect, a downstream procurement mechanism that BARDA has, which can create some downstream certainty for developers. It's more complex: there are multiple sites. There's also a vendor-managed inventory, so inventory can exist at a developer's site, and that's considered part of the stockpile as well. And they have a portfolio of products that they support and keep stockpiled. BARDA is one feeding mechanism into the stockpile. BARDA and its partners are highly effective, but there's a major strategic gap in how we prepare for pandemics. We identify and prioritize a bunch of threats . So pandemic influenza, smallpox, Ebola \u2014 we have a variety of lists. But we can always be surprised. And we need to ensure we\u2019re using the best of our current technological capabilities, in ways we may not be able to imagine. This creates the argument for DRIVe, which can invest in new technologies, new innovators, and take risks that the rest of BARDA cannot. There are a couple mechanisms. There's an organization called the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise ( PHEMCE ), which is an interagency organization with various components of HHS and DOD and others, that helps prioritize the threats. The Department of Homeland Security also manages a list of the material threats that they're concerned about. BARDA and other organizations will direct funding based on what's on the list. Yeah, everything from viral pathogens to chemicals that we might be worried about causing harm. Yeah, and this is where DRIVe comes in. When we think about biological threats of the future, like outbreaks of novel pathogens, viruses, fungi, and or other types of threats, there's inevitably going to be a curveball. With SARS-CoV-2, one of the curveballs was asymptomatic transmission. We hadn't been thinking about that or designed a system to respond to that kind of thing, so we had to figure that out during the pandemic. One of the roles that DRIVE plays, especially in this unknown threat landscape, is to ask, \u201cWhat could happen in the future? How could it happen in a way that we might not be able to predict or prepare for effectively? What can we do, threat-agnostically, to better prepare and respond to those scenarios?\u201d DRIVe was set up to invest in technologies to frame those problems out. One example problem is sepsis, which is a dysregulation of the immune system that can follow an infection. No matter what the pathogen is, this is a common mechanism; if we have treatments and diagnostics for it, that prepares us for a variety of threats. Shortly after DRIVe was founded, it created a program called Solving Sepsis that invested in diagnostics and therapeutics, and actually got a couple of products through FDA approval. Another example of DRIVe\u2019s work is around testing. The paradigm for infectious disease testing is that you have to sequence whatever it is you're looking for, and then you develop a targeted diagnostic, like an antigen or PCR test. The strategic problem with this is that it\u2019s inherently reactive: if a new pathogen emerges, you don't have a way to detect or clinically diagnose it. So one of the things that DRIVe focused on was developing a day zero diagnostic, something that's available before we even know what we're looking for. We developed a whole program around metagenomic sequencing, which is often used for surveillance but hadn't been applied to clinical diagnosis. The last example I'll mention, which I think is really important, is a bit different. Most of what BARDA does is invest in new technologies and products and get them out. It's really hard to argue for sufficient funds to invest and prepare for things that haven't happened yet. When an emergency arises, then you can solicit investment and Congress will unlock funds, but it\u2019s often a little too late. Ideally, you want to invest beforehand and avoid this panic/neglect cycle of funding. DRIVe created a program to hedge against this through its public-private venture capital (VC) partnership. The model takes a significant amount of money, say, $500 million \u2014 half of which comes from the government, half from private investors \u2014 and partners with a group to invest in a portfolio of technologies, as a typical VC would. In this case, the investment is specifically directed at projects within the BARDA mission space. So we\u2019re looking for opportunities that will generate revenue, but then creating an evergreen system where the returns on those investments are reinvested into other technologies. Yeah, this gets into platform technologies. For example, an Ebola vaccine has no commercial market other than what the governments would pay for it. Ebola, thankfully, is not something that happens in routine healthcare settings. It's very unpredictable and emergency-based. There's no reimbursement system for treating it and it's not financially attractive to work on. The role that BARDA plays is funding the development of Ebola vaccines. While the product itself doesn't have commercial value, the technology behind it does. mRNA technology is a great example of this that is commercializable, even if the product that BARDA funds isn't. You can imagine new vaccine, treatment, and diagnostic platforms that are all both commercially viable and of interest to national health security. Those are ideal investments for the VC partnership where we're trying to de-risk some of these technologies. They have both a commercial path and a use for BARDA. I think it's a different model \u2013 it's not an ARPA model, and it's not a typical government R&D model either. We operate by programs, similar to the Heilmeier Catechism method, which is a heuristic that DARPA has used for identifying problems to focus on. It differs in the level of funding, which is a bit lower than you would get in a typical ARPA. The other key distinction is that ARPAs have tended to focus on deep tech solutions. I would actually argue that that misses a lot of opportunities. There are a lot of problems that I think an ARPA would dismiss because it requires taking a commercial technology and pivoting it or reframing it. Yeah. And I would argue that that doesn't make it less challenging. A lot of the problems in healthcare are not around the science and development of products, but around adoption. One great example that DRIVe has focused on is trying to commercialize vaccine patches , which can be self-applied to administer vaccines. This is a fairly straightforward problem technologically, but it has yet to be commercialized. DRIVe filled this unique role for BARDA to advance the development of this technology. One important thing about BARDA, which is not so dissimilar from ARPA, is that there's a portfolio of active projects organized by programs. At any given time there are something like 14 R&D programs, each with a portfolio of at least five projects. The teams typically have a program manager, and similarly to ARPAs, there are subject-matter experts, usually contractors but sometimes federal employees borrowed from other groups. Each project team works very closely with their partners. If the scope of a project is to, say, design a device to interpret cough audio signals for signs of infection\u2014which is an active project in the DRIVe portfolio right now\u2014there would be clinical trial experts on the BARDA side that constantly advise the partner on trial design or clinical operations. If manufacturing is part of the scope of a project, we have experts for that too. So a very integrated team forms. The second thing is that the DRIVe team is constantly scouting and taking deal flow from federal partners. So there are lots of conversations with DARPA and other agencies, private investors, and academia to identify potential partnerships. Oh, we have very broad networking. We have DRIVe staff in the Bay Area, Boston, San Diego \u2013 all the major hubs. There's constant interaction with investors and lots of eyes and ears on the ground. We also pioneered a network of startup accelerators across the country, and DRIVe would constantly get flow from these groups about new companies or exciting research, which then flowed to the rest of BARDA. That was a very effective organic network that has actually since been adopted by ARPA-H. 100%. I think the clinical trials process itself is ripe for innovation. And even if you take into account limited budgets and time, the most effective way to test and develop more products is to improve that bottleneck of the clinical trial process. With the COVID response, the part that took the longest was the actual clinical trial. But it's important, right? Because you need to generate sufficient evidence before you proceed. The standards should remain the way they are, but I think there's plenty of opportunity to improve operations so that you could parallelize and more effectively recruit and retain participants in clinical trials. You can leverage adaptive trials that test multiple products. When I was there, DRIVe created a program to help realize decentralized clinical trials and studies. In the U.S., most of the trial infrastructure exists in academic medical centers, which is not where most people go for routine care. That makes things logistically challenging, especially during an emergency. There are a couple of problems with this. One is processing patients, because not enough people run through academic medical centers; for example, rural populations. The other problem is that they're logistically cumbersome and can be complex and bureaucratic to run. Some products are designed for use in your home, urgent care, or retail pharmacy, but we\u2019re not testing the products in those places because we rely on the academic clinical trial infrastructure that's for a hospital center. We're now distributing healthcare in lots of different places but we're not correspondingly improving our trial infrastructure. The opportunity is, \u201cCan we turn decentralized healthcare delivery places into clinical study places as well?\u201d A lot of the infectious disease home diagnostics that were approved during the pandemic \u2014 many of which BARDA funded \u2014 were actually never really tested in the home. Up until the FDA approval, they were tested in more controlled clinical environments, yet they were designed for the home. So there were a lot of issues with usability that they didn't figure out ahead of time. Things like what people do with the test results and how they interpret them. With the antigen test , how do people interpret a half of a red line? That insight would come out in trials that were designed for the home. The pushback is that running trials in more settings makes things complicated for both the participants and the physicians operating the trials. Virtual enrollment, where you enroll on your phone or online, increases the complexity on the ground. The other argument is that it can be more costly. Where you would land is that there are some products that you would want to test in this system and some products that should remain in the traditional system. We need redundancy in our design so that we have different types of infrastructure depending on what we're doing. When I came on board, it was around $25-30 million. That was in year two of its existence, the FY 2020 budget. The baseline budget when I left was about $100 million per year. My primary goal was to grow DRIVe\u2019s staff, budget, and impact. When I joined, there were roughly 10 to 15 people on the team. When I left, there were roughly 60. We also expanded the number of programs and the range of work that we did. In addition to the baseline budget, there was also COVID supplemental money that DRIVe used. DRIVe started with three core programs with that sort of small budget, and based on some of the successes early on, we argued that we needed to do more and put more money in each of the buckets that we had. So we were operating on both at the same time: we were trying to respond to and anticipate how the COVID pandemic might evolve, and at the same time set up some long-term programs. Talent acquisition for the government is always challenging, but DRIVe was specifically designed to try to infuse expertise from industry. We were constantly trying to bring in people who had a lot of experience in the private sector, but little in the public sector. We did a lot of recruiting, a lot of referrals, to generate some excitement. The other challenge with working in the federal government is that, oftentimes, the best people do not want a long-term commitment. You get a lot of people who are mid- to late-career and have enormous amounts of expertise and willingness to contribute to the public sector, but don't want to commit the rest of their lives to working. There\u2019s this assumption that when you work for the government, you're going to be in it for the long haul. We were very intentional about trying to create limited opportunities. ARPAs are known for this model of limited engagement. Yeah, I think we could. There are lots of fellowship programs that exist to get into government, but they're definitely biased towards early career. It would be really helpful to have mid- to late-career fellowships as well. The fellowships are also relatively short-term and project-based, typically a year or two. I think there is a need to bring in people for four- to five-year terms, similar to a program manager at ARPA but across multiple types of roles. A more bureaucratic point is that the government is really bad at describing job roles. When you apply for a job with the"

    "keywords": "The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is the world\u2019s largest emergency supply of crude oil. In huge underground salt caverns along the Gulf of Mexico, the American federal government can store up to 714 million barrels, more than what the country uses in one month. Historically, the SPR has been tapped at the discretion of the president when natural disasters or crises cause the price of oil for consumers to spike. But at the beginning of this decade, prices went haywire: during COVID, they plummeted to negative prices, then skyrocketed when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Colleagues Arnab Datta and Skanda Amarnath proposed a novel idea: what if the SPR wasn\u2019t just used as a stockpile of a commodity? If it used its ability to acquire oil strategically, could it support American industry and calm oil markets? Arnab and Skanda mounted a campaign to convince the Biden administration to use the SPR more aggressively. Today, we talked to both of them. Arnab Datta is my colleague at IFP , our Director of Infrastructure Policy. He\u2019s also Managing Director of Policy Implementation at Employ America , a macroeconomic think tank committed to full employment. Skanda is Executive Director there. Why isn\u2019t the oil in the SPR its most valuable asset? Why should green energy advocates want to support oil producers? When is aggressive rhetoric a good idea for policy advocates? How do you convince a presidential administration to take a risk? Does elite media actually matter? An SPR site in Brazoria, Texas Subscribe For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: Skanda Amarnath: Oil is the deepest commodity in the world and has the deepest futures market. There are different grades of crude oil: heavy, light, sweet, sour, you hear all those different phrases. But oil is fungible. It's a highly globalized market. And oil is highly relevant to macroeconomic outcomes: the most obvious one is inflation. If you think about headline inflation numbers, they tend to be a function of oil prices. So it's part of the material existence of the world, and yet it's also a highly traded commodity. It's highly volatile compared to, let's say, stocks. The SPR has largely been a \u201cbreak glass in case of emergency\u201d tool, and historically that means releasing oil from the reserve onto the market in response to particular exogenous shocks. And the threshold for an emergency has been very high. At the historically highest peak of oil prices, which is still the summer of 2008, the SPR was basically not utilized. There are occasional circumstances when small-scale releases were conducted for small geopolitical shocks, like with the Libyan civil war in the early 2010s, and some national disasters. But by and large, this asset has largely been underutilized. We\u2019ve done releases, but the SPR\u2019s acquisition authority hasn\u2019t been used strategically at all. SA: There's a famous quote from Exxon CEO Lee Raymond that oil prices on average are $40, but in any given year, they never average $40. Either prices are much higher because of a tight market, or prices crash in a surplus market. You get these big swings in price. In May 2020 we had negative oil prices. On the eve of the financial crisis in 2008, we had oil prices in the $120 a barrel range. Around the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we saw oil prices spike up again to the $120 range. And these swings can actually be quite sustained. You can have a long period of low oil prices, and a long period of high prices. Because it takes time to drill for and successfully produce oil, the price you see today is not the price you'll necessarily sell your oil at in the future. Arnab Datta: Commodity markets all tend to be pretty capital-intensive up front. It takes a lot to justify an investment. In the aggregate, each successive cycle tends to lead to more parsimonious investment. We saw this when we had this big boom in shale production, where we became the world\u2019s largest producer. A lot of producers went bankrupt in the price war that followed , when Saudi Arabia pushed a lot of supply onto the market and crashed the price. If you're a producer, under-investing can lead to a suboptimal return, but over-investment can lead to bankruptcy. When you think about those two choices, it's pretty obvious where you're going to fall. And we saw this dynamic as prices were rising through 2022. Even after the Russian invasion, investment was much less responsive to prices than it had been in previous cycles. This is a problem that can get worse over time. AD: If you looked at our pieces online, it would seem like our timing was just perfect. But in reality, Skanda had been looking at the drop off in oil investment that happened as a result of COVID, and was worried about an upside risk if we had this strong jobs recovery. He'd been thinking about this for a while. We explored a lot of ideas that are not published anywhere. SA: In 2020, we had really low oil prices because of a price war, because COVID had destroyed demand rapidly. Russia and Saudi Arabia could not get along, and it had led to a total glut. You had Ted Cruz saying , \u201cTurn those tankers around.\u201d Subsequently, oil prices began recovering. But something had changed in 2021: the elasticity of investment to price was not what it had been over the latter half of the 2010s. A lot of people from 2014 onwards were enamored of the idea that shale had changed the game forever. Shale production in the United States meant, they thought, that we could be a swing producer: when prices weren't sufficiently high, shale producers would come in, invest enough to produce in seven to nine months, and that would keep prices in a reasonably healthy range. Now, there are ways to monitor that in real-time, by checking different indicators of investment. There\u2019s weekly rig counts, there\u2019s filings from publicly traded companies and so on: and we were just seeing lower investment appetite in 2021. Before 2020, every time shale production was being scaled up, the price would not be to the expectations and forecasts of shareholders. They basically overproduced too much, relative to where the price was, for much of the latter 2010s. CEOs and CFOs were explicitly saying, \u201cWe\u2019re very good at producing oil. But from 2014-2020, we've been very bad at producing profit and return to our shareholders. Therefore, we are going to be a lot more disciplined about how much we're going to invest.\u201d This is called capital discipline: the idea of highly constraining the outright level of investment to make sure that you will earn a profit. Will you earn the most profit? Maybe not. But will you earn a profit? Yes. If shareholders don't trust management to be able to produce optimally, it's nice to know that there's a lower bound on profitability, even if you're giving away some of the upside of not scaling up production more. That's a pattern we had noticed in 2021. There was something going on well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine that made us worry. AD: The DOE had announced a tactical exchange of oil in late 2021, so there was clearly interest in doing something with the SPR. We have a suite of ideas that we're kicking around, using several different legal authorities, and then Russia invades Ukraine. With Russia going offline, one of the largest oil producers in the world, that itself was pushing prices way up. A release made sense to address that, but a release is a one-time thing. That weekend, we put together a memo. We were up most of Saturday night kicking this thing back and forth. The idea we centered on was to utilize the SPR, particularly acquisition in the SPR, to create certain demand for future production. If you could signal to producers that \u201cWe will purchase at a certain price,\u201d that would be enough to create more investment. You could pair that signal with immediate releases now, when prices are very high, to relieve some of the price pressure that folks are feeling as crude oil prices spiked. SA : There are those who thought, \u201cIt's a drop in the bucket. It's not going to matter, and even if it does, you are also destroying the price signal and the investment signal that's vital to getting out of this on a more sustained basis.\u201d And it\u2019s true: there's only so much oil in the SPR that you can release to lower the price, but it does have an effect. But on the investment point, investment in oil production is not just a function of the price today. There's actually uncertainty about the future price. That uncertainty about the future price is not straightforward for oil producers to hedge against, even with deep futures and derivatives markets. But if you can make investing in the future less risky, that\u2019s an important input for investment in future production. How could the SPR be used to do that? This is where we wanted to push the idea of making a credible commitment to future purchases, which would help unlock more investment even at a lower price. AD: The week Russia invaded Ukraine, we happened to be at the tail end of a call with a friend of ours, Alex Jacquez at the National Economic Council (NEC), who said to us, basically as a throwaway, \u201cIf you guys have any ideas on oil prices, we're all ears.\u201d We said, \u201cWe do, actually,\u201d and we wrote that memo up over the weekend. That Monday, we sent it over to Alex, Bharat Ramamurti , Vivek Viswanathan at the NEC, and Peter Harrell at the National Security Council (NSC), just to put it on their radar. And we had a number of calls with folks at the NEC to talk through the regulatory challenges they\u2019d face to achieve that. We then huddled with our colleague, Alex Williams , to develop a public version that was framed more broadly in the context of energy and decarbonization. We were able to generate some media about that piece. And in May, the administration announced the largest release in history: 180 million barrels coming out of the SPR and a huge amount coming from global reserves. But importantly, in that release, they basically endorsed the conceptual framework for what we were calling for: they were going to explore rulemaking at DOE in their acquisition process that would allow them to do fixed-price forward contracts, which would provide a signal to domestic producers to invest. SA: Vivek and Lisa Hansmann had given us a call just to say, paraphrasing, \u201cLook, your ideas are getting a lot of traction, and we're going to be working to change the regulation so we can do this kind of flexible repurchase.\u201d That was a sign of confirmation that, beyond a press release, we were having an effect. AD: Prior to this rule change, the SPR\u2019s acquisitions were tied to a market index, and that market index was based on the spot price of that day. Before this rule change, you could do a 9-month or a 12-month forward contract, but the producer would be vulnerable to price risk. Prices may drop by that future date, and the producer is locked into a worse price. We needed DOE to be allowed to move away from that index system. They could still use this index system, but they could also fix the price at the time of the solicitation agreement. So DOE can put a solicitation out, can agree to a price right now for delivery nine months in the future, and, regardless of what happens in the oil markets, it can commit to acquiring at that price. This was also something that protects the DOE from upside risk, too. Both sides are getting something useful out of this. AD: Some people would argue that. The last time the regulations were changed was 2007, during the Bush administration. But if you examine the statutory authority of the SPR \u2014 which I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with \u2014 42 U.S. Code \u00a7 6240 , a lot of the language about the purpose of the SPR goes beyond merely storing crude for an emergency. There's a specific acquisition authority with objectives that should be met, like \u201cpromoting domestic competition\u201d and \u201cavoiding price harm for American consumers.\u201d The procedures require that acquisitions support maximum domestic crude oil production. These are all priorities that are meant to be balanced when thinking about the overall purpose of acquisition, and that's right in the statute. So part of our argument was that our proposed rule change was very much aligned with the original statutory intent of the SPR. Specific, statutory language demonstrates that this is not only lawfully allowed, but even required in certain cases. SA: This is a good example of how legal equilibria sometimes are a function of rational deliberation, and sometimes it's a bit of a vestige of particular premises of the past. A longer-term fixed-price forward contract only makes sense if there's actually an investment signal you want to put out to the market, which requires a market to exist. In the 80s, futures markets were in their infancy. In May, the administration announced DOE is going to do a rulemaking, so that it can more easily do fixed price forward contracts. In May and June, oil prices and refined product prices are very high. But a DOE \u201cnotice of proposed rulemaking,\u201d which is the step DOE had to undertake to kick off the formal rulemaking process: It just didn't happen. There was focus on a lot of other things. We got a bit frustrated, and we also expressed it externally. We did a pretty long and broad media offensive to say, \u201cThis is a place where we could have a lot of effect on gas prices.\u201d Some people in the White House may have taken that a bit more, uh, harshly than we intended. But it was a moment of conflict. A fixed-price futures contract for the SPR is the vanilla idea. I will also add that we had more creative ideas. That level of complexity may have spooked some folks at the DOE. We don't have full confirmation here, but we had some ideas that we may have run up against some of the bureaucratic inertia, the general risk preferences of those within the DOE and maybe even at the NEC for something simpler that would not feel as spooky, not feel as vulnerable to error, simply because the change would be so large. There is definitely a bureaucratic preference for incrementalism, which makes a lot of sense. It's important to have some level of bureaucratic empathy: these civil servants and political appointees are also subject to oversight investigations and inquiries. The Bush administration NEC had all kinds of creative ideas for refilling the SPR whenever there was a release. They were subject to some pretty harsh investigations from Democrats in Congress and the Government Accountability Office, and that effectively chilled a lot of policy innovation and creativity at that time. It's something that can come across on both sides of the aisle. I think we were successful in patching that up with the NEC, and to some extent also the DOE. Our tone was a little harsh, but it also made a very clear point. The more we went to the media to say, \u201cThis is something we could do in the here and now,\u201d the more we could show this was legal and feasible, that it could fit the political constraints the administration was facing, and the economic constraints American producers were facing: the more pressure it put on those who consume the media within the administration. AD: We hadn\u2019t heard from them after May 2022. Going into July, Skanda had done a couple of podcasts where his tone had shifted more negative. We got an email from some folks there saying, \u201cWe'd love to talk to you about SPR.\u201d We hopped on the phone and some of the folks we'd talked to kind of voiced that, like, \u201cWe hear you, we're trying to make this work.\u201d They requested that we try to be a bit more civil, but they also gave us a pathway going forward. A guy named Neale Mahoney got hired to the NEC, and he basically took over the SPR portfolio. I think some folks had told him to leverage us, and explained the rough contours of what we were trying to do. Neale was incredibly responsive, and we got more into figuring out the implementation details. Having someone who owned it and owned the relationship with us helped light a fire for them. With any policy advocacy effort from the outside, you want a champion on the inside. Neale became that. SA: Having him directly involved also helped us communicate the potential scale of impact this could have. At the time, I think the perception was, \u201cOkay, it's a cool idea, but it's really a drop in the bucket. The SPR is only so large, and even if you did all these releases and buybacks, so much oil is produced globally in a day that dwarfs it.\u201d People assumed the SPR is irrelevant at the scale it operates. I don't think that is conventional wisdom now. Actually, what matters for oil prices is what's going on at the margin. Marginal supply-demand imbalances are what matter, and SPR releases and acquisitions could be relevant on that scale, even if that\u2019s small compared to how much the U.S. or Saudi Arabia produce in the aggregate. Here\u2019s a line from a research report of yours : \u201cThe overall size of the market or volume of production does not drive prices . Price is driven far more by the size of the gap between global supply and global demand.\u201d That seems not obvious until you actually lay it out. AD: Yeah. That was the first piece in a series we did called Contingent Supply , where we explored a lot of these issues. Both externally and internally, we had to give folks the language to understand this. We don't want to oversell what the SPR can do; this is not going to be the new OPEC. But we have considerable capabilities. One point we made in that piece was, historically, the asset of the SPR was seen as the crude itself. But as we became the world's largest producer and a net exporter, our vulnerability to fluctuations in crude supply shrunk. The real asset in the SPR is the storage capability, because you can use that to have some impact on the market. We tried to show people that, even amidst periods of price volatility, the thing that really drives the price volatility is the imbalance between supply and demand. That number rarely gets above 2 million barrels a day. Sometimes it can be 500,000: that changes prices quite a bit. That's where the SPR becomes really powerful. Theoretically, its intake capacity is 685,000 barrels a day. That's not a small number. That can move prices in a considerable way if you can take in the oil. There are logistical challenges associated with doing that. But the number of barrels you can take into the SPR is something that directly affects the market. From a piece by the interviewees, Contingent Supply: The SPR Is More Equipped Than Ever to Stabilize Oil Prices SA: One key thing: oil storage is not a trivial consideration. Oil is typically stored for inventory purposes on a short-term basis. Storing oil for a long duration requires specialized capabilities. The SPR has these massive underground salt caverns for storage, but it took time to build those out. Long-duration storage is not generally super economical for the private sector to invest in. SA: How much do you have to spend to build those facilities, and what return will you get on them? You\u2019d need an ungodly amount of leverage for something super capital-intensive, generally not a wise idea. And you\u2019re not going to deliver a huge return to shareholders from creating private-sector salt caverns. This is a pretty special capability that the U.S. has available. Vacant storage has its own value, because in the event of particular price and supply conditions, it can be a contingent acquirer of oil. People think that the barrels of oil in the caverns are the precious bit. But they\u2019re not. The precious bit is the fact that you have salt caverns that can store oil for long periods of time. This was something really underappreciated. The notice of proposed rulemaking finally came out in July of 2022, so there were about two months before that during which we saw some interest in other policy ideas that struck us as a lack of focus. But folks like Brian Deese , for example, were very inve"

    "keywords": "In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson suffered a major stroke. The president, a widower, was kept in solitude by his second wife and a tight ring of advisers. For months, senior executive branch and legislative officials could not see the president. The White House claimed the president would shortly return to full health, and that he suffered only from \u201cnervous exhaustion.\u201d His wife managed the flow of information to him, sharing certain memos and concealing others. The president was desperate to cement his legacy and did not consider resigning. In fact, he felt confident he could run for another term despite his acute medical condition. In an open convention, the Democratic Party took 44 ballots to choose his successor. In the subsequent general election, Warren Harding won with the largest popular vote margin ever for a Republican candidate. Noting the parallels between recent events and Wilson\u2019s story, we spoke to John Milton Cooper Jr. , a historian who has been called \"the world's greatest authority on Woodrow Wilson.\" Cooper is Professor Emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His Woodrow Wilson: A Biography was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. How did the White House hide the president\u2019s condition from Congress and the public? How did the Democratic Party handle his commitment to run for president again? Was the president fully aware of his own condition? How were affairs of state managed while the president was incapacitated? Subscribe Download as PDF Yes, starting in the 1890s, but there's a bit of controversy about it. What we're dealing with is mainly anecdotal evidence. You don't get any kind of medical examination of Wilson until 1906. The earlier ones, he probably had what we would now call TIAs, transient ischemic attacks, relatively little things. The earliest incident that we have real medical evidence about was in 1906, while he was president of Princeton. He woke up one morning and found he had lost most of the vision in one eye, which was very disturbing. He went to Philadelphia and was examined by both an ophthalmologist and a neurologist, Dr. Francis Durcum . They found hardening of the arteries, evidence that Wilson had a circulatory condition with neurological consequences. The advice they gave him was: quit work, no stress, and so forth. Given the kind of, shall we say, driving person that Wilson was, he didn't like that. He took the advice, to the extent that he took off and did a long holiday biking summer adventure in Scotland by himself. He was examined then by a leading neurologist in Edinburgh, and that doctor said to him, \u201cNo, you can keep on working, just pace yourself, be sensible.\u201d He was hearing what he wanted to hear, so that's the advice he followed. Now, some argue \u2014 and I've argued this myself \u2014 that after that, Wilson became more driven. In other words, this was a marker, a warning sign. That's the one that we have real evidence for. Now, there are some other times that he reported numbness and things like this. It's hard to say what they really were. The prevailing view among historians and biographers is that Dr. Weinstein, who wrote a very good medical and psychological biography of Wilson , overdiagnosed him. The book reads as if every time Wilson had a cough, that\u2019s immediately a sign of neurological decline. It's hard to say. When I wrote a book about the fight over the League of Nations, I was teaching at the University of Wisconsin, and I consulted with a friend of mine, the chair of the med school neurology department. I had him read some of the relevant documents, and he said that, in terms of ability to perform, people who suffer strokes like Wilson's can be going on almost all cylinders. They can be at 90% or so right up to the time that it happens. Wilson also had a bad bout of something, which I think was pretty clearly flu, when he was at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Evidently his behavior changed, and he became a bit more testy and suspicious. Again, these are anecdotes that come out and then, aha, after the fact, they seem to indicate things. When Wilson suffered the stroke, he had been out on a whirlwind barnstorming tour across America to try to sell the League of Nations. He basically broke down. He just couldn't continue. So they curtailed the trip and brought him back to Washington where he was secluded in the White House. Now, the wisdom at the time was to deal with strokes with seclusion, quiet, rest. Carry Grayson , the White House physician, later claimed that he was suspecting a stroke. That's hard to say. Grayson kept one diary at the Peace Conference, which is one of the major sources for what Wilson was doing and thinking. We have the original diary in a manuscript. The diary for later, there's only a typescript, and I've suspected \u2014 and I'm sorry for the pun \u2014 that Grayson may have doctored it a bit, in order to claim that he saw the stroke coming. No, that he showed the signs that he might be suffering a stroke in advance of his return to the White House. One thing that I think you can say definitively about Wilson's physical condition is that he was not at his best. He had really worn himself out at the peace conference. It'd be these 12, 14-hour days of negotiation and hard bargaining, It was really difficult. I recently read Robert Kagan's The Ghost at the Feast , a very good book. I wrote a fan email to Kagan and said, \u201cI wonder if the fight over the League of Nations might have turned out differently if Wilson had been at the top of his game.\u201d Because if you look at Wilson in that first term, it was remarkable. I mean, this man is one of the great politicians, one of the great leaders of American history. Yale presidential scholar Steve Skowronek once called this \u201ca virtuoso performance,\u201d which it was. Now, if Wilson had been on the top of his game that way, you can't say things would have turned out completely differently. But certainly, the events would have gone differently. Well, anyway, they secluded him, and he was apparently functional. He watched movies, he played pool, and, you know, kind of kept quiet. And then, about five days after they returned to Washington, that's when he suffered the stroke. There are several accounts of it. What I believe happened was that he suffered it in the night, didn't know it, woke up, tried to walk across the bedroom to the bathroom, and slumped down. Others believe he was in the bathroom, had a sudden stroke, and fell and cut his head. I'll give Grayson credit for this foresight: he had already called for Dr. Durcum to come and examine Wilson. That appointment was already in the works. When the stroke happened, Grayson got on the phone to Durcum immediately and asked him to come right away. So Durcum did. Grayson met him at the train station, briefed him in the car going there and Durcum examined Wilson. We have one of the country's leading neurologists examining the president within hours of his stroke. Durcum said the kind of stroke that Wilson suffered was an ingravescent stroke. That means the kind of stroke that's caused by clots, as opposed to a hemorrhagic stroke, or what is called apoplexy. We have a better idea of what ailed Wilson than for just about any other president before, because of these detailed, contemporaneous medical records. Now, there's a story that Mrs. Wilson asked Durcum, \u201cWell, what should we do? Should the president resign, and Vice President Marshall become president?\u201d And she says that Durcum said, \u201cOh, no, no, Mrs. Wilson. No, no, no. He should work. Staying on his work is the best thing for him.\u201d Well, in his book, Weinstein absolutely correctly says that is something that no responsible medical professional would say. Edith Wilson's motivations and behavior, we can get into that in a bit. What made the effects of the stroke so bad was not only the stroke itself. That's the underlying condition. But, a few days after that, from what little we know, Wilson was not that incapacitated. He had this paralysis, but he was fully conscious, he was being informed of what was going on. In fact, the Cabinet was meeting without him, and he didn't like it and made his dislike known to them and shut that down. But a few days after the stroke, he suffered a urinary tract infection that became life-threatening \u2014 he had a high fever, in and out of consciousness. The big question was, surgery or not? Do we operate or don't we? Obviously, surgery on a person of his age and physical condition was dangerous. They called in a Dr. Young from Johns Hopkins, a specialist who advised against the surgery, and he said, \u201cLet's try something else,\u201d which was to use hot compresses to try to loosen up the obstruction. It worked, but that whole episode debilitated him more. When my neurologist friend read these different documents, he was particularly interested in the psychological effects of the stroke. He thought an awful lot of Wilson's strange behavior when he was back to some degree of activity was the consequence of solitude. He said, \u201cThat's exactly what they don't do now for stroke victims.\u201d The medical wisdom at the time called for solitude, nothing to upset them. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cWhat they try to do is get stroke victims into social interaction as soon as they can and get them back into as close to normal life as they can.\u201d He really thought the psychological effects on Wilson were probably as much due to solitude as to the stroke itself. He became, at times, very rigid about any thought of compromise. This is where you get into the historians and scholars arguing about this. A number of them see that rigidity and go, \u201cAha, that\u2019s the real Wilson.\u201d I don't agree with that. I see a man who could be very flexible, willing to go in for give and take. He did have tendencies that way [ toward rigidity ]. There's no question about that. He also knew it, and worked to counteract that. I think the major psychological effect was that after the stroke he didn\u2019t have those \u201cguardrails\u201d to keep him from getting too rigid. Evidently the effect of the solitude was that he remembered being out on the tour where he attracted big crowds and lots of applause. And in his solitude, it gave him the \u2014 I'd say delusion \u2014 that the country was with him and that he could carry this off. It is quite true that he became the biggest barrier to compromise. There might have been \u2014 might, I would say might \u2014 have been some kind of compromise with some of the senators so that we could have gone into the League of Nations with reservations. There's more to it than just Wilson being stubborn, of course. But that was a major psychological change. And then, when you talk about delusional, he at various times thought of running again for president. Yes. And not only then. In 1924, just before his death that year, he was already planning a run for the Democratic nomination, and even outlined some planks for a platform. One of his collaborators on that, by the way, was one of the three men he appointed to the Supreme Court, his most distinguished appointment, Louis Brandeis . Brandeis drafted some of these planks for him too. Wilson\u2019s attempted run before the 1920 convention was something that Mrs. Wilson, [ Wilson\u2019s private secretary ] J oseph Tumulty , Dr. Grayson, Senator Carter Glass, who had just been Secretary of the Treasury, all had to work to quash. Wilson had appointed Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby , who was not a very distinguished appointment and frankly something of a yes man to Wilson. Colby had plans, Wilson said, to stampede the convention in Wilson\u2019s favor. Grayson rode down to Union Station with Senator Glass when he was leaving for the Democratic Convention in San Francisco, and stayed on the train until it was pulling out, basically instructing Glass: \u201cSmother this thing. He is in no condition, absolutely no condition for this. This has to be stopped.\u201d I know \u201cdelusional\u201d is a loaded term, but there it is. Now, what you also have to remember is that he wasn't always that way. He had mood swings. He had better days and not-so-good days. But he was not fully functional as president. He simply was not. Well, let's say spin rather than fiction. Siebold was one of two or three star reporters for the New York World , which was the leading Democratic paper in the country, and was as distinguished as the New York Times . I've done research in this era, and I've used both of them, and often the political reporting in the World is better than the Times . So obviously Siebold was very sympathetic. And it was stage-managed, very much. By the way, that's not the only stage-managed thing. After he suffered the stroke, the White House spokespersons, Dr. Grayson, etc, never, never used the word \u201cstroke.\u201d They said it was \u201cnervous exhaustion,\u201d that kind of stuff. Well, obviously, nature abhors a vacuum, so all kinds of rumors started circulating, including that Wilson had gone mad. \u201cYou see those bars on the White House windows? You know why those bars are there?\u201d That's right, for their baseballs, you had to protect the windows. Anyway, what the Senators did was, the Foreign Relations Committee cooked up an excuse to go see Wilson. Stuff involving troubles in Mexico. Exactly, in early December. Just once, before the League of Nations treaty came up for a vote at the middle of November 1919, the Democratic leader in the Senate, Gilbert Hitchcock of Nebraska, got to see Wilson. And Wilson gave the orders: \u201cNo compromise, not with the Lodge Reservations .\u201d So the treaty failed. Anyway, they cooked up an excuse for two senators to come and see Wilson. The newspapers dubbed it \u201cThe Smelling Committee.\u201d In other words, they were going to smell him out. The two of them were Hitchcock, the Democrat, and Albert Fall from New Mexico, a Republican, later Secretary of the Interior. The two of them sent the request and they figured, \u201cThey're going to stall us,\u201d Instead, they got an answer: \u201cCome this afternoon.\u201d So they did. Now, this was really stage-managed. The accounts differ over the bedroom\u2019s lighting: some say it was in the shadows, others say there was plenty of light. They had Wilson in bed, with the bed covers covering his left side, the paralyzed side. He was next to a bedside table, which had documents on it, and he reached over at one point and referred to the documents as if he had read them, which he had not. The whole thing was a snow job. It was stage-managed. The cat got out of the bag, finally, in early February 1920, when Dr. Young, the urologist who had been there for the blockage, just casually said, \u201cOh yeah, well, he suffered a stroke.\u201d That\u2019s how it became public knowledge, although the White House never, never acknowledged it. Nobody from the White House ever used the word stroke. But it was a terrible coverup. Not the only one, interestingly. Franklin Roosevelt was in seclusion for six or eight weeks in the spring of 1944. He was down at Bernard Baruch 's estate in South Carolina, and the only public statement out of him at that time was a very short radio blurb about D-Day. And that's all. So this is not the only time that we've had blackout curtains around a president. Kristie Miller, who has written a very good dual biography of the two Mrs. Wilsons, his first and second wives, once said she considered Edith\u2019s book My Memoir a work of fiction. There's a new book that I strongly recommend called Untold Powe r , which is about Edith Wilson, by Rebecca Roberts, Cokie Roberts \u2019 daughter. I think Rebecca Roberts is the first one who tries to paint Edith in a good light. I think that's right. Let's say \u2014 I'm not granting this \u2014 but if Wilson was not going to resign or be removed, and if somebody was going to act as a surrogate for him \u2014 those are big ifs, and I don't concede those \u2014 but positing those, Edith Wilson was the best-equipped person to do it. She knew his mind and his moods better than anybody else. From the time that he courted her, he had been sharing the secrets of state, innermost decisions with her, so she knew it better than anybody else. And if you ask, given these terrible circumstances, how does she do? I think the answer is, not bad. Not great. This shouldn't have happened. Wilson should have resigned. There should have been some mechanism for at least temporary removal, which there wasn't. But she was in this position. Now, the major criticism that's been leveled at her is that she put his health and his well-being above that of the country and the world. And she kind of says that herself in my memoir. But, the other thing is, she knew his mind better than anybody else, and she knew what he would want, particularly those first weeks when he was genuinely out of it. I mean, look, we've got President Biden right now claiming he will not resign. People can be very stubborn, even presidents, in that situation. What Rebecca points out, and I think is well taken, is that Edith claims in My Memoir that she never made a decision herself, never usurped anything. And you know the line from Hamlet , \u201cThe lady doth protest too much.\u201d What she does admit in My Memoir is that she controlled access of people and information to him. Well, we all know, don't we, that he or she who controls access to the president to some extent is president. And that's what she did. By December, he's having more interactions, getting more information, and more people are seeing him. But not a lot. Again, we did not have a fully functioning president for those 17 months after the stroke. This was obviously not a good condition, not a good thing at all, and it was covered up. It's like Watergate. What's worse, the original incident or the coverup? Well, they're both terrible. For quite a while, the only people who saw him were his medical attendants, Mrs. Wilson, and the immediate family, his daughters. It was a very, very small circle. As Edith says, when serious matters came, demanding the president's attention, she would often put them aside, and she said, \u201cI didn't want to upset him.\u201d An awful lot of stuff just wasn\u2019t getting through. When Senator Hitchcock finally got in to see him, this is mid-November before the Treaty votes, Wilson was surprised that Hitchcock told him it wasn't going to pass without the rest of the Lodge Reservations. Wilson wouldn't believe it. In other words, he wasn't getting the information. He was secluded. Those kinds of things just weren't getting to him. That situation improved gradually and it got better. I'll give you an example though, of what he didn't know, starting in. Right at the end of 1919, the beginning of 1920, we get the infamous Red Scare . Wilson did not know about it. At the first cabinet meeting, after the stroke, which was in April 1920, he turned to his attorney general and the architect of the Red Scare, Mitchell Palmer. He said, \u201cPalmer, don't let this country see red.\u201d Well, guess what? That's what Palmer had been doing all along. Just an awful lot of stuff that he should have known about was being kept from him. It limped along. Part of this is, at least up till the stroke. Wilson is a very strong president. He's not a laid-back, easygoing one. But he does not fit our model of a strong president. Our model of the strong president, which I think has some problems with it, is based really pretty much on FDR and LBJ: somebody who is constantly getting his fingers into everything, often micromanaging, often bullying. Throw a little Theodore Roosevelt in there too. The problem with that model, of course, is that in these cases a strong president is defined as somebody who's pushing the country in a liberal, progressive direction. I don't think the model of a strong presidency has yet really contended with Ronald Reagan. Wilson, he'd been a college president, and his leadership at Princeton, in Trenton as governor, and then in the White House, was generally collegiate. He gave a lot of room to his cabinet members. Sometimes his beliefs were not quite borne out"

Zubok\u2019s big thesis is that the collapse of the USSR wasn\u2019t inevitable \u2014 had Gorbachev made better decisions, he could have liberalized while keeping the Union together. This was my first deep dive into the end of the Soviet Union, so I can\u2019t fully judge his specific argument (although over the past couple of years, I\u2019ve enjoyed reading about Russia in general. In particular, I liked Imperium by Ryszard Kapuscinski, Statecraft guest John Lechner\u2019s book on the Wagner Group, Statecraft guest Edward Luttwak\u2019s book on Soviet grand strategy, Stalin\u2019s War by Sean McMeekin, and the 1917 chapter in Crane Brinton\u2019s Anatomy of Revolution .

I\u2019m hoping to read Pipes\u2019 The Russian Revolution later this year, and would run a book club if there\u2019s sufficient interest.) Interested in a book club? But on the possibility of keeping the Union together, Zubok makes a compelling case. In particular, he thinks that the staging of liberalizing reforms matters, and that you can blow an otherwise workable scheme by not sequencing properly. In particular, Gorbachev loosens restrictions on how state-run enterprises can invest their profits, as well as on capital flows to the West. The result is the selling off of productive assets (looting) before there\u2019s a free internal market or a stable currency to support productive liberalization. I thought there was an interesting parallel to DOGE\u2019s sequencing of reforms. As I\u2019ve argued elsewhere in this newsletter , many of the aggressive personnel moves made by DOGE, cutting headcount in various agencies, only make sense as efficiency measures once you\u2019ve already reduced the procedural and regulatory burden on those agencies. Otherwise, you\u2019re asking the same agency to continue to perform the same functions with the same tools, only with less capacity. Multiple DOGE team members are now working on versions of that deregulatory project within the federal government, and I\u2019m hopeful there will be some value created there. But if the sequencing had been reversed, it would have made a lot more sense, and likely built more political capital. Multiple plausible economic liberalization plans were put forward (the Petrakov program, Yavlinsky\u2019s \u201c400 Days of Confidence\u201d), but no politician had the stomach for them. Additionally, no one in Gorbachev\u2019s generation had any stomach for the use of force \u2014 not Gorbachev, not Yeltsin, not the neo-Stalinist coup leaders in the fall of 1991 \u2014 even when force would have been in their political interests. If you read Svetlana Alexievich , you know how many true believers in communism remained even in the 1980s. But apparently, that true belief isn\u2019t totalizing for the coup plotters: after the coup fails, only a couple kill themselves. Gorbachev was a fascinating character: far more beloved in the West than in his home country, a brilliant procedural politician but without the stamina or dedication to see reforms through, a Leninist who wants to bring down state communism. Zubok paints him ultimately as a fool, unable to come to grips with the process he sets in motion. The book says the tax on alcohol constituted 1/3rd of Soviet GDP. That seemed impossible, and of course it is. There are sources that argue that 1/3rd of Soviet government revenue came from alcohol, but those sources are contested too: the true number seems smaller by at least half. It reminds me of the recent debate over whether firewood constituted 30% of American GDP in 1830. A lesson from reading history: if a claim seems impossible, it often is. Go check. Regardless, the amount of drinking in this book is remarkable. Yeltsin is incoherently drunk by midday, regularly. The US had excellent insight into what\u2019s going on in the USSR, comparatively \u2014 HW Bush talks to Gorbachev and Yeltsin regularly, Baker talks to his counterparts, etc. Lots of Western news media in Moscow by \u201891. Yet the collapse is still a surprise to the West right up until it actually happens, and well after it\u2019s understood to be a fait accompli by everyone except Gorbachev. It\u2019s just hard to make predictions (see the latest Statecraft on this). A great episode with canny former President Nixon: he flies to Moscow to meet with both Gorbachev and Yeltsin, but they say they\u2019re busy. So he has a loud conversation in his hotel lobby about a future meeting with Yeltsin. The KGB overhears, reports it back to Gorbachev, who suddenly finds time that very day to meet with Nixon. Nixon\u2019s people then call Yeltsin\u2019s people back and let them know that he'll be meeting with Gorbachev, and Yeltsin\u2019s people rush to schedule their own meeting. Even the democratic Russian reformers are desperate to keep Crimea and Ukraine in the national divorce (Solzhenitsyn is the most well-known example of this). All in all, an excellent read, albeit a tiny bit stiff at times. Five stars. Zubok has a new book out on the history of the Cold War (and an episode of Odd Lots that I will be checking out next.

    "keywords": "In April and May 1979, between 66 and 300 people died from anthrax in the Russian city of Sverdlovsk, now called Yekaterinburg. The Soviet authorities seized doctors\u2019 records and quickly rolled out an explanation: the deaths were an accident caused by contaminated meat. But American intelligence agencies suspected a more nefarious explanation: the Soviets were secretly developing biological weapons. Last week, we interviewed Matthew Meselson about his key role in convincing Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon to ban biological weapons research in the early 1970s. After the Sverdlovsk incident, Meselson was brought in by the CIA to help assess the potential explanations. For more than a decade, he led scientific investigations into the incident. In 1992, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the truth finally came out: the Sverdlovsk incident was a bioweapons lab leak, the most deadly confirmed lab leak in history. Meselson (center) with Russian investigators, mapping anthrax victim grave sites Meselson\u2019s paper confirming the lab leak is an epidemiological classic. For the first time on Statecraft , we\u2019ve doubled up on a guest: the 94-year-old Meselson is back for round two. How closely does the Sverdlovsk lab leak parallel incidents in Wuhan? How close are we to genetically targeted biological weapons? Why didn\u2019t the Soviets know the location of their own research facilities? For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: I'll start by telling you how I got involved in the Sverdlovsk anthrax outbreak. I was asked by a man at the Central Intelligence Agency named Julian Hoptman , who was in charge of a small unit dealing with biological threats, to come down and become part of this small working group. They had just learned about this anthrax epidemic and naturally wanted to know what it was. I got very close to Julian because at Langley, in Virginia, where the CIA is, there was no hotel. He invited me to stay at his house, because his daughter's bedroom was not being used. I got to talk to Julian a lot, both in the office and also at home, where we didn't talk about classified stuff. And the kinds of evidence we had were: first, there was a particular hospital, Number 40 in Sverdlovsk, which had anthrax patients. Now, how did we know that? There was a physician who was in Sverdlovsk during the anthrax outbreak who then emigrated to Israel, and in Israel, he made contact with the agency. He was one source of information, because he had actually been there and had friends in the medical community. He himself did not attend any of the patients, but his view was that it was inhalation and not gastrointestinal. Whereas the Russians were saying, \u201cYes, there has been an outbreak,\u201d but they claimed it was gastrointestinal. They published one article with a lot of information in a law journal called Chelovek , which means \u201cMan and the Law.\u201d It was about a lady who lived south of Sverdlovsk whose cow got anthrax, and she had committed a crime by dumping this dead cow into a well. There was another article in a veterinary journal about the outbreak of anthrax in sheep and cattle, and it named some villages. I don't think anybody but me tried to find out where these villages were, because they're little teeny nothing villages, but somehow I found out. And I noticed four of them were all in a straight line. At the time I thought it might be because there's a highway that goes from down south to Sverdlovsk. From Meselson\u2019s unclassified memo for the CIA in 1980 Were you the first person to notice that line pattern? Yes, as far as I know \u2014 except for an admiral at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. He and I both thought that maybe the Russian explanation was plausible, the explanation that the anthrax outbreak was from rotted meat. The textbooks said the incubation time for anthrax was 5-7 days, but we knew that cases were coming in over six weeks, from early April until middle May. That would be inconsistent with an aerosol cloud, because the cloud goes by and then it's gone, but it could be explained by bad meat that sits in the refrigerator. Anyway, I thought that the Soviet explanation was at least plausible. I concluded that the only way to find out is to go there. And I wrote an unclassified memo in April 1980. It gives my impressions, and there's some mathematical calculations on cloud travel, with some graphs that I made to calculate what the dosage would be downwind given various initial release sizes and all that. But I concluded that I had to go there, and the first chance I had was in Geneva. Have you ever heard of the Pugwash Conference ? It was created by Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein. The idea was to have high-level scientists from Russia and the United States meet to try and cool down the nuclear arms race. It's called Pugwash because a rich Canadian railway magnate named Cyrus Eaton had a resort place at Pugwash, Nova Scotia, where it used to meet. I had a cousin named Martin Kaplan, a leader of Pugwash, also the science advisor of the World Health Organization. He introduced me to a Russian who was visiting Geneva for Pugwash, Kiril Dumayev. Dumayev was on something called the Military Industrial Committee in the Soviet Union. That's a high-level committee that decides how much money to spend on major projects, both military and civilian, and he was the chemistry guy. So Martin got us together, and I told Dumayev, \u201cI want to go to Sverdlovsk.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d So I sent him a letter for Moscow, describing exactly where I wanted to go. Now, how did I know where I wanted to go? Dating back to WWII, it was known that the Russians had a military microbiological laboratory in Sverdlovsk. German intelligence knew about it. There was something called \u201cthe Stern Report\u201d in Germany under Hitler, translated in English, a great big thick thing, and it listed everything German intelligence knew about Soviet chemical and biological weapons, much of it quite correct, and it listed this place at Sverdlovsk. I talked with John McMahon , who later became the deputy CIA director. He was all for it. He said, \u201cWe would love you to go there. We'd like to have an American go there.\u201d He gave me a map, because he said, \u201cWhen you're there, they may take you somewhere in Sverdlovsk, and they'll tell you it's this place, and it'll be nothing. It'll be a chocolate factory or something. So I will give you the exact longitude and latitude.\u201d And he gave me directions: you get on the trolley car at the center of town, and you get off at this certain stop, and you walk on this street, and then you turn, etc. It turned out the directions were a little bit wrong. The coordinates were correct, but the street directions would not have got me there. There were a couple of wrong turns. Anyway, I'm all ready to go, and then the Russians shoot down , probably by mistake, a Korean jet, and everybody died. I get a letter from Dumayev, and he says, \u201cIn view of events with this jet, it's not a good time. Unfortunately I cannot invite you.\u201d Then a little bit later, this group called International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War gets the Nobel Peace Prize, and specifically they give the Peace Prize to an American and a Russian. The Russian was their secretary of health, and the American was a cardiologist here in Boston named Bernie Lown , who I knew. In fact, I think he's some distant relative. Then I learned somehow that Bernie was going to go see his friend, the health minister in Moscow, in a few weeks, so I asked Bernie if he would take a message from me to the minister, which was, \u201cCan I go to Sverdlovsk?\u201d A little while later, I get a telex \u2014 we didn't have email yet in those days \u2014 with a guy named Fedorov, the assistant to the minister of health who handles foreign relations, and he says, \u201cI've gone to Sverdlovsk to save you the trouble, and there's nothing there, don't bother, you can't go.\u201d Then I got a call from Sergey Kislyak , who later became the ambassador to the United States, He says, \u201cWe'd like you to come to Moscow to talk with us about Sverdlovsk, we'll fly you there on Aeroflot . You don't need any passports or anything, just come on, we'll take you to Moscow.\u201d So I met a bunch of people who were involved in this, including former minister of health Pyotr Burgasov . It was a great big hotel near the big athletics stadium. And we met at the hospital, which was called the Botkina , a very famous, great big hospital. European hospitals in those days were like villages, for example the Children's Hospital in Paris. There'd be a wall around many buildings. So we met there, and I went to the American Embassy to keep them informed with what was going on. I met with a Soviet general, who told me that the outbreak was caused by bad meat, and I wrote down exactly what they told me, and published it in the Bulletin of the Federation of American Scientists. At the beginning of my article, I said, \u201cThis is what the Russians said to me.\u201d Unfortunately, I should have made it clear that this is not what I believe, necessarily. Maybe it was true, maybe it was not. But a lot of people reading that thought that this was my belief. I had no great belief at the time. I thought maybe they were telling the truth, maybe not. I didn't know. It's still essential to go there. So I come home, and now I'm accused of being a Soviet apologist by a lot of people because I wrote this article. I caught hell from a bunch of people for that. And it's true, I still thought that maybe they were telling the truth. [ Under the Reagan administration, the intelligence community came to a consensus in the early 1980s that the Sverdlovsk anthrax was released from a bioweapons facility. ] Finally, the Soviet Union goes away, and we have Yeltsin and the Russian Federation. I'm in Washington doing some political thing, and I get a call from my secretary at Harvard: \u201cYou have a call from the Soviet embassy in Washington. They want you to greet a member of the Soviet embassy who is a physician, and he's coming from Washington into Logan Airport in Boston. And they wonder, because he doesn't know his way around, if you would meet him at the airport and help him out.\u201d So they gave me his name, and his American Airlines flight and arrival time. They thought I was at Harvard, but actually I'm in Washington. So I decide, \u201cI'll find out if I can meet this guy on the airplane.\u201d I called American Airlines, and I said, \u201cMy partner and I both been doing business in Washington and we become separated, but I know that we're both going back on the same flight. Could you tell me the seat number with Mr. Bourdin? I'd like to sit next to him so we could conduct our business together and save a little time that way. They gave me the seat number, so I get to the airport real early, one of the first passengers there, and I'm sitting in this seat. Pretty soon down the aisle comes a big, heavy guy, and I say nothing. He sits down next to me, I let him get settled, I wait till the plane starts down the runway. And I say in a perfectly calm voice, \u201cVery nice to meet you, Dr. Bourdin.\u201d He was stunned! Of course, I imagine back home that wouldn't be such a big surprise, but I like doing things like that. Then he said, \u201cI have a surprise for you, Dr. Meselson.\u201d His surprise was to tell me that an American physicist is living in Sverdlovsk under a United States/Soviet exchange agreement between the two academies: their RAC and our National Academy of Sciences. He\u2019s a guy named Don Ellis , a solid state physicist, he was there during the epidemic. He's a member of the National Academy, and so am I. So I go down to Washington. Now, normally, trip reports are privileged, but the archivist gives me the trip report . Ellis records that he's there for several weeks, doing solid-state physics with his colleague, a Mr. Gubanov. When he came back to the States, he learned about the anthrax epidemic. He knew nothing about it while he was there, even though he's driving his kids to school every day on weekdays, going right past the police. So I want to go to Sverdlovsk and nothing is working. Sometime in the 1980s, our National Academy of Sciences invited the Soviets to send a delegation, so we could show them that Fort Detrick was no longer doing anything with biological weapons, because in 1969, President Nixon had renounced biological weapons, and there was no bioweapons work going on at Fort Detrick. [ For an account of Meselson\u2019s role in Nixon\u2019s biological weapons ban, see our first interview with him. ] I'm on the welcoming team, and each American was assigned a particular Russian to help them. I was assigned a guy named Alexei Yablokov , Yablokov is a Russian word for apple. This is Mr. Apple. Have you ever been in Baltimore? They bring a big bucket of crabs to your table, and they put down a sheet of brown paper and they dump the crabs. I thought he might like that, and we went to a jazz bar where we couldn't talk because it was too loud. So I got to know this guy. In those days, the CIA published something called FBIS , the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, unclassified translations of things from the Russian radio and press [ the FBIS was dissolved in 2005 ]. There I saw an entry that Mr. Yablokov, my crab jazz friend, had become Yeltsin's Advisor for Environment and Health. So he's like a secretary of the Department of Environment and Health. It said that he had been asked by Yeltsin to look into this anthrax outbreak and figure out what happened. So I sent him a telex saying, \u201cI see that you've been asked by your president to go do this. Could I come and help you?\u201d He said, \u201cYou can come to Sverdlovsk, but only if you're invited.\u201d Bear in mind, this is the former Soviet Union. Everything was loose at this time. Americans were greatly welcomed. People loved Americans. How am I going to get invited? Who do I know in Sverdlovsk? Only one name, this Mr. Gubanov who worked with the American. Now the next thing will absolutely astonish you. I called Don Ellis. There he is in his office. And I say, \u201cI need to get in touch with your colleague, Gubanov. Could you tell me how to reach him?\u201d And Don says, \u201cYes, I'll hand him the telephone. He's sitting right here, he's visiting me.\u201d So Gubanov comes on the phone. I tell him I want to be invited, and he said, \u201cOh, I'm very interested in that outbreak, I'll get you an invitation .\u201d By the way, Gubanov comes back to the United States sometime later, and he ends up as a stockbroker in Florida. Anyway, pretty soon I get a telex from Mr. Suetin , who's the rector of the local university , which is named after Maxime Gorky . In the Middle Ages, universities taught what was called the trivium and the quadrivium . Do you know what I mean? This university in Soviet Russia was teaching the trivium and quadrivium as well as physics and chemistry. But I get this telex from the rector, who says the city is yours, and he assigns to me two guys: a physicist named Borisov, and a younger man who's a physical chemist. So I form a team, including my wife, Jeanne Guillemin , who is a medical anthropologist. And the success of what we did, which proved that it was airborne and not foodborne, was because of her. But if I'm reading this old Washington Post story correctly, Yeltsin was told by the KGB in the early 1980s that the anthrax outbreak was a lab leak. He already knew. That's largely true. Almost completely true. We did not know, because when he acknowledged this, we were on transit. We did not know that he had said it, which of course took some of the wind out of our sails, but we had a scientific proof. In Yeltsin\u2019s book, he says that at the time of the outbreak, he contacted Yuri Andropov , who was the head of the KGB, and he asked him to tell him the cause. At that time, Yeltsin was the Communist Party leader in Sverdlovsk itself. He says he contacted Andropov, but he never heard back from Andropov. Later, after he became president and could get whatever he wanted, he came to the conclusion that it was not bad meat, that it was a military activity. Anyway, we arrive in Sverdlovsk, and we have the names of the pathologist and her assistant, a Jewish man who had done the autopsies, and we knew how to reach them. We called on all these people, but they had nothing that would have really given us proof of a lab leak. But Borisov the physicist was a great help. There was a woman who he knew very well named Larisa Mishustina , who was a member of the Duma. She had been elected to their House of Representatives. She had written a letter to Boris Yeltsin, and she gave me a photocopy: \u201cDear Boris, my constituents would like to know if the anthrax epidemic of 1979 was the result of government activity. If it was, they are entitled to double pension money.\u201d Now, I don't know if any money ever got paid out. But what did happen was she receives a letter from the KGB with, I think, 68 million dollars, and it has a list of constituent names, dates of birth, and their addresses. So my wife Jeanne goes knocking on those doors. She goes straight down the list. We were there twice, 1990 and 1991, and then Jeanne goes back a third time to complete these interviews. Jeanne would go to each of these little houses, knock on the door: \u201cWe are from the university,\u201d which is true. \u201cWe are studying health,\u201d that's true. \u201cWe understand that you lost a husband or a child or a wife during the anthrax outbreak. May we talk with you?\u201d In every case but one, Jeanne told me they were invited in. And the one was an elderly lady who had just come out of the bath and said she wasn't dressed. In all the other cases, they were invited in. Jeanne Guillamin and a Russian researcher with a Sverdlovsk family Meselson and Guillamin (second and third from right) with their Russian hosts And Jeanne had a questionnaire, which I had written, but which she refined \u2014 now remember, she's an anthropologist, she knows how to do this \u2014 and she asked a whole bunch of questions. But the question that we were most interested in is, \u201cWhere did they work,\u201d or were they pensioners who stayed home? So we could plot a map. In those days, you could buy a nice satellite map of Sverdlovsk from Spot Satellite , a high-res map showing individual houses, a high-resolution map, and I could plot each of these locations on my computer. After Jeanne left, two professors in Sverdlovsk kept on doing the interviews, and data kept dribbling in. Little by little, it became more like a picture that's appearing when you develop a film. You could see more and more of these locations were in a narrow zone that goes from the military facility down toward the southwest, outside the city, to the villages where the sheep and cows had died. There were two exceptions, but they were the deaths of two men who were truck drivers. So they could have been driving through that band at the time of the lab leak. The deaths all followed this line, every one of them. The most distant was 50 kilometers. Also, the World Meteorological Organization has headquarters in Geneva, and many countries belong to it, including the Soviet Union, and every three hours, from all the major airports, they're supposed to report wind direction, wind speed cloud cover, humidity, and so on. All that data is there in Geneva. If you want it, you can buy it. It's expensive, but there was a guy there who was a graduate student and we made pals over the phone. So he sent me this data, I didn't have to pay for it. And it turns out there's one day and one day only when the wind is in exactly that direction all day long. That's clearly what happened. No question. Our paper is a classic in epidemiology, quite aside from the subject. I guess I'm bragging, but what could be more clear-cut? It's a beautiful image. They're beautiful images. I'm very proud. And the credit really goes to my wife, who died in 2019. Now, let's talk about what happened later. Yeah. It\u2019s a re"

    "keywords": "Inside the San Francisco group house scene. Inside the San Francisco group house scene. Inside the San Francisco group house scene. In 1968, fresh off the Summer of Love, Joan Didion\u2019s \u201c Slouching Towards Bethlehem \u201d introduced Americans to new forms of group living that were beginning to take place in the Bay Area. The essay\u2019s most famous vignette was of a preschool-aged child given LSD by her parents. It closed with the indelible image of a single mother trying to stop her three-year-old from burning down the house, while her roommates retrieved \u201csome very good Moroccan hash which had dropped down through a floorboard damaged in the fire.\u201d It left the overwhelming impression that San Francisco was a city of children raised by children. Today the Bay Area is once again an epicenter of co-living. As in the communes of the \u201960s, some co-living leaders advocate for new forms of kinship and communal parenting. But in interviews with more than a dozen residents and leaders of co-living communities, we found a very different culture than that of the hippies portrayed by Didion or Tom Wolfe. The Bay Area\u2019s sky-high rents, and its existing stock of old Victorian mansions, with their roomy common spaces and abundant bedrooms, naturally incentivize group living. There are ornate Victorian mansions converted into 20-person co-ops complete with chore schedules and manifestos, intergenerational houses crammed with bunk beds and school books, and luxurious hotels turned founder residencies aimed at incubating the next generation of startup unicorns. Between them are vast philosophical differences. Are these houses for building long-term community, or for meeting a constant cycle of interesting new people? Is the co-living scene \u201ctech-adjacent\u201d or a stark rejection of the mainstream tech ethos? Are the benefits of group living \u2014 saving money, emotional support structures, professional networking \u2014 to be shared among the residents or directed toward social issues? Are these houses attempts to escape capitalism or to hyperoptimize life for a new capitalist class? Despite this variance, many of these houses \u2014 like the 50 tracked in a shared spreadsheet \u2014 see themselves as pursuing the same cultural project. Unlike those of the flower children, these group houses are more consciously focused on balance: marrying professional success and holistic wellness. The leaders of these group houses believe that our modern environment is hostile to cultivating community, and that the single-family home is an artificially narrow ideal. And although the scale and language of their ambitions vary, they all see co-living projects as catalysts for broader shifts in how society is organized. As one group house participant describes in an essay , \u201cGroup houses function as \u2018planets\u2019 \u2014 each has a cultural gravity that selects for a unique orbital community.\u201d Increasingly, the denizens of those planets are thinking about building alliances throughout their solar system. The 2010s saw a massive influx of startup founders to San Francisco, many of whom were remarkably young, recent college graduates or dropouts. They didn\u2019t want to live alone, or couldn\u2019t afford to, or their parents didn\u2019t want them to. Low interest rates made taking a risk on a startup suddenly attractive, and institutions like the Thiel Fellowship and Y Combinator encouraged the ecosystem. Startups felt exciting and novel, and the class of people building them felt a kinship to each other: they were ambitious, driven, and saw their jobs as a way of life. \u201cEverything used to sincerely and unironically exist in/with companies: you wore their swag, you attended their parties, etc.,\u201d says one founder and investor. In efforts to attract and retain talent, Big Tech companies invested in amenities and perks for employees, and the line between work and the rest of life blurred further. Meals, nap pods, and pingpong at the office became de rigueur in much of the industry. According to one estimate , in 2015 the ridership of the tech shuttles that ferried employees to their offices was more than a third of San Francisco\u2019s public transit ridership. The frothy startup feeling paralleled an idea making its way out of Burning Man. A huge event held every August in Black Rock Desert in Nevada, it draws over 80,000 people to camp out and erect (and dismantle) a whole city in just two weeks. Returning from experiences of radical love and connection, attendees wondered why they couldn\u2019t architect the ideal living situation in their daily lives. The mission was simple: bring Burning Man back to the city. Today, many Bay Area houses have strong Burning Man influences in both the language and values written in their charters. Some documents pull directly from Burning Man\u2019s 10 Principles, espousing the values of \u201cparticipation\u201d and \u201ccommunal effort\u201d by encouraging residents to engage in communal living experiments and a system of \u201cdo-ocracy,\u201d in which residents should take action themselves if they want something changed. Many of those \u201cbest practices\u201d are indistinguishable from the conventions of startups. Group houses use office productivity tools like Slack and Google Workspace to manage their communities, or extensive Discord chats that require daily checking, with channels segmenting general house chatter, cleaning, social events, party planning, and memes. Some houses have required meetings, complete with minutes, and open-source manifestos hosted on GitHub describing the house\u2019s mission and procedures. Others maintain a complex chore quota system, complete with points and leaderboards. Extensive documentation on conflict resolution, consensus-making, rent models, and recruiting is circulated online . In this new world, group houses are engineered to be productive in one way or another, either by providing a better quality of living for its residents or by allowing people to experience compounding effects on their professional and social lives. As researcher and technologist Toby Shorin describes it, \u201cThe density of networks and intergenerational capital flows is what drives SF. Group houses play a pretty key role in the social capital formation that enables it all.\u201d Some see their communal living projects as part of a larger and bolder project. Thomas Schulz the founder of Solaris , a campus in Hayes Valley designed \u201cto help ambitious people find and build their life\u2019s work\u201d \u2014 specifically within AI. In 2023, the neighborhood took on a new moniker, Cerebral Valley, to describe the multitude of artificial intelligence startups being founded there. Schulz insists, \u201cIn the scope of history, people will look back on what\u2019s happening in Hayes Valley and be like, \u2018This was the first example of people living in an environment together that was very much oriented around self-actualization.\u2019\u201d Neall Seth, another Solaris member, describes the promise of founder-oriented houses as bringing to home life what startups brought to the workplace: \u201cbundles of services that reduce overhead associated with lifestyle needs,\u201d or as Seth calls it, \u201clifestyle infrastructure.\u201d Solaris is one of a set of co-living projects explicitly designed for founders. Until recently, like several other houses or networks of houses, it listed the founders who live in one of its seven neighboring apartments. It also highlighted amenities, including \u201ca meal prep service for high performance\u201d and \u201ca hackathon to accelerate progress in SF,\u201d as well as a directory to find potential housemates. Bundling is a core premise of the group house; buying bulk resources is cheaper and more efficient for everyone involved, and the mental load of maintaining a property and planning social events is theoretically lessened when shared among a group of people. Founder-targeted houses take this further by providing things like access to food, cleaning services, office and lab space, even compute power for training large language models, under the assumption that the mundane aspects of daily living only serve to take away from work. Schulz says his houses are a good fit for people who are \u201cvery, very, very, focused and basically want to set their life up in a way where the only thing that they\u2019re thinking about and focusing on is moving the needle forward on whatever it is that they\u2019re doing and being in an environment of people that are trying to accumulate resources and work together to get something done.\u201d He\u2019s not the only one with a grand vision of the San Francisco future. The website of AGI House, arguably Silicon Valley\u2019s most well-known hacker house , which has attracted the likes of Sergey Brin to its weekly hackathons, reads , \u201cWelcome to a new golden age.\u201d Just north of Cerebral Valley sits the Archbishop's Mansion, built in 1904 for Patrick William Riordan, the second archbishop of San Francisco. When the official residence moved, the building became a reform school for Catholic boys, then later a psychiatric clinic, and finally, a bed-and-breakfast. Today, it hosts the startup accelerator Hacker Fellowship Zero, or HF0 . --> 1 --> HF0 co-founder Dave Fontenot is similarly committed to paring away the distractions of quotidian life for startup founders; he describes HF0, which offers three-month residencies for founders, as a \u201c monastery of code .\u201d An older model of the \u201chacker house\u201d was popularized less than a decade ago by Silicon Valley and The Social Network: one of dire bachelor pads, complete with desks stood up by cases of Diet Coke . When Schulz first arrived in San Francisco in 2019, he stayed in The Crypto Castle. \u201cThere were rooms with four bunk beds in them,\u201d says Schulz. In 2016, Fontenot lived in Mission Control, a house described by Nellie Bowles: \u201cResidents, who pay between $950 and $1,450 and range in age from 18 to 23, keep their mattresses on the floor with plain white sheets tangled at the feet.\u201d At the time, Fontenot\u2019s possessions fit in his backpack. Today, Fontenot and others who came out of an earlier era of hacker houses are creating a more luxe, programmed version of that experience. The perks in many of these houses run less toward the \u201cpingpong and beanbags,\u201d Big Tech office end and more toward relentless optimization. HF0 covers the costs of freezing eggs for female founders. Another house, Longevity Castle, promises infrared saunas, luxury suites, and intimate dinner series. The 20-year-old founder of The Residency, another group house/residency combination, highlights notable features of his house: red lights after 10 p.m., a meditation area, and \u201ca crap load of whiteboards.\u201d While monks in the HF0 monastery tend to be working on AI, just a few years ago, many of them were building crypto projects . Although the house currently runs three-month-long programs, Fontenot has grander dreams. \u201cHow do we create an institution that just takes care of the most creative people in the world, that takes care of the builders and just allows them to build?\u201d Much of the promotional language for these houses is similar. Fontenot, like Schulz, refers to co-living houses as places where founders can birth \u201ctheir life\u2019s work.\u201d Schulz blogs that, \u201cwith the advancements in AI, we can solve the problem [of human disconnectedness] via connected communities aligned with capitalism.\u201d Hacker houses may command more attention at the moment, but the vestiges of the \u201960s push toward more radical, communal living arrangements still exist. Zarinah Agnew is a long-time stalwart of the Bay Area group house scene. Agnew is the founder (they prefer \u201csteward\u201d) of Haight St. Commons , a collective of more than two dozen intentional communities in San Francisco, Berkeley, and Oakland. Members regularly host interhouse mixers, write primers for starting intentional communities, and use a Google Form that acts as a \u201cCommon Application\u201d to apply to live at any group house in the collective. Haight St. Commons has also had a hand in creating two intentional communities in the network with special missions: Treehouse and Template are respectively for people co-parenting foster kids and for the formerly incarcerated. \u201cLiving in community,\u201d Agnew tells me, \u201cyou garner a lot of surplus. Buying groceries for one person is way more inefficient than 12x for 12 people, for example. You get this surplus of space, and then you also have a surplus of sociality. And then the question becomes, what do you want to do with your surplus?\u201d The \u201csurplus\u201d can come at a cost. \u201cThere are so many sides of me and this house doesn't capture all of them. It takes up a lot of my time and energy in ways that doesn\u2019t leave necessarily a lot of room for the other ones,\u201d says Winter Ku, one of the founders and current residents of Treehouse, which is currently home to six adults and three children. --> 2 --> Ku sometimes shares a room (other housemates have at times slept three to a room). They also cover less financially stable housemates\u2019 rent. Ku describes these decisions as efforts to support the house\u2019s \u201canti-capitalist\u201d approach. Lots of time in Ku\u2019s house is spent on conflict resolution, especially regarding co-parenting and how their actions affect the kids. Conflicts can be time-consuming and emotionally challenging, but Ku suggests they can also be \u201cgenerative\u201d; in other words, conflict, and the commitment to get past it, is an integral part of bonding the group together. In a co-living wiki, Agnew provides resources for \u201cgenerative conflict.\u201d Agnew cites anthropologist David Graeber\u2019s ideas about small-c communism. \u201cThe home, whether the family or otherwise, is a moment of everyday communism.\u201d For Agnew, group houses are a way to expand the traditional circle of \u201cfamily\u201d to include people from vastly different backgrounds. The processes of sharing food and knowledge, pooling resources, and conflict resolution baked into your everyday life with a tight-knit group of people have benefits that are hard to see until it all comes together. When asked about the tension between that vision, and the hypercapitalist, founder-focused version of group living, Agnew chooses their words carefully: \u201cYes, it is a tension. And I think it's an interesting one.\u201d Phil Levin is a co-founder of several group houses, including RGB , a Victorian mansion in Hayes Valley, and Radish , a six-building Oakland compound \u201cfor people who believe in the \u2018Obvious Truth\u2019 \u2014 that we are happiest and healthiest surrounded by people we love and admire.\u201d When creating a group house, he explains, \u201cYou're always taking real estate that was not built for this and trying to adapt it.\u201d Levin is both a friend and collaborator of Agnew\u2019s. Unlike Agnew, he\u2019s in favor of free markets \u2014 and has founded multiple companies trying to make co-living more accessible. His project Live Near Friends, a housing search platform that\u2019s \u201cmultiplayer instead of single player,\u201d makes it easier for groups to buy and rent housing together. Levin has seen several companies built around co-living rise and fall. \u201cNo one wants to be a pa"

    "keywords": "In 1969, President Nixon announced the end of all American offensive biological weapons programs, and renounced the first use of chemical weapons. But it wasn\u2019t until several months later that Nixon confirmed that the U.S. would end all military research into toxins, which can be created either in nature or in the lab. Nixon chose to end that toxin research because of one man, our interviewee today. Matthew Meselson is well-known in biology for his Meselson-Stahl experiment , which demonstrated that DNA replicates semiconservatively, and has won myriad awards for his academic work. But his consulting work for federal agencies at several crucial moments in Cold War history may be Meselson\u2019s greatest professional contribution. Meselson is 94 years old. He graciously agreed to a conversation with Statecraft about one of those moments. The first part of our conversation is published below. How do you convince a president in one memo? How did Hungarian lunch ladies help lead to Nixon banning toxins for military use? Why did the Joint Chiefs of Staff want to develop anthrax? Why was Nixon reading Michael Crichton? The interviewee as a young man. Subscribe Print version I got into this whole subject purely by accident. My friend Paul Doty , a Harvard chemist, was on the General Advisory Committee of the newly created United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency . John F. Kennedy had created it. It's something that Hubert Humphrey had wanted. It was the summer of 1963, and I had nothing to do \u2014 my lab was working well, it didn't need me. I wasn't married. I have a friend who had a beautiful house in Georgetown, walking distance from the State Department. With this lovely house, the idea of summer, maybe I'd meet a nice lady. So Doty nominates me, and they pay a nice salary and travel expenses so you could go back and forth on weekends. And they hired six of us academics. I got down there and they're all very friendly. It was a bit like a college rather than a government agency because they were looking for ideas: they were newly created and they didn't know exactly what they should do. They had money from the Bureau of the Budget [ now OMB ]. I was told I should work on \u201carms control of theater nuclear weapons in Europe.\u201d I knew absolutely nothing about this subject. Because Doty nominated me and was on the general advisory board. I suppose that's why. Maybe they did a little bit of a background check and discovered I'd never done anything too terrible. Who knows? So they said I should work on arms control of nuclear weapons, about which I knew zero. I went to my boss, Franklin Long , a very fine chemist from Cornell, and said, \u201cI don't know anything about this. I'm a chemist and a biologist. Why don't you have me look at that?\u201d He said, \u201cYou can do whatever you want. We're all going off to Moscow to negotiate the atmospheric test ban , and we had a guy, just like you, he had got a degree from Caltech, but he got depressed and he killed himself. You can have all of the documents that he collected, you can have his safe.\u201d So I looked in his safe, I read all his documents, and I went to the CIA to see what we knew about what other countries were doing. At that time the answer was, we have suspicions, but very little hard knowledge. And then I went to Fort Detrick to see what we were doing. Top Secret and Q for nuclear weapons. They gave me Q because they thought maybe I would work on European theater nuclear weapons There are all kinds of security clearances beyond top secret. Anyway, I went to Fort Detrick, and a colonel who had been an assistant professor at the Harvard Medical School gave me a nice tour. He took me all around, and we came to a building about seven stories high. When we got up close, I could see what looked like windows were just fake windows. I asked him, \u201cWhat do we do in there?\u201d He said, \u201cWe make anthrax spores. We have a 10,000-gallon reactor. I said, \u201cWhy do we do that?\u201d He said they'd be cheaper than nuclear weapons as a strategic weapon. It didn't take me very long to realize that one thing the United States definitely did not want is the introduction into the world of a super cheap strategic weapon. It's our interest to keep strategic weapons so expensive that nobody could afford them but us. That would be the best. The next best would be only our pals. But the idea that you could introduce a strategic weapon that anybody could have? What if you could make hydrogen bombs for a dollar a piece? Oh my God! So I realized that I had a perfect, irrefutable argument to get rid of this crap. All that I'd have to do is get to the person who could stop it. Who's that? It was only one person, that's President Johnson. This is still 1963. Kennedy had been assassinated in November. I wrote some papers inside the arms control agency, suggesting that the agency become interested in this. And William Foster , who was the director of the agency, a very fine Republican, thought that it should be done by the President's national security team, which was then under the direction of McGeorge Bundy , who was the dean who\u2019d hired me at Harvard and by then already a pal. So Mr. Foster wrote to Bundy and said, \u201cWhy don't you look into this?\u201d And Bundy wrote back and said, \u201cWe're awfully busy right now. No, you do it.\u201d That meant that I had the blessing of Foster. So I wrote a paper. What else did I do? I went around and talked to a lot of people. And nothing much happened until a little bit later. No interagency group was tasked with thinking about the problem. All you had was Meselson and a few pals here and there who thought it was interesting. This was a slumbering topic. The big topic at that time was a plan that came out of the State Department. to put nuclear weapons on ships. There was great fear that Germany might want to make their own nuclear weapons. And if that was true, we'd have a lot of problems, so we wanted to keep nuclear weapons under our unified control. The idea was called a multilateral force: you put nuclear weapons on ships and you'd have representatives of Germany and France, at least. With the agreement of them and the United States, they could fire the nuclear weapons, but it would give them a kind of finger on the trigger, a terrible idea. And my friend Henry Kissinger thought it was an absolutely terrible idea. He thought anything that spread the capability of firing nuclear weapons beyond the United States \u2014 and we can't help about the Soviet Union \u2014 was a dumb idea. We don't want to make it multilateral. But then the German minister of defense asked for release authority on the chemical weapons that we had stored in Germany. Those weapons had originally been placed in France, but General de Gaulle did not want them in France, and he ordered them out. They belonged to us, so we moved them out of France into Germany. He didn't want any American weapons that he couldn't control. De Gaulle was not very hot on anything that wasn't under French control. So they get moved to Germany, and they're still under our complete control. The Germans provided real estate where we could keep them, but they didn\u2019t have release authority. So the Germans say they would like to be able to use those weapons. That gets a lot of interest in Washington. First of all, it's a very important question. Do we want them, in the middle of a war with Russia, unilaterally, to start using chemical weapons? Hell no! Second, chemical weapons in German hands? There are still a lot of memories of Auschwitz and things like that. It would not send a very good message. There were mainly artillery shells with nerve gas, and there may have been some mustard gas, I\u2019m not sure. Now that's a big deal that requires consideration at the highest level of the United States government, which is called the Committee of Principals , which means the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and so on. I don't know if the newspapers knew about it. But the point I want to make most strongly is that this topic of chemical weapons went from a question at the lowest possible level, a nobody summer consultant named Meselson and a few of his pals, right up to the Committee of Principals in one big jump. So that's really what got a lot of interest going, and why a lot of people read the papers I was writing. But more important than any of this \u2014 you can't really be sure why things happen in the world \u2014 but it was because Henry [ Kissinger ] and I were already good friends. And that was for a silly reason. His building, which was called the Semitic Museum there [ now the Harvard Museum of the Ancient Near East ], is full of things from the Middle East, from ancient Mesopotamia, Sumer, and Babylonia. During the war, the Air Force took it over for offices. Henry still had an office there, and it was right next to the biological laboratory, which is me. On the third floor, there was a kitchen where two Hungarian ladies made the most magnificent lunches: goulash and all kinds of stuff. I would have lunch there, and so would Henry, and I got to meet him that way. Also beginning in 1966, Henry created a Harvard/MIT arms control seminar , which met in the evenings once a month, and I was a member of that, and then I got to know him really well. I was going through a divorce from my first wife, as was Henry, and we used to sit together in his office and complain about how cold Harvard was. And then also, we were in Europe at a so-called Pugwash meeting, and I had a car, and he had no car, so I drove him around. Then Nixon gets elected to the presidency. And before Nixon takes office, he already named his cabinet and Henry as his national security advisor. I'm going to Washington back and forth quite often in those days. See, I was from Harvard, Jack Kennedy was from Harvard, Washington was full of people who'd been appointed by Kennedy. I could knock on doors. \u201cOkay, you're a professor from Harvard, come on in.\u201d I got to see Elliot Richardson and all kinds of people. So I'm doing all that stuff when Henry is named National Security Advisor. And the airport in Boston at American Airlines, there's a ramp. I'm walking up the ramp and Henry's walking down, and we collide. Bingo. Like that. He knows I'm interested in chemical and biological weapons, and he says, \u201cWhat should I do about your thing?\u201d I said, \u201cI'll write you some papers.\u201d Yes. So the first thing I did, I gave him a copy of Michael Crichton. Do you know who Michael Crichton was? Yeah. Lots of books. He was a Harvard medical student, but he didn't practice medicine. He had written a book called The Andromeda Strain , about this horrible organism that comes back from some planet and so on, and Henry gave it to the president. I never met the president, but Henry told me it made a big impression on the president, got him interested in biological weapons. When he read it, I don't know. Maybe he read it in the bathroom. But anyway, I wrote a paper for Henry, and I had a winning argument. There's no way you could argue against it. The question was, how do you get the president to pay attention to it? In biology, before you do an experiment, usually you write what's called a protocol. You list what reagents you need, what equipment you need, and then one, two, three, the steps. Since that was my habit, I got a yellow pad of paper and I wrote a protocol. What do you do to get the president? Go see him: but I had no way to do that. I wrote down: maintain close contact with Henry. Then there's the Congress. How do you affect the Congress? My first approach was thinking not many Congressmen were going to want to talk to me. Senator Ed Brook was from Massachusetts, okay, I could talk to him. But the easy thing to do would be to talk to the young people in their offices. Senators and congressmen usually have two kinds of assistants, an administrative assistant who keeps the wheels turning, and a legislative assistant who helps write legislation and speeches. [ These days, congressmen generally have 8-9 office team members. Senators have more. ] Generally, these are young people, and they were easy to see, because they're always looking for something for their boss. And I got to know several of them, and then I got to know Senator Fulbright : that was really important. William Fulbright was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, a rural scholar, a professor of history. I got to know him for a funny reason. Reagan had just proposed the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) . And Fulbright thought it was a lousy idea. But he had the crazy idea that, even if ABM would prevent nuclear weapons from reaching the United States, the Russians could still attack us somehow with biological weapons, and therefore it's not very important to have ABM, because we\u2019d still be vulnerable. He said, \u201cI want you to give a talk to the entire committee on a classified basis.\u201d So I come down to Washington and they clear a room for top secret discussion. I gave this long thing, and it was published, but I had to sanitize it, because I had a lot of classified stuff in there. [ Here Meselson tells a story that cannot be repeated. ] So I went to Washington again and again. I wrote papers for Henry. The argument was unbeatable, and now comes a time for treaties. The British already had a draft biological weapons treaty that had been sitting in a file. So the British proposed it, and that meant that we had to think about it, too, and it meant that the Soviets would be talking about it: we\u2019d have to answer. By this time, we had a marvelous guy at the arms control agency, an artillery captain named Don Manley. He and others at the agency began to work out U.S. policy. We agreed with the British. At the same time, there was work going on the Chemical Weapons Convention , which had a verification annex, with real inspection. Russian guys could come and watch us destroy our chemical weapons. The chemical industry was very supportive of the Chemical Weapons Convention, quite different from their point of view back in the 1920s. After Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring , chemistry had become a bad word. The chemical industry thought it would be very nice if they could be portrayed as against chemical weapons, and both Monsanto and DuPont let two of our guys leave their regular duties just to help the negotiation. Of course, they were also interested in making sure that the eventual treaty had nothing that would really harm the industry. But these guys were very helpful in designing verification procedures. What do you do when you come to a chemical manufacturer's facility to show that it's not making chemical weapons? Do you allow them to take samples? What kind of samples? Do you allow them to look at everything? What kind of information do you give them? These details are all in the treaty, but those details were partly worked out with help, because what do the diplomats know about chemistry? Now, what about the Biological Weapons Convention ? There were a lot of ideas about it, and many meetings at the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva on a verification protocol for the Biological Weapons Convention. I was part of the U.S. delegation at one of those meetings to try to negotiate verification protocol. It never happened. The reason was that the manufacturers\u2019 association for pharmaceuticals, PhRMA , is now a mature organization, but at that time, they were not close to the industry. They were a brand new outfit, and they simply assumed that it would be bad for the pharmaceutical industry to have any kind of visit at the factories where they make drugs. They never visited a single CEO, as far as I know. How do I know that? I was on a very secret committee in the State Department some years later, and I wanted to tell this committee what the pharmaceutical industry thought about verification. Merck\u2019s CEO was a biochemist named Roy Vagelos , and I knew him. He's at Martha's Vineyard for the summer, and I go out there and we have lunch at the Black Dog Cafe, and he says, \u201cWe would welcome verification!\u201d I asked him, \u201cDid PhRMA ever contact you? \u201cNo, I\u2019d never heard of pharma in those days, what is going on?\u201d He said, \u201cWe invite the public to our manufacturing facilities. You have to understand something about secrecy in the pharmaceutical business,\u201d he said. In the chemical business, let's say you make a big ticket item like phosgene, thousands of tons of phosgene. It costs a certain number of dollars per ton. If your competitor could shave even a few pennies off that, they'd get the business. You don't want them to know how you make it for the price you make it. But now look at pharmaceuticals. The production of a drug ain't got nothing to do with the price of the drug. \u201cThe first thing is all the research and development,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next thing is clinical trials. We have to pay for those trials. Costs a fortune. Then we have to get it accepted by doctors because they're the ones who are going to prescribe it. That requires all kinds of publicity, packaging, and so on.\u201d \u201cIf some guy comes to where we make Lipitor , and they see the temperature in which we carry out a certain reaction, and they go copy it, we'll take them to court. We will destroy them because we can buy any number of lawyers.\u201d Now, if it's the Chinese, they don't respect patent law, at least in those days. \u201cBut by and large, there are no secrets in the places where we make stuff. Now, we're not going to let anybody inspect our research and development laboratories and ask to see our new books, because very often we don't even try to ask for a patent while we're still trying to figure out how to make it.\u201d But it was too late. I had lunch with Roy after the United States had already pulled out of the negotiations. So they collapsed. Toxins are poisonous things that a good chemist could synthesize in a lab, but they're made by living things, by a snake or spider or bacterium. The question is, are toxins chemical or biological weapons? The British wanted to retain toxins, and because there was only a biological weapons treaty at that time, the British wanted to call toxins chemical weapons, so that if they were made by chemists they would not be prohibited in the Biological Weapons Convention. In the United States, we had to decide what we would consider them to be. If they're biologicals, they're prohibited right away, because the biological weapons conventions came first. If they're chemical, the ultimate decision of what these things are, of course, is going to be made by the president. The Joint Chiefs of Staff wrote a paper: they wanted to call them chemical weapons, so that if they're made by chemists, it's okay for the army to have toxic weapons. In general, the joint chiefs don't want to set a precedent of giving up on anything. If you wanted to prohibit fly swatters, probably it's a bad precedent. Anyway, the State Department said, \u201cLet's call them biological weapons, because it looks bad for the United States to seem to want to kill people with toxins.\u201d I wrote a paper for Henry called \u201c What Policy for Toxins ,\u201d and he read it . I know that because the copy that was given to him is all marked up by his assistant. One night, the president, Kissinger, and other officials go down to Key Biscayne, which was a resting place for President Nixon. They're down there and they're going to make a decision. Henry had written a paper advocating the middle position , that toxins should be prohibited if they're made by bugs, but permitted if made by chemists. Now of course, if a toxin is used on the battlefield, it's going to be hard to tell who made it. I never asked him, but I could only guess that he didn't want to have to fight with Mel Laird [ Nixon\u2019s Secretary of Defense ] because he needed Mel Laird on a lot of other issues. Laird's position was that if they're made by chemists, they can be used. The Joint Chiefs\u2019 position was that no matter who makes them, it's okay f"

    "keywords": "Today's interviewee, Professor Chris Snyder , is a Non-Resident Senior Fellow at the Institute for Progress (IFP). He teaches economics at Dartmouth College, where he specializes in industrial organization and microeconomic theory. He is also a research associate at the NBER , treasurer of the Industrial Organization Society , and a faculty director for the University of Chicago's Market Shaping Accelerator . Chris played a pivotal role in the advance market commitment , or \u201cAMC,\u201d for the pneumococcal vaccine, which saved close to a million lives. What you\u2019ll learn: How did the U.S. and Russia end up in the same funding coalition? Why didn\u2019t we design an AMC for malaria? How do you place a market value on future innovations? Why would cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s be poor candidates for an AMC? Let\u2019s say funders want to encourage more innovation, and they\u2019re worried that the private market might not provide the right incentives. Some sweetening of the pot is needed, and push and pull are different ways to do that. Innovation in pharmaceuticals, from idea to clinical trials to eventual product, could be a 5, 10, 20-year process. Push funding comes at the beginning of that pipeline: the funder picks promising innovators and provides grant funding for them. It's basically payment for attempts to get these innovations. Pull funding dangles a reward at the other end of the pipeline. It provides incentives, potentially to parties unknown to the funders, to move along the pipeline in order to receive that reward. So pull funding is a promise of a payment for success. It could be the reward for an idea, like the famous longitude competition , or it could be a reward for the development of a practical product. The commercial market is the most familiar form of pull funding. If you develop an electric vehicle battery that has a much higher range and doesn't use a lot of rare earths, there'll be a huge market for that. But in some cases, commercial incentives may not actually match enormous social needs. There's a role for governments, organizations, and philanthropists to come in and try to shape those markets. Push funding is the default way to fund innovation \u2014 the NSF, NIH, and other agencies have used it for decades. Pull funding is less common and maybe needs a little bit of boosterism. At the Market Shaping Accelerator , we encourage people to consider pull funding because it has stronger incentives. For ideas that might not have a serious market, it can get contenders working hard to push the product to market as quickly as possible. I think part of the reason is that it's hard to imagine paying for something that doesn't exist. Governments are used to signing a purchase contract for an existing product. How in the world do you even design this pie-in-the-sky product that might not exist for 10 years, and somehow get it to market? As you say, it's one of a variety of possible pull funding mechanisms. It's basically a bundle of features, some defining and some ancillary. The defining features are implied in the name. A funder promises to either purchase a product that is not yet developed, or to add a subsidy on top of other consumers\u2019 purchases. The novelty is that it's the promise of payment for an innovation that doesn't yet exist. It might be a vaccine for a neglected tropical disease, or it might be a method for permanent atmospheric carbon removal at a moderate price. So the promise might be 5, 10 years in advance of when the product will arrive. The implied reward is not a lump sum, but is tied to the amount of the good that's distributed. And it's for a practical product that will be rolled out widely. It's not as simple as an advance purchase contract \u2014 we haven\u2019t identified all of the producers to sign a purchase contract with. It\u2019s firm-agnostic, in that you say, \u201cWe\u2019ll purchase from any firm that comes along and produces a good that meets the technical product profile.\u201d It could even be technology-agnostic: we specify that it has to solve these problems, and we\u2019ll fund any technology that does the trick. The \u201ccommitment\u201d piece is that the products may have limited commercial potential. It could be that consumers are in poor countries, and purchases are made on their behalf by donors. There might be climate externalities or epidemiological externalities, so the consumers aren't internalizing the full social benefit of their consumption. When the market eventually materializes, it might not be that lucrative. That's the whole reason for the market shaping mechanism: we specify in advance that there will be a subsidy or a more lucrative price than you might expect. That gives firms some confidence that investments in R&D and capacity will get compensated. I think the idea was floating around in development economics circles back in the \u201880s and \u201890s. It really crystallized with the work of Michael Kremer , who eventually won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on using randomized control trials (RCTs). He later worked on another paper with Rachel Glennerster and Heidi Williams , the Director of Science Policy at IFP. Michael and Rachel also published a book called Strong Medicine , which talks about AMCs in general and why vaccines for neglected tropical diseases are a really good use case. Malaria was the main use case people had in mind at that time. So that was the intellectual genesis of the idea, which then caught fire and moved from theory, idea, and policy to implementation. I think Michael Kremer, Rachel Glennerster, Ruth Levine , their co-author, and Nancy Birdsall at the Center for Global Development are persuasive people. Michael was the Gates Professor at Harvard University. That was a connection to the Gates Foundation , which was gaining a big head of steam. They have an innovative approach where they say, \u201cLet's hire the best people and pay them a pretty good salary to pursue the best ideas that will do the most social good.\u201d I wouldn't say CEO salaries or CFO salaries, but getting that quality of person. So I think they persuaded the Gates Foundation. There were also some finance ministers who Michael and Rachel had a connection to who wanted to get on board. These were farsighted people in the finance ministries of various countries \u2014 Owen Barder in the UK is a PhD economist \u2014 who said, \u201cThis is a winning idea that could save a lot of lives. Let's work on piloting it.\u201d The best candidate might not be an ideal pilot case. Malaria was very scientifically difficult: it has the insect factor, and it's not a virus, so it's gonna be really hard to deal with. Suppose that the advance market commitment was successful and generated 10 times more investment than has ever been seen in that space, increasing the chance of successful product development from 10% to 20%. Even if it's successful in spurring all this investment, 80% of the time, you're still not gonna end up with a product; it'll look like a loss and be hard to measure. So I think the idea was to have a near-term product that had a higher probability of success. And that's why they moved to pneumococcal disease. Malaria was responsible for far more death and illness, but pneumococcal disease was still a worthy target. It was responsible for the deaths of up to a million children under five each year. In high-income countries, it's less of a killer because we can get timely antibiotics. In poorer countries where timely antibiotics are not as widely available, it has a higher mortality rate. There were already first-generation vaccines against pneumococcal, so the AMC was for a second-generation vaccine. That\u2019s not as hard of a scientific problem. It was more about, \u201cCan we complete the R&D that we need for the late-stage clinical trials? Can we scale up capacity to support a fairly broad, almost universal campaign for low-income countries?\u201d There are scores of different strains of pneumococcal disease. The first-generation vaccine was marketed and distributed in high-income countries, and it targeted seven strains that were more prevalent there. That vaccine, Prevnar , was developed by Wyeth , which was later purchased by Pfizer . There was already work underway on a second-generation vaccine that integrated the remaining 10% of strains found in high-income countries. That marginal improvement was actually worth rationalizing the R&D. And so the thought was, \u201cCould we piggyback off of this and get the capacity scaled up? Because this second-generation vaccine that will conjugate 13 different strains would be a lot more effective in low-income countries.\u201d That was through my history of working with Michael Kremer. We noticed that pharmaceutical markets, and in particular vaccine markets, are just really unusual. It\u2019s funny, but you can think of economics as the science of telling people that what they think is unusual about their markets is actually not. Vaccines do have some special features, though, so we spent some time just thinking about the microeconomic theory. That resulted in a theory paper about vaccines. When they decided to pilot this advance market commitment idea, which, in a sense, was Michael\u2019s brainchild, he was part of the economic expert group to validate the program design. He brought me along because I was his co-conspirator in this theory and I had worked on vaccines; maybe I was there to do some proofs and think deeply about microeconomic theory. There was also Jonathan Levin , who was just named the president of Stanford. We were the theorists. We also had some economists who specialized in pharmaceutical markets, Ernie Berndt and Patricia Danzon . And then there were doctors from developing countries, industry officials, and scientists who knew about pneumococcal disease and vaccines. That was coordinated by Gavi . Andrew Jones was the head of the pneumococcal AMC part of their work. That happened before I was brought on to the economic expert group, but I do think it was partly a matter of well-placed individuals in these organizations seeing the merits and getting the Gates Foundation and then Gavi interested. Together with the finance ministries of the countries \u2014 Italy, the UK, Canada, Russia, and Norway \u2014 they built a fund of $1.5 billion. That's orders of magnitude larger than the development programs we tend to see. This funding was for future innovation and not subsistence consumption today, so it requires extra resources. $1.5 billion is a big fund. In a way, the timing was right. Countries were actually doing pretty well \u2014 it was a boom time and development aid was probably getting enriched because countries had extra money to throw in. This was before the global financial crisis actually hit in 2009, and some of these funds dried up, which is maybe part of the story. But as long as you can get countries when they're feeling a bit flush, the question is, \u201cWe want to expand development aid; what's the next idea?\u201d There was some question about the sizing and pricing of the AMC, and one argument against it was that we were going to subsidize these vaccines that might have a pretty high price relative to, say, the polio vaccine. The pneumococcal vaccine was $7 per dose. This is multiples more expensive than a $0.50 per dose polio vaccine, which has been around for 50 years and is easy to produce. We know that polio vaccination is very cost-effective, and we're vaccinating every single person in the world that we can get a hold of. We try to feed people who are starving. What can we move to next that\u2019s also cost-effective but might be more expensive? There was this new thought, \u201cWhy not just give money to poor people? Why give them vaccines?\u201d I think that's an interesting consideration that should always be in the back of one's mind if you're spending $1.5 billion. Should we just do an income transfer and let consumer sovereignty reign? We could spend an hour making the arguments for why some of these income transfer programs are probably a good idea, but it's still worthwhile to have these vaccine programs. They have special benefits \u2014 if a consumer in a low-income country says, \u201cI really want to vaccinate my kid,\u201d they could scream as loud as they want, but that won\u2019t create a market. These things require institutional moves to create markets and vaccines are typically purchased by governments and NGO programs. Direct cash aid was growing in popularity at the time, so I think it was at the back of every developmental economist\u2019s mind. It's a really good benchmark to compare other programs against, but the case for vaccines was pretty strong and there was funding for it. I don't think there was an either/or debate. That's a hard problem, and it was certainly an issue for the economic expert group for the pneumococcal AMC. With these programs, we're focusing on problems of great social need and with limited commercial incentives. That builds in a little bit of safety where you can say, \u201cOkay, I should have paid $4 a dose, but I paid $5. I paid a dollar too much. But still, the social need is there.\u201d We did some work on COVID vaccines, and when we wrote the paper, we estimated that a course of COVID vaccine had the social value of roughly $6,000 in terms of reduced mortality, morbidity, and getting people able to participate in the economy. The prices were ultimately more like 60 bucks a course for the most expensive ones. If you're getting $6,000 of social value, would you worry about paying $31 instead of $30? With problems like that, there's this asymmetric loss where if you go without the product, you lose so much social value relative to the small price you pay to the producers. But it's still an issue in these development areas where the funding is not so rich \u2014 dollars have quite a bit of shadow value to them. There's a political risk to being seen as giving away money to industry. Let's take the pneumococcal vaccine AMC. You can try to make some scientific estimates of how many people are dying and ill and how much of that would get mitigated by a vaccine campaign that's rolled out at a certain rate. Getting a monetary estimate there requires valuing a healthy year of life, but there are techniques for doing that. Even if we are conservative, you get some really high estimates of value. Then you try to think about the costs of R&D and manufacturing. A funder might have vague notions about that, but the firm producers have better private information. So there's this asymmetry of information that puts the funder at a disadvantage. Of course, the firms would like to say, \u201cThis is gonna be really expensive. We're gonna need a really high payment in order to justify the investment.\u201d It is a hard problem, but there's a balance. For a program that has a really high social value, you're gonna err more on the side of having a high price, because that higher price per dose or top-up subsidy increases the chance that it's lucrative enough to induce the participation and investment of the firms. You can actually work out some of the calculations if you have the time, but if you're rushing, you won\u2019t have the two years that it would take to do this full-blown study. There was a huge range of uncertainty in the pneumococcal AMC pilot about the costs of capacity and production for the second-generation vaccine. You can try to look at analogous cases. If it's a vaccine that shares properties with other vaccines, we can compare the production costs. You can talk to former industry officials, which is somewhat fraught because you're not sure where their allegiances lie. Are they with their old industry? If they're talking to you pro bono, presumably it's because they're socially motivated, but it's hard to know. Another approach is to take a step back and, instead of identifying a specific disease as the target, run a competition for AMC candidacy among different possible diseases. If the disease is already chosen, the firms that are vaccine suppliers and doing the research have an incentive to say, \u201cOh, this is really going to be expensive.\u201d But if you're competing to be the disease that the AMC is offered for, you don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s really expensive because that might actually disqualify you. If it's a really novel product, there might not be anything to compare it to, so there might be a huge range of uncertainty. If it's not a very high social benefit, then you'll really want to squeeze things tightly and economize on expenditures. You might not even run the advance market in that case because it's just too close of a margin. Yeah, that may never happen again. I think because this was a pilot program, there was some force of personality there. Some farsighted people working in different administrations saw the merits of the idea. I can't really say what was there for Russia. Norway was part of it, and they're actually the home of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations , which is a Gates-funded vaccine shop. So maybe there's some history there in Norway having a deep interest in vaccines. In the cases of Italy and the UK, they had forces of nature in the finance ministries who really liked the idea and pushed their governments to get involved. We can't really say that this program generated the second-generation vaccine. The R&D likely would have been carried out to create this better vaccine that you could sell for more money to rich countries. Prevnar 7, the first-generation vaccine, was sold at $180 for a three-dose course. It turned out to be a pretty lucrative market. The question is, what good did this program do? Did it speed up the rollout of the campaign to low-income countries? Michael Kremer got the Nobel Prize in economics for running randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in developing countries. You might want to run an RCT to learn the causal effect of the AMC, but it's hard to do when the pilot program is $1.5 billion. You can't necessarily run 10 of those, which wouldn\u2019t be enough data anyway. But there are some measures you can take to try to evaluate it. You can look at the historical rollout of vaccines and the lag before wide-scale availability in poor countries. Dissatisfaction with that lag motivated the whole advance market commitment to begin with; we see historically that it could be a 20-year delay. So you could say that one of the benefits was that it took something like five years to scale up to the same coverage in rich and poor countries. By the way, that $1.5 billion was just the funder subsidy on top of the copayments Gavi made for the vaccines. Over the course of the program, Gavi spent $3.3 billion, so the AMC fund was actually a fraction of the total spend. If you throw $5 billion at a problem, of course you expect to get something for your money. The question is whether that validates the AMC design. In the paper I co-authored with Michael Kremer and John Levin in the American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings, we compared the rollout of the pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines. Gavi invested a similar amount in the rotavirus vaccine, but not with an AMC design. Those are just two data points, but they suggest that it was about five years faster. That wasn't any kind of committed program or subsidy. It was just an advance purchase commitment. For vaccines, a unitary purchaser like Gavi negotiates prices with the manufacturers. The polio vaccine is now basically a generic product with many competing manufacturers, but for these new vaccines, you're dealing with maybe three suppliers. So it's this bilateral monopoly kind of bargaining. Firms are worried that bargaining too hard might reduce their investment incentives. That's one of the possible benefits of this advance market movement: the funder commits to a price or subsidy that sweetens the pot, and they can\u2019t later renege on it. We actually did a little bit of work on it then. The economic expert group was brought in, as these groups often are, to validate the framework design. We did start to see some subtle issue"

    "keywords": "Announcements Many of you have asked for the audio version of Statecraft transcripts, and we\u2019re finally delivering: here\u2019s the Statecraft podcast. Our first episode is the audio of our interview with Laura Thomas, former chief of a CIA base in Afghanistan . It\u2019s a great conversation and we hope you\u2019ll enjoy. Going forward, you can expect podcast versions of the new interviews we conduct, as well as releases of the interviews we\u2019ve already published in transcript form. [ Unfortunately, a few of the interviews we\u2019ve previously released as transcripts are too poor audio quality to make it into podcast form. ] Careful listeners will notice the podcasts and the written transcripts don\u2019t line up exactly. That\u2019s on purpose. In the written format, we edit for clarity and ease of reading, while the podcasts will contain more of the back and forth of Statecraft interviews. For those of you deciding whether to listen or read, you can expect 1-3,000 more words in the uncut podcast audio than in the transcript. In other announcements, we\u2019ve tagged the two series we\u2019ve published on the website, so there are now single links available to our series on Iraq & Afghanistan and on Congress\u2019s Support Agencies . We hope this makes it easier to find and save the sets of interviews you find most helpful. Share them with your friends! Online Dylan Matthews unpacked the mysterious Bureau of Intelligence and Research at the State Department, or, as he calls it, \u201cthe Cassandra of American intelligence,\u201d often right when the other spooks are wrong. In Newsweek , friends of Statecraft Zach Graves and Marci Harris explained the consequences for Congress if the Supreme Court overturns the pillar of the administrative state known as \u201cChevron deference.\u201d \u201cIronically, the effort to dismantle Chevron and return responsibility to the legislative branch may happen amid a historically unproductive and divided Congress\u2026 outside the Court, commentators fear Congress may be too broken to fix. As close watchers of efforts to modernize Congress over the past decade, we don't share that pessimism. But a lot will have to change.\u201d Dave Guarino was interviewed by Asterisk Magazine in a format that will be familiar to Statecraft readers. Come for an explanation of SNAP benefits (and why they too often don\u2019t get to recipients), stay for the stories of traveling to every county in California. A paper from the Niskanen Center\u2019s Ed Dolan argues that liberal democracies tend to have higher state capacity than authoritarian states. In our interview with Jennifer Pahlka , we touched briefly on how perverse incentives can get in federal hiring. For a truly shocking case study, see this deep dive into the FAA\u2019s recent hiring scandal. We\u2019re rereading the classics , too. In Print Readers of this newsletter have regularly recommended Bureaucracy: What Government Agencies Do and Why They Do It , by political scientist James Q. Wilson, and rightfully so: it\u2019s tremendous. Readers of Statecraft will enjoy: \u201cThis book is primarily descriptive: it is an effort to depict the essential features of bureaucratic life in the government agencies of the United States.\u201d Also a good read was Peter Douglas Blair\u2019s monograph , Congress\u2019s Own Think Tank: Learning from the Legacy of the Office of Technology Assessment (1972-1995) . I read it ahead of my interview with Blair, and it\u2019s an excellent, short guide to the OTA, for those interested in going beyond that interview. Less impressive than either of these was Think Tank Aesthetics: Midcentury Modernism, the Cold War, and the Neoliberal Present . Despite participating in a book club full of brilliant minds to parse it, I couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of this book. It\u2019s one part art history, one part history of Cold War think tanks, but nothing seemed to cohere and it was near-impossible to find a thesis or throughline. A disappointment. \u201cIronically, the effort to dismantle Chevron and return responsibility to the legislative branch may happen amid a historically unproductive and divided Congress\u2026 outside the Court, commentators fear Congress may be too broken to fix.

    "keywords": "Over the past month, we\u2019ve interviewed former bigwigs at three of Congress\u2019s major support agencies, the bodies that exist to make Congress smarter, faster, and more effective at its job. In this series, we\u2019ve tackled the Congressional Research Service, an in-house think tank. We\u2019ve covered the Congressional Budget Office and its key role in shaping each year\u2019s federal budget. And we investigated the now-defunct Office of Technology Assessment to better understand why it died and what comes next. To close out this series, today we interviewed the Government Accountability Agency\u2019s Orice Williams Brown . Williams Brown is the Managing Director of GAO\u2019s Office of Congressional Relations. She\u2019s previously led the Financial Markets and Community Investments team, and has produced GAO reports on myriad topics, including financial regulatory oversight, flood insurance, and Treasury\u2019s Troubled Asset Relief Program. How does GAO spot waste in the federal government? What happens when agencies don\u2019t comply with investigations? How does GAO deal with fraud? Do Congress and GAO ever clash? For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: Improper payments cover a range of types. There are payments that shouldn't have been made, payments about which there are questions about whether the people who received them were actually eligible for them, and issues related to not having enough information on the recipients to determine if they were actually eligible to receive them. So improper payments really highlight a whole host of potential control issues that could indicate more serious issues in a program or at an agency. GAO has a number of what we call \u201csignature products\u201d that we put out on an annual or biennial basis. The first one I would mention is our duplication and cost savings report . This is a required report that we produce each year, and it identifies just what it says, duplication, overlap, and fragmentation across agencies and programs in the government. We also include cost savings and revenue enhancements that could yield benefits to the government if our recommendations are acted upon. At one point I was one of the agency co-leads on these reports. But it's an agency-wide effort. We\u2019ll have a particular team or executive run point on it, but they coordinate activities across the agency. There is definitely an evaluative or audit portion of the work as well. When we first started this work, we were mandated to produce this report. In the very first report, we basically went back over our existing body of work and pulled out places where we had organically identified examples of duplication, overlap, and fragmentation. That was the starting basis for this series of reports. Since then, we actually do work at the request of Congress. Sometimes there are mandates. There are provisions in law for us to look into possible duplication or fragmentation in a particular program. In other places, we will proactively do work to determine if, in fact, that is the case in a program. Then we try to determine whether it's really duplication, which actually happens less frequently. Pure duplication refers to programs or activities doing the exact same thing and providing a benefit to the exact same population. The overlap and fragmentation are much more common in terms of programs that overlap. You have a particular population that is eligible to receive benefits from a cross-section of programs. Many housing programs, for example, are fragmented because there are several programs, and an individual could be eligible for some combination of those government programs. We really pull together this information from a cross-section of activities. We do have a back-and-forth conversation with agencies. They want to make sure we have a clear understanding of the program, the population served by the program, and how it works. I think there is always a tension with duplication, overlap, and fragmentation. You have to be careful. The assumption can\u2019t be that if there are 57 programs that do X, then you don't need 57 programs, and all of them should be eliminated except for one. But it's often much more complicated than that because there will be nuances about what population is served. Programs often proliferate because an initial program isn't fully functioning as it was originally envisioned and intended. A new program will be created to address the perceived missing component of the program that already exists. And then, ten years later, someone will say, \u201cOh, but it doesn't really focus on this particular subpopulation. So we need another program to specifically address that subpopulation.\u201d I think that is how programs with overlapping or fragmented missions tend to proliferate over time. I can definitely see a pattern: We have housing programs that cover a wide range of people, but we don't have a program that's specifically dedicated to veterans. Veterans have specific housing needs, so we're going to create a program that targets veterans. And then we'll say, \u201cThere's a subset of veterans that are homeless. So we need a program that targets the homeless veteran population.\u201d And then among the homeless veterans, there are female veterans, but there was no program that focused on homeless female veterans. \u201cSo we need a program that focuses on homeless veterans.\u201d And that's how it plays out, across a whole host of programs. Does that dynamic ever occur? I think the relationship has really evolved. When I started at GAO in 1990, I would say it was much more adversarial. Now, and we've always said this, but I think more agencies tend to believe us when we say, \u201cwe're from GAO and we're here to help.\u201d That really is how we approach it. We take seriously our mission: to support the Congress in exercising its constitutional responsibilities, but also to look for ways to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of government on behalf of taxpayers and the American people. We enter a conversation with that spirit. We don't do gotcha audits. We are clear with the agency about our key questions. We ask them questions. We also review documents and conduct physical inspections. We have a closeout at the end of the engagement, where we lay out all of the facts as we understand them based on the evidence that we have collected. We also give agencies an opportunity to comment on our draft reports, and we include their comment letters in our final published product. So they have an opportunity to weigh in. I think that many times, they understand and see the value of GAO and appreciate the fact that we can actually help them achieve their goals and make government work better. I think everyone wants to do the right thing by \u2014 most people want to do the right thing on behalf of taxpayers. Many of them see that GAO can be an effective partner in that space. We also produce a biennial report called our high-risk report . This report is produced by GAO at the beginning of each new Congress. We lay out the top areas that need the Congress's attention, areas that need transformation. They're at risk of fraud, waste, and abuse. And we have a list that we track over time. In the intervening time between each new report, we\u2019re doing work to update the areas on the list. We rate them against a series of criteria: leadership commitment, capacity, action plan, monitoring and demonstrated progress are the five areas they are rated on. The goal is to work with the Congress and to get agencies to effect the necessary change for it to no longer be deemed high-risk. Sometimes the Congress actually needs to take action to address a particular area on the list. We started the list in the 1990s, and a couple of areas have been on the list for the entire time. Cybersecurity continues to be an area of concern and focus for us, as the threats and the type of risk and exposure for government continue to evolve, but that is an example of an area that's been on the list for for a really long time and still warrants dedicated attention. Other areas on the list are contract management and acquisitions. This area has been a challenge and permeates across government. Many agencies struggle to ensure that the contracting process is executed, overseen, and carried out appropriately. Yes, we actually issued a report a couple years ago that focused on areas to provide a way forward and we laid out the keys to success. We wanted to make it clear to agencies that there are success stories. We found leadership, commitment, capacity, having a clear plan of action, and monitoring are all ways to do that. There are a couple of areas that we have identified where agencies took action. They provided dedicated attention, and they were able to come off the list over time. One was about \u201c federal excess and underutilized properties .\u201d Congress really focused on this area because the federal government owns a lot of property, and for years, we\u2019ve been pointing out that the government didn't have a comprehensive sense of where the properties were, their condition, and whether it still needed all of them. So Congress passed \u2014 and the president signed \u2014 two reform bills to address this issue. OMB also developed a strategic framework to help guide agencies\u2019 real property management. This has resulted in a decrease in lease costs. And it also led us to narrow the scope of this high-risk area in 2011, and then again in 2021. We estimate that focusing on this area resulted in $3.6 billion in savings and an additional $4.7 billion in lease cost avoidance through 2023. That's an example of an area that actually resulted in financial benefits because appropriate action was taken. I will also highlight the monitoring area and supply chain management issues. For example, Congress established statutory requirements for the Department of Defense (DoD) to submit comprehensive plans for improved asset visibility monitoring. DoD leaders subsequently developed a detailed corrective action plan to carry out that requirement and a process for ongoing monitoring. Those actions alone contributed nearly $3.7 billion in savings between FY 2006 and 2019. As a result, this area came off the high-risk list in 2019. I think we definitely work hard to do our part. We think we play a significant role, and we think the investment in GAO is a sound investment of taxpayer dollars. I would look at the period of the pandemic. GAO recently produced its first government-wide estimate of potential fraud , and, in the federal government, we've looked at the period of 2018 through 2022. We estimate that anywhere from a quarter to half a trillion dollars annually was spent fraudulently. You had fraud in the Paycheck Protection Program , the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program at the Small Business Administration, there was organized crime involved there. There was Unemployment Insurance fraud, state-level fraud. It\u2019s just mind-boggling. I think part of it is driven by the amount of funds expended during that period, but also just not having effective controls in place on the front end as the programs were being stood up. Some agencies have the notion that you have to choose mission or fiscal responsibility. GAO's position is you can accomplish both. You can have basic controls in place and still execute the mission and get funds out to people who desperately need them. We recently developed a framework for emergency programs, to help agencies think about having the controls they need in place before the emergency actually happens, so they aren't scrambling to do it in the moment. I think there are a couple of basic things. One is just to put basic controls in place. A lot of programs relied on self-reported income. We've pushed agencies to make sure that agencies have some basic controls in place. One of the programs involved just pushing out some basic funds to a group of eligible taxpayers. So they were given hundreds of dollars of relief. And we found that a lot of those dollars were pushed out to dead people. Just basic controls like checking the Social Security Administration's \u201c death master file ,\u201d whichTreasury now has access to. So there are certain basics that we believe will be beneficial for agencies to be able to verify before they push out funds. So this was actually the Treasury\u2019s Economic Impact Payments : which basically provided payments to certain taxpayers who had paid taxes in a certain period, that's what they used as the trigger point. Some received a check in the mail for up to $1,400. This was supplemental assistance at the height of the pandemic. At the time, Treasury didn't have access to the full death master file. With just that basic information, they would have been able to avoid sending checks to dead people. GAO is an independent agency within the legislative branch. So we've always had a close relationship with Congress to provide it with fact-based, nonpartisan, objective, non-ideological information. We work hard to remain the source of that independent, nonpartisan information. The composition of the work that we've done for Congress has evolved in my 30-plus years at GAO. When I started, we did a fairly large percentage of work under the authority of the Comptroller General, which means it was work that we self-initiated. I have seen that percentage change over time. Now, the self-initiated work that we actually start under the authority of the Comptroller General is probably around the 5-6% range, and much more of our work is requested through mandates from the Congress. Congress will include a provision in a law or a committee report for GAO to conduct a study in a particular area. The rest comes from requests from the chair and ranking members of committees. I think the shift was intentional on GAO's part because we want to make sure that we're doing the work that Congress needs us to do. That was a big part of the shift. It has continued to evolve. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) generally includes over 100 mandates for us to do work on a range of areas. The appropriations bills will also include a whole host of mandates. Mandates are our number one priority. They move to the top of the list because they're grounded in law and usually have a deadline associated with them. We really do work closely with the Congress. Committees often contact us before a mandate appears, asking us to weigh in and inform the mandate. Usually, when we get a mandate, we are aware of it. It doesn't come to us cold. It will happen every once in a while, but for the most part, we are part of the conversation around something being turned into a mandate. That's also the case for requests. GAO has a five-year strategic plan. We work with clients and other external parties to frame the plan, but our plan is informed by the needs and interests of Congress. So, when a committee is contemplating sending us a request, they will often reach out to us to make sure it is something that we have the authority to do. Yes. When we look at timelines, it's usually just around a scheduling issue. We\u2019ll say, \u201cHey, it may make sense to give us more time to complete this mandate because we\u2019ll need a little bit of time to start the work.\u201d When bills are dropped, we\u2019ll also look at draft mandate language, and every so often, something will raise constitutional concerns. GAO really isn't the appropriate agency to execute a mandate because it's a core executive branch function, so it really shouldn\u2019t be done by a legislative branch agency. Occasionally, draft language will imply that GAO will be making a decision about a program, such as if Congress wanted GAO to opine on a grant as part of the approval process for a grant program. If we're then asked to oversee the program, that could encumber our independence. That's where an issue could come up: We're asked to perform an executive branch function that then encumbers our ability to do oversight of the program because we've been involved in the decision-making process. That would be an example of a role it would be inappropriate for GAO to play. We want to be clear about the scope. Occasionally draft legislation will ask us to \u201cfind all examples of X.\u201d We\u2019ll often ask: \u201cAre there particular programs, particular aspects or examples?\u201d We'll try to scope the work to something that is doable in the time frame that they have in mind for us to do it. [ pause ] It\u2019s a process with agencies. There are agencies that require more conversations. It's not uncommon with new administrations that you may have people who join the government who are unfamiliar with GAO. We have broad access authority. Sometimes folks who are unfamiliar with GAO and its access authority will not fully appreciate how broad our authority is. So our attorneys will have to educate them about our audit authority and what we actually have access to. It's not a question of whether we'll get the information; it's how hard we are going to have to work to get it. For the most part, agencies understand that. But when we encounter issues, we have a process internally where we escalate them and try to work through them to ensure we're getting the information we need in a timely manner. We have broad access to information. If documents have been created, we have access to them. We have folks who have appropriate levels of security clearance. If we're dealing with classified information, we have people who know how to handle it appropriately. If an agency has information that we need to carry out our oversight responsibilities, then we have access to that information. We work really hard to build a multidisciplinary workforce. Most recently, GAO was asked to build out our strength in the science and tech space. We have always had scientists and technologists sprinkled throughout the agency. At the behest of Congress, we pulled them all into one new team called the Science, Technology Assessment and Analytics team . We have grown that team, increased the number of experts. We work hard to have the skills that we need to do the work that Congress asked of us because we recognize that GAO is expected to cover the waterfront when it comes to the federal government. So we need to have skills and experts that cut across all of the federal government. We work hard to make sure we have a workforce reflective of that, and to continue to get better at offering a variety of services. Sometimes it's a quick turnaround request where a committee or member is looking for some specific information and it needs it quickly, to the in-depth, deep dive reports that include recommendations and a lot of analysis. We're working to make sure that we serve both of those lanes. One area that we continue to work on is ensuring that we're getting Congress information when they need it. We're making sure our work lines up with the congressional calendar and also with the requesters of the work, recognizing that members in the House are up for reelection every two years. We have to be mindful that we're leaving enough daylight for those members to be able to act on the work that we're doing for them. Definitely, and we're mindful of this, which is why we have built out the different types of services. With the tech assessments that we do, we actually have developed a short-range tech assessment, where we do something in a shorter timeframe so we can get information to the Congress on an emerging technology within a specific time window, so it's not going to take a year or longer for them to get that information. [ We covered the history of the OTA in depth last week: ] For 20 years, Congress had a dedicated \u201cOffice of Technology Assessment,\u201d or OTA, meant to provide Congress with an unbiased assessment of science and technology. The OTA was touted as a key tool to keep the American government ahead of the curve on the most important issues of the future. What things cause GAO to move slower than you might like? Is it culture? Tech? GAO has, by"

The OTA was touted as a key tool to keep the American government ahead of the curve on the most important issues of the future. But in 1995, after Republicans swept into power, the OTA was shuttered. Its critics claimed it was a partisan entity, unfocused, and frequently too slow to help Congress. Today, some observers want it back, to inform Congress on issues like generative AI, gene editing, and quantum computing. How valuable was the OTA, actually? Today, we talk to Peter Douglas Blair , former Assistant Director of the OTA, and author of the 2012 book Congress\u2019s Own Think Tank: Learning from the Legacy of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment. Why don\u2019t congressmen read? What role did the OTA play in deregulating the power industry? Does Congress still need a dedicated OTA? Why are agencies killed? For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: I'm not sure. I think most observers of the time, including Peter Drucker, presumed that an agency like OTA would not survive in a highly partisan environment. And, arguably, that ultimately proved to be the case. But over its 23-year history, it navigated the cross-currents reasonably well and functioned as a pretty useful resource as the role of science and technology grew in the congressional agenda and public policy debate. Because of the highly partisan environment we\u2019re in at the moment, I think that Drucker's observation is probably even more apt today than it was then. There were several major forces at work. The general one I just described: the role of science and technology became increasingly important across the congressional agenda. At the time, Congress was concerned that it was being left out of such issues by the executive branch. In fact, until the early \u201870s, Congress largely ceded jurisdiction over science and technology issues to the executive branch. Coming out of the Cold War, the role of government in science and technology was increasing as well; how to do that responsibly became a major issue before the Congress. The committee deliberations that went on in the late \u201860s and early \u201870s ultimately concluded that there was a way for Congress to design an institution that could help it play a role in fashioning the nation's S&T agenda. There were several. I think one was the overwhelming focus on its balance between the two chambers of Congress and making it a bicameral institution. Another was the high priority of trying to stay out of the values-based part of the debate. OTA focused on informing the debate rather than making policy recommendations that would require incorporating information beyond the assessment. Except for its very first assessment . I think the OTA saw the writing on the wall that that was probably a mistake. In all future assessments, it did not make recommendations and instead focused on articulating possible consequences. I suppose some people would argue that recommendations could be gleaned from how they presented the consequences of alternative options, but I don\u2019t think that was the intention. The intention really was to look at the strengths and weaknesses of alternative options in a broader context than other organizations typically did: focusing on S&T but incorporating the broader dimensions of a policy debate as well. They changed over the years. Initially, the stock and trade was the document called a technology assessment, which was typically a broad-based look at an area that had dominant S&T features. The assessment report was the principal deliverable. There was a fairly elaborate process for initiating OTA assessments, acquiring the expertise to inform the assessments, staffing them to produce the results, and disseminating the findings. But over the years, the increasing inventory of assessments allowed the agency to build on them with narrower, deeper dives into particular areas. For example, in the \u201880s, the agency did a big study on the prospects of deregulating the electric power industry, which led to growing the transmission and distribution system across the country. One of the concerns was the degree to which the increased electromagnetic magnetic fields from the added transmission lines would affect the environment, so follow-up studies were initiated to look at those issues. And similar things happened across the board \u2014 with healthcare, defense, and other environmental issues. So there were facilities for doing so-called background papers that helped inform debates. Those might've been the result of a workshop. There were also special memoranda that elaborated on a policy option or updated information related to an assessment. Those all happened over time. But the technology assessment itself was still the principal deliverable of OTA assessment teams. I would say that their staff read them more than they did. There were some senators who actually read OTA reports \u2014 the one-page summaries were affectionately called \u201cSenator-sized summaries.\u201d The agency spent an enormous amount of time trying to distill the principal messages into packages that would actually be read by senators. Some staff, particularly on the committees that commissioned the studies, devoured the OTA assessment reports and reported the results of their reading to members. That was less often the case in the individual members\u2019 offices. That ultimately became one of the key vulnerabilities of the agency, that its constituency was largely vested in the committees and not in the rank-and-file members. I remember both double-spaced as well as larger font. In the early \u201880s, it became much more feasible to do double-sided pages, so a one-pager actually had additional information, charts, graphs, and references on the back. When the agency was building to its peak level of influence in the \u201880s, many of the members of the Technology Assessment Board (TAB), which oversaw the OTA, were already chairs of the standing committees in the House and Senate. I included in the monograph a table from 1988, when the chairs of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , the Foreign Relations Committee , and on the House side, the Energy and Commerce and Science and Tech committees \u2014 most of the committees involved in science and technology issues \u2014 had members on the TAB. They probably collectively felt that it was an overreach for OTA to invoke subpoena power. From Blair\u2019s Congress's Own Think Tank: Learning from the Legacy of the Office of Technology Assessment Truth be told, whenever we needed information and agencies were reluctant to provide it, we could call on the board members to help. If necessary, they could issue a subpoena on behalf of the standing committee rather than OTA itself. Often, purely technical information about the structure of a government R&D program, or potentially useful results of an analysis. When I was running the energy program, there were many R&D programs that kept track of the cost and performance of alternative technologies. It would have been much more efficient for us to use that information than to go out and try to reinvent the wheel to acquire it. Even if an agency program manager was reluctant to provide it, we usually prevailed. When the agency began, it was envisaged that the work would principally be done by contractors, and there would be a very small staff to coordinate the contract studies. And several of the early studies were indeed carried out that way. There was a core permanent staff of 140-odd members that was divided into programs. But their principal role was to actually write the reports and use the contractor's input to assemble them. Over time it became clear that it was important to cast OTA reports in language that was more accessible to congressional committees and members. Yeah, they weren't. They were written as largely technical reports and generally didn't incorporate the broader context of the congressional decision-making challenges. They were written at a level of abstraction that congressional staff could not absorb easily, so they needed translators to read the report. The agency needed to make technology assessment reports more useful to the Congress, both in terms of additional policy context and in helping to explain highly technical stuff in a way that policymakers could understand. Indeed, I think that was very much the case. Of course, it depended a lot on the topic and timing. One of OTA's principal challenges was getting something done in time to be useful to the Congress, so you had to anticipate the agenda and launch an assessment if the committees were interested. Sometimes, the stars aligned, and an OTA report became very influential. I'm thinking of one from the late \u201880s when Congress was debating how to implement the Clean Air Act . There were a lot of tradeoffs inherent in that topic, so the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee had a lot of questions to evaluate. After OTA\u2019s initial assessment report came out, the staff became, as Senator Stevens used to call them, the \u201cshared staff feature of the OTA.\u201d They were seen as a resource that both sides of a committee could call upon for initial modeling related to what they found in the assessment: Say, whether or not particular provisions in a bill would affect a given state. If resources become limited, there is an inherent tension in deciding between what to do in anticipation of the agenda, vs. what the committees want done now. Governor Peterson , who was the second director of OTA, wanted to return the agency to more of a foresight function. So he launched this priorities effort, which produced a fascinating list that was considered by TAB. Again, a lot of committee chairs sat on the TAB and they decided that this undermined their ability to get what they wanted done. With a limited set of resources, one was going to take priority over the other. From Congress\u2019s Own Think Tank I think Governor Peterson's initiative was perhaps an overreach. He wanted to move the agency primarily in that foresight direction, rather than to balance between what the committees wanted and anticipating what was going on. Jack Gibbons tried to split the difference when he became director and develop ways in which the agency could be more prepared. For example, he elevated the role of the Technology Assessment Advisory Council (TAAC), a group of external advisors, and tasked them with helping structure and staff OTA to anticipate the agenda. But TAAC didn't actually initiate assessments. Now, there were exceptions, and sometimes even those became somewhat controversial for the TAB, since they knew that it was a scarce resource that had to be allocated. The electric power study that I mentioned earlier was actually, in part, a foresight activity. The agency and the board recognized that the electric power industry was undergoing enormous turmoil, and the nuclear power industry was in disarray because of cost overruns and the way nuclear power was regulated at the state level. There was insufficient transmission, and new alternative technologies were on the horizon. OTA, partly through informal urging of the committees, was trying to prepare for that future and began to study the potential deregulation of the industry. The formal question posed was, \u201cWould the system fall apart if we deregulated it?\u201d The agency found that, \u201cNo, you'd have to do it carefully, but technically you could navigate an industry with increased competition.\u201d And that is indeed what happened. I remember Congressman Dingell being particularly appreciative because he was the monkey in the middle of this problem; the utilities were screaming at him, saying that the industry was going to fall apart. There were only a handful of electric utilities advocating for increased competition, which would theoretically reduce costs considerably. Congress benefited enormously from OTA's contribution in that particular area. OTA was pretty early in the climate change debate, in healthcare, and in biotechnology, too. That set of three reports was very badly received by the Reagan administration and congressional Republicans. How big of a role did those reports play in OTA's later shuttering? I don't think it was the most significant factor in its demise. Those who didn\u2019t look into how the reports were produced thought it was due to partisan bias. I was there at the time, and it was certainly not that \u2014 the OTA reports were largely a technical debate. Ash\u2019s first issue was a background paper. That background work was very important in shaping the ultimate assessment report, but it was very narrowly conceived as, \u201cWould SDI work?\u201d At the time, the evidence was pretty clear that, as envisioned initially, it wouldn\u2019t. There could have been a lot of reasons for issuing the report other than investigating whether those technical issues could be resolved, but at the time there was a widespread perception that it was a partisan deliberation. But I don't think it was ultimately the reason why the agency fell to the ax. There were several. One I mentioned earlier was the lack of a constituency among the rank-and-file members. OTA\u2019s constituents were largely the leadership of the standing committees. So when there was a big turnover in the Congress, as there was in the 104th when a third of the membership changed, the brand new members didn't know what OTA was, didn't care, didn't think it was important. The leadership changed and they were unfamiliar with the history of the agency and its role. If OTA were to be reconstituted, one of its challenges would be to develop that broader support. I suggest a number of ways it could be done in the monograph, but that was one of the major issues: at a political inflection point for the Congress, OTA was left without a strong constituency . Another reason was symbolic. The Contract with America specified many reductions in the support service agencies. I think GAO lost close to 1000 people \u2014 I forget the exact number, maybe it was 700, but it was an order of magnitude more than OTA [ NB: Between 1992-1998, GAO\u2019s headcount was reduced by 39% ]. OTA was maybe 1% of the legislative branch budget, but Contract with America proponents could claim that they cut an entire agency for a 1% reduction in the budget. It was very convenient to be able to do that, and some members didn\u2019t feel the agency was important anyway. Lastly, the timeliness issue, which I think all supporting agencies struggle with, was a problem for OTA. One possible exception is the CRS , which does more off-the-shelf work, but even they get criticized for being slow sometimes. All of the other sources of advice have the same problem. I worked at the National Academies for 20 years, and we suffered with that issue constantly, maybe more so than at the OTA. That suggests OTA died because of an explicit political battle, rather than because it was unhelpful, or not worth the cost. I think today that very well could be the issue, but at the time, I'm not sure that it was. Today, the partisan divide is deeper than it was even then. And some values trump the issues of the time, so I think I agree with Jack now. By the way, when was that quote from? Yeah, that wasn't 1995. In the 1990s, particularly at the committee level, there was still some degree of bipartisan cooperation in crafting legislation. Today that's a really rough road. I want to ask you about that second point. Back then and today, are congressmen getting scientific advice directly from scientists? If they\u2019re not getting it from OTA, where are they getting technical expertise? They are getting plenty of advice, lots of advice, often from scientists and organizations. The question is, what kind of advice? When I came to the National Academies, I became very aware of the different kinds of advice that go to the Congress. We had the best and the brightest scientists in the world, but many conversations between a Nobel Laureate and a member of Congress were he said, she said. In my second monograph , I talk about how the advice that is most effective for Congress is independent, objective, relevant, timely, and actionable. In 2005, I was in a hearing on this subject, and Congressman Rohrabacher posed the same issue to me that Mr. Gingrich did in your quote. At the time, California was undergoing an enormous housing crisis. There were many problems, and I said, \u201cWhat you really need, Congressman, is a house inspector. Somebody independent who can assess all of the information that's out there, assess its quality, tune it to the needs of the Congress \u2014 all of the things that OTA did that other organizations and individuals are not doing now.\u201d I spent a few years at Sigma Xi , the Scientific Research Honor Society, which has chapters at many universities around the country. We experimented with a science advisory function, whereby members of individual chapters would develop relationships with their congressional representatives. It was much more likely that scientists would be received well in a congressional office in their own district. That worked out in some instances, but it took enormous effort to train scientists to communicate effectively with a congressman and to convey useful, substantive information. I think that's the distinction that Newt missed completely there: yeah, you can get information from scientists, but what kind of information are you getting? That's the role that OTA really provided. Let\u2019s take AAAS as an example \u2014 which is one of the most successful, by the way \u2014 where scientists come in sponsored by the professional societies and become science advisors in members\u2019 offices or in committee offices. Similarly to my experience with the science advisory function that Sigma Xi tried to do, those scientists go through an enormous transformation. Going from the bench to becoming aware enough of the legislative context when providing science advice is a heavy lift. In terms of getting science advisors to fill that role, sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. CRS uses off-the-shelf information and acts as an advisor on individual issues, which has proven enormously effective for the Congress, but it's not necessarily at the cutting edge of an issue. If a lot hasn't been published on the topic, you need to convene a bunch of experts to assemble that information and make an assessment based on the current context. CRS does that every now and then, but that was basically what OTA did. I think GAO is also trying to do that, but it has had challenges fulfilling that aspiration. It would have to be conditional. I would certainly support reinventing the function within one of the existing agencies, whether at GAO or maybe even CRS. But I do think it would be easier just to start over; since the agency's actually already authorized, all you have to do is appropriate the funds. Even so, the agency would have to be very different than it was a quarter of a century ago. The context for how it would function has changed, the needs have changed, and the access to advice and expertise has improved. There would have to be a lot of changes, but the basic structure is there and could be built upon. You could do it either way. Unfortunately, the features that gave strength to OTA assessments, like peer review and access to expert staff and external advisors, are not getting realized in the GAO function. First and foremost, technology could help address structural weaknesses. CRS and OTA could collaborate to build a network of information that would be much more accessible to rank-and-file members, rather than just to the standing committees. Communicating as we are now [ Zoom ] and other forms of electronic information gathering were not available to OTA then; it would make the process mu"

    "keywords": "Dr. Doug Holtz-Eakin has worn many hats. He was Chief Economist on George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors, and directed Domestic and Economic Policy for the John McCain presidential campaign in 2008. These days he runs the American Action Forum , a center-right think tank. But today, we\u2019re talking to him about his time as the 6th Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) , which provides budgetary analysis to the U.S. Congress. From 2003-2005, Holtz-Eakin supported Congress as it addressed major policies including the 2003 tax cuts and Medicare prescription drug bill, and the 2005 Social Security reform push. Why do congressmen pretend to be mad at the CBO? What\u2019s wrong with the American budget process? Why is the 10th year of a budget projection \u201cworthless\u201d? This is the second in a four-interview series on Congress\u2019s support agencies. You can read the first installment here, on the Congressional Research Service: How to Teach Congress to Do Its Job Santi Ruiz \u00b7 May 8, 2024 Read full story For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: You responded at the time by calling that attack \u201cludicrous.\u201d Why was it ludicrous? First of all, you have to consider the source. When I was CBO director, Mr. Gingrich came in, talked to me, and said, \u201cYou're doing a great job. It's nice to see a Republican being effective in this position.\u201d And the next morning, the Washington Post ran an op-ed by him calling for the abolition of the CBO. It's a little inconsistent. More generally, the CBO is none of those things. The CBO works for the Congress, and so it doesn't have its own agenda, reactionary or otherwise. It has Congress's agenda. It operates and produces its research based on the large body of research that's produced outside of the CBO in the research community. When the CBO has an estimate, it uses the consensus of the research literature. It doesn't have its own view that is somehow different from what's been found in the large body of research. Those are big misconceptions about how CBO does things. So the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 created the CBO, the budget committees, and the modern budget process . It arose because then-President Nixon was not spending monies that Congress had appropriated for specific purposes. The executive branch was not executing laws that the Congress had passed and the executive had signed. The Office of Management and Budget was the only budgetary institution in town. Congress was utterly reliant on the executive branch for all its budgetary information. And in the aftermath of this dispute, which went all the way to the Supreme Court, they decided they wanted to be able to do their own work. And in what was just a flat \u201clet's balance the powers\u201d move, it created its own budgetary institutions, including the CBO, to have data, make projections, and allow them to assess the budgetary outlook and alternatives to it and different pieces of legislation. That seems appropriate. If we're going to have an executive branch that has its budgetary analysis, Congress is entitled to an independent view, and that's what they created. They're different institutions. I've worked in the White House twice, and I've run the CBO. And if you are in the White House or at OMB or the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) , your only objective is implementing the president's agenda. OMB is there to formulate the president's budget and implement it to the best of its ability in the actions of the agencies, and it has oversight of the agencies through their management functions. That's a very particular kind of advocacy role. You're trying to get something done. CBO is not that at all. It\u2019s nonpartisan and does not make policy recommendations. It is not trying to get something done; it's providing the information to its client, the Congress, as the Congress decides what it wants to get done. They have some overlap in that both are interested in annual discretionary appropriations and defense and non-defense decisions. But OMB doesn't analyze entitlement programs or mandatory spending. CBO has both discretionary and mandatory spending, so it's an entirely different institution. Having been in both the White House and working for Congress, where do you fall on this debate? So, I first want everyone to understand that this is quantitatively irrelevant. Historically, the total impoundments have been in the double-digit billions. This is less than Medicare fraud in a single year, so it's not going to change the budgetary outlook. So it really is simply a power issue. I think that the current situation is the correct one. I don't agree with Nixon. Nixon and any president has every chance to shape the appropriations bills during their deliberation and passage. White House staffs exist to do that logrolling and campaigning for people and all the other ways that you can influence folks. If you didn't get it done, then it's over; the law passed, and you signed it into law. You do not then get to turn around and say, no, it's not right. So I'm not a big fan of those positions. First, CBO supports Congress in its budget process. I'm going to describe the cycle as it was envisioned in the \u201874 Act, with the caveat that it doesn't happen this way in practice. In January, CBO would release the budget and economic outlook, the starting point for the budget cycle. That's a projection of what the economy will look like if we put current law on autopilot. What will happen to the budget? What revenue will we collect? What spending will we have? It would then receive the president's budget and analyze it. The President would have some claims, and CBO would reanalyze the same proposals and give Congress its view of them. At that point, Congress would begin deliberations on a budget resolution in the House and Senate, ultimately agreeing on a budget plan, a joint budget resolution that said, \u201cWhat are we going to do to change taxation? What are we going to do to change spending?\u201d And off it would go to execute the laws, the appropriations bills and the entitlement and other reforms that it might want. In that process, CBO would provide scores on each piece of legislation, answering the question, \u201cIf this legislation became law, how would revenues into the Treasury and spending out change over the course of the 10-year budget window?\u201d It's been different lengths over time. So it's supporting that, on a regular basis, all those cost estimates. In August, when Congress is presumably on recess, CBO would publish the summer updates of the budget. \u201cYou guys did all this stuff. Where do we stand?\u201d Congress is supposed to close the books by September 30th. CBO then spends time looking back, redoing its budget and economic outlook, updating for new laws and new economic conditions, and starts over in January. So there's a cycle of budgetary products. There's a daily flow of requests for scores on different versions of legislation to change those budget outlooks. In many people's view, that's the primary function of CBO. When I was there, there were 230 people there, 190 of whom had advanced degrees. There's an enormous amount of expertise on that floor. CBO also supports Congress by doing studies to answer questions like: \u201cWhat are options for single-payer health care? What are the implications of a carbon tax for the budget and the emission of greenhouse gasses into the economy?\u201d There's no question you can't ask CBO to analyze. A number of studies from CBO are really laying the groundwork for future legislation. They are educational products for when Congress wants to get smart on this or that. When I was there, at the request of then-House Budget Chairman Jim Nussle , we did a whole series of studies on what happens if we have to make Fannie and Freddie wards of the state. That turned out to be true, but we were studying it well before it happened. \u201cHow much would it cost taxpayers if the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation goes belly up?\u201d Which it probably will. That's laying the groundwork for fixes to both of those institutions. Often you can't just have any budgetary impacts. You have limits on it. Maybe there's been an agreement in a budget resolution that says, \u201cWe're not going to spend more than $800 billion this year.\u201d So you're doing the scores, and if they add up to more than $800 billion, Congress is going to have to change something. Or they\u2019re using special budgetary procedures like reconciliation, which allows you to bypass the filibuster in the Senate and pass things with a simple majority (and not 60 votes). Reconciliation instructions are very precise. They tell each committee in both the House and the Senate what they're allowed to do to the budget. The CBO scores essentially bless the legitimacy of the product; otherwise, they cannot be voted on. Eh, no. First of all, I would say there's a fair amount of faux antipathy, because CBO is a convenient institution to hide behind. You complain, \u201cCBO is moving slowly, we'd like to have this done, but we're waiting for the CBO score,\u201d and often that's not true: You don't have the votes yet. But that's what you\u2019re telling people. Or you can't get what you want, so you blame the CBO score. I came to understand I had this psychosocial role, of being beaten up and getting kicked like the dog. That's just allowing Congress to vent, and that was fine. There is real antipathy sometimes. The interesting thing is that it did not come on the big bills. I was there for the tax cuts in 2003, the Medicare Modernization Act that gave us Part D, and some really big moves. The real anger came over pet projects, often relatively small dollar numbers that we said were not small enough, and they didn't get into the bill. Congressmen or Senators had promised it back home, and it wasn't happening, and they were just angry. Yeah. People care most when they own something. No one owns really huge reforms, and there are many actors, but, you know, \u201cThat dam project, boy, I want to build that dam, and CBO\u2019s wrong.\u201d I think it's simpler than that. I think Congress should pass a budget process reform bill, and I don't care what's in it. It could modify the Budget Act so that we have a debt-to-GDP target or something as small as that. But in the process of deliberating on that bill and then turning it into law, they would now own the budget process. It would be theirs. This Congress. So it's not the dead hand of some guy from 1974 telling me to do something. They don't care. But if they agreed, then at least for a couple of years, they're going to feel obligated to do that, and we'd have a process that functions. But this is not an interesting concept to the current Congress. Yes, and especially if the leadership said, \u201cOctober 1st is a real deadline and we\u2019ve got to be done by then.\u201d They wouldn't be thinking we can always do this on Christmas Eve, which they do a lot. They take the time because they feel they can. That's all. That's all that's happening. Not exactly. A word about scoring and models probably more than any of your listeners ever wanted to know. Scores are the budgetary implications of a piece of legislation. The answer to the question, \u201cHow much will revenues into and spending out of the Treasury change over the next 10 year by year as a result of implementing this Scores are computed relative to a baseline. As I said, CBO puts out a baseline in January, it updates it after doing the president's budget. At that point in time, the baseline is frozen, so all proposals are compared against the same benchmark, even if the economy, as it did say in 2020, collapses shortly thereafter. Okay. The baseline is there. So you're comparing against the same baseline that gives you some consistency and the whole purpose of scores is to rank things appropriately. They're not forecasts. If you were a good forecaster, you would update the starting point as you went through the year to be more accurate. That's not the primary purpose. The primary purpose is to find out whether Proposal A costs more than B and B costs more than C, and then not conclude that C costs more than A. You don't want to send conflicting information like that to Congress. They'll go crazy. So getting the right ordering is the primary purpose. Putting the outcomes somewhere close to reality is a goal, there's no question about it. But in many cases, your hands are tied in ways such that you're not going to get that goal. Big pieces of legislation often span over a year. You hold on to the original baseline and keep scoring against that so that you don't upset everything. By the time some of these final scores get done, they are well divorced from reality. Further down the road, Congress changes a bunch of things, and then people look back and say, \u201cCBO wasn't even close.\u201d Yeah, there are reasons for that. Scoring is a judgment science. We hire, train, and pay the CBO experts to give us their best judgment about the path of revenues and spending over the budget window. Models can and do inform judgments. If you have formal models, they help you figure out what's going to happen. If you have experience with Medicaid expansions \u2014 and they've been done a lot before \u2014 you can look back and see how they happened. You can go to lots of sources to inform your judgment but in the end, we're asking people to make judgments. I was asked to score terrorism risk insurance , the federal budget backstop to the private property and casualty insurance industry, in the event it went bankrupt from the implications of an unknown terrorist attack at an unknown time in an unknown location with an unknown weapon. There is no model. We made a judgment about the cost of that act and that was our job. I think people often have the misconception that CBO just drops the legislation into a computer and out it comes. That's not true. If you've got to make judgments, you make them based on what we know from the research literature about, in that case, terrorist events and the probability distribution of them. It turns out there's a lot of terror in the world over time, and people went and studied it. CBO is quite serious about the scoring of bills. It's not that they can't pick up any models. It's that as a matter of their professional practice and pursuit of the mission, they will not use just any old model, they'll use the one that is best suited for that purpose. Yes, the formal role is to provide these cost estimates and to allow Congress to make good decisions and you have to give them consistent information. First and foremost, A is bigger than B and B is bigger than C. If you're updating all the time, you might flip those. Sometimes there's a tough call to be made on something like that. For example, after the pandemic in March 2020, CBO reissued a baseline, because we lost 20 million jobs in the month of April, and that was 10x worse than any month in U S. economic history. It didn't make sense to score a stimulus bill of two and a half trillion dollars against a baseline that said there was no recession, right? That would have led to bizarre things. When that happens, CBO doesn't reissue baselines unilaterally. It works for the budget committees, first and foremost, and consults with them. The budget committees might sometimes say, \u201cWhat do you think is the right thing to do?\u201d But in the end, the budget committee's blessed the direction. How to Predict the Future Santi Ruiz \u00b7 November 8, 2023 Read full story He\u2019s a big advocate of internal prediction markets as a way to improve the intelligence community's forecasting. Has that idea ever crossed your desk? No. CBO has a great track record of internal accountability. And I just want to say right now what any CBO director would tell you if they were sitting where I am. We owe all of this to Alice Rivlin and Bob Reischauer , who started CBO and set it on such a good course that, essentially, we're all still doing what they did. And the staff is the key to that. The nonpartisan professionalism is in the DNA. No director can mess with it. And among the things they did was to say, \u201cAll right, we do a baseline. They do a bunch of legislation. We then need a new baseline. Let's go back and look and see how accurate we were. How good were the scores? How good was our baseline? What do we need to change? Who really missed it? Who on this staff, and why?\u201d That's what sharpens the reliability of the scores, the internal review process that really is supposed to be occupying the time between October 1st and January 1st. When you start a new cycle, Congress is supposed to be done. Now, they've blown that up in recent years, but that process still goes on. There are internal reviews of every single budgetary account, and every account is owned by an analyst, and the analyst is quizzed on \u201cWhy were you doing this and why did we end up there?\u201d That's one of the things that no one can see, but about which CBO should be quite proud. Is that your read of the early years of CBO? Certainly, yes. There was not agreement on what CBO should be, and Alice made great choices about what it should be and how it should behave. Alice decided, even though it's not in the law, that it would be nonpartisan, not bipartisan. You don't give each side 50%. You call shots correctly to the best of your ability. She's the one who said CBO should refrain from making policy recommendations. You work for the Congress, you take their proposals and you analyze them. And she, first and foremost, decided that CBO should have its independent economic forecast. Particularly during the Reagan years, CBO criticized Republicans. It then blew up the Clinton health plan. It has, over time, drawn the ire of everybody. And I was quite sensitive to this because I was the first and only CBO director to come directly from the White House. I had been working at the Council of Economic Advisors. Most Democrats on the Hill had no idea who I was, other than a Republican hack from the White House, and they thought CBO was deeply endangered by my presence. We had to just, again, prove our independence and nonpartisanship through the quality of the work. That's the only thing you can do. A little bit. But Alice was a great believer in the protection you were afforded by the facts. And she believed she had the facts on her side every time she said something because they'd done their work. And that's the risk she took. This has changed a little bit over time, and I'll come back to that. By and large, in my experience, people only came to CBO to lobby. They came in with a point of view, and it was not the one CBO had chosen as its estimate or its reading of the situation based on the research that was out there. So the null was, they were wrong. We'd already made a decision based on the facts and they were coming in to tell us something else. And it's because they were lobbying. They wanted to really move CBO, so I was quite skeptical. Now, the thing that was true then but has changed a little bit now is that we were always happy to have people provide us with information. If you know something, please bring that information to us. And do it well before the legislation is on the floor getting voted on. Because if you show up when it's getting voted on, you're there to lobby and get the outcome. But if you came in the January before and said, \u201cLook, you're about to do work on a prescription drug work program: We're a drug development company. This is our pipeline. This is what we'll have in the way of branded drugs. These are the generic substitutions we see.\u201d That's huge information for us. We had all of that. Companies gave that to us. We signed nondisclosure agreements so that their research was secure. It informed the drug benefit estimates enormously, to say the least. So that was always welcome. Showing up to complain about the outcome was not. And what I've seen Phil Swagel , the current director, do is announce requests for inf"

They were some of our most popular interviews yet. Lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan Santi Ruiz \u00b7 April 3, 2024 Read full story This month, we\u2019re running another series, this time on Congress. Specifically, we\u2019re focusing on Congress\u2019s support agencies , the bodies that exist to make Congress smarter, faster, and more effective at its job (theoretically). We\u2019ll be breaking down how they work, what people get wrong about them, and how Congress can help them to better help itself. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) The Government Accountability Agency (GAO) The (now-defunct) Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) Today\u2019s interviewee, Kevin Kosar , spent more than a decade at the CRS as a research manager and analyst. He\u2019s also been a think tank executive and is the author of Whiskey: A Global History . These days, he\u2019s a Resident Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , where his work focuses on Congressional reform (and he edits the invaluable website UnderstandingCongress.org ). Why Congress needs CRS Why congressmen don\u2019t know how Congress works How committee power has atrophied Why constituents are a problem For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: \u201cWhat is it not researching?\u201d might be a smartalecky but accurate response. Thomas Jefferson, in arguing for the creation of a library of Congress, said, to paraphrase, \u201cthere's virtually no subject which a legislator may not need to reference and consider,\u201d and that holds true. The Congressional Research Service gets questions on absolutely everything. Accordingly, it\u2019s divided by issue area: the government and finance division, the domestic and social policy division, the foreign affairs, defense and trade division, and so forth. One very important thing that CRS does is teach legislators how to be a legislator. Budget process is pretty complex, so they teach classes on budget process to new members of Congress and staff. They also teach courses on legislative process generally. Whether you're in the House or the Senate, you can't be very effective unless you know the rules of the chambers, which are fantastically abstruse. Very frequently, the rules on paper do not match the rules of how things run on a day-to-day basis. CRS wonks will also give you one-on-one consultations about particular moments. Say you're on a committee. You think that the committee is going to be swapping in a manager's amendment to replace the current bill. What's your authority as a junior member to try to offer an amendment to alter that bill? They can coach you on all that sort of stuff. Hardly anybody knows that. But it's really important. Most frequently, you the legislator would delegate the issue to one of your staff, according to how important it is to you and how fast you want a response. If it\u2019s super important, then you would give it to your staff director or your policy director and have them go to CRS and ask, or if it's less important, you might kick it down to a legislative correspondent or legislative assistant. Certainly, you are free to call CRS up. If you want to pick up the phone, shoot an email, or just lope over to the Madison building and knock on somebody\u2019s door, you can. Yes. By statutory direction, CRS has to respond to individual members and committees. Meanwhile, GAO only initiates their studies by direction of a statute or a request from a chairman of a committee. The Congressional Budget Office primarily works for the budget committees in each chamber. They'll take calls from a member, but neither they nor GAO are structured to provide that sort of customer service. CRS has 600 employees, all of whom understand that their agency is titled the Congressional Research Service . Yeah, although I guess the question is, who is a customer? Ostensibly the member of Congress is, but Congress employs thousands of staff who are also customers. And the staff are frequently responding to the public. You're a citizen, and you read something in the newspaper about some agricultural subsidy that's ending up in the pockets of some corporation, and you get aggrieved and you write to your member of Congress. The Congressional staffer who gets that letter, unless they happen to know that issue, is going to turn to the Congressional Research Service and ask, \u201cWhat is this constituent talking about and how do I respond?\u201d With each member of the House of Representatives having about 750,000 constituents, there are a lot of customers for CRS to respond to. There's a lot of overlap. Certainly CRS has a lot of people who have advanced academic training. However, it's very different from academia insofar as your research agenda has to be clearly germane to Congress. You do not, for example, have the liberty to earn a salary at CRS and go back and do research on early committee debates in the 2nd Congress in the 1790s, unless it is somehow immediately tied to some pending issue before Congress. Academics can do pretty much whatever they want. Additionally, your research agenda is largely reactive as opposed to proactive. Sometimes you are getting hundreds of requests per year from Congress, and you are responding to what they care about. You should also be spending your time anticipating what they might care about. Another difference is how you write. Academics tend to write for other academics. You go through a peer review process. The journals that you write for, that are so important in academia, are read by other people with advanced training. Not so for your audience in Congress. Anything that\u2019s particularly technical, you have to kick to an appendix in the back. You have got to have clarity of communication. Also, whereas academics have to struggle for tenure over about a five-year period, at CRS, after one successful year of employment as a civil servant, you are effectively tenured for life (absent malfeasance or terrible misbehavior). What did you mean by that phrase? It was the 21st century, but in many ways the day-to-day operations felt like they were in the 1990s. For example, the way the divisions were carved into various subject areas hadn't been changed since the \u201890s. Everybody treated it like a fixed feature of the agency, which it\u2019s not. There were various internal processes \u2014 paperwork and so on \u2014 that were so out of step with the current era. Oh, goodness. Trying to go to, say, a professional conference required filling out an unbelievable amount of paperwork. Over the years, additional paperwork requirements had been layered on and on. It was absolutely exhausting. Somebody being caught doing something bad or wasting money in some way. If a scandal at some other agency somewhere erupts and is reported in a newspaper or an inspector general report, government agencies will often think, \u201cWe better make sure that never happens here.\u201d So they create a new rule and some new forms. Our travel process at CRS actually got even more onerous while I was there, which seems almost impossible. It was because of a scandal at the General Services Administration, where they had used government money to hire a magician for a conference they did in Las Vegas. Yeah, and somehow it got out and CRS of course got anxious and created new rules. Another thing was the review process when an analyst at CRS writes a report or a memo. It badly needed restructuring, but nobody wanted to do it because that\u2019s the way they\u2019ve been doing it forever. Presumably, it should involve professional editors at all levels, all the way to the end of copy editing. But in fact, if you are an analyst at CRS, the first person who will look at your work is your section head. The section head is usually not an editor by training; they\u2019re an academic by training. Then it\u2019s division-level review, and they\u2019re not editors either. They\u2019re also academics. Then it goes down to agency-level review, where it is reviewed by people who have some editorial skill but are primarily reading to ensure that nothing you wrote is going to have any adverse effects on the agency. Finally, if there\u2019s time, it\u2019ll go to the publishing department where there are actual copy editors. CRS is basically a consulting and publishing firm. No other publishing firm I know of has an editorial process like that, where so few of the people in the review process have actual editorial training. I would say the vast majority is internal culture. I don't think the agency feels a lot of market competition, unlike a private firm that might say, \u201cHey, we have to get past some of this dowdiness to stay nimble and stay in business.\u201d In fact, there is market competition, but it's not well recognized inside the agency, so people get very comfortable doing things certain ways. There's not a lot of exogenous pressure to change. Habits form and they\u2019re difficult to overcome. To work in a place like CRS, you have to be a person who likes to follow rules, and that's a noble characteristic, but it can also lead to the sort of \u201cdowdiness\u201d that becomes a little hostile to innovation. Let's think back to before there was an internet. If you\u2019re a congressional staffer or member of Congress and you are trying to figure out what the devil you can do when a bill is brought up in Congress \u2014 Do I have an opportunity to amend it? \u2014 How do you get that answer? Before the internet, you would walk over to CRS. You would go into the second floor room where CRS reports were stacked, and you would just pick the ones that addressed your needs, or you would call one of their legislative procedure experts. There were other sources of expertise in society then, but they were locked up in academia where you couldn't get to them and you wouldn't even know where to look, or they might be in lobbying shops. You had limited access to the information you needed. CRS was a monopoly provider. Fast forward to today, you're a member of Congress and you want to know something about the motion to vacate the Speaker. You can find people who know legislative procedure really well on Twitter. You can find people who know all sorts of stuff about congressional history and other relevant issues writing for The Dispatch and all sorts of publications out there. There is all this outside competition from media, from think tanks, from 501(c)(4)s , and from all sorts of organizations that have a lot of smart people producing highly intelligent, researched content. So CRS is no longer a monopolist. With ChatGPT and those sorts of engines arising, basic stuff like when Social Security was created and what the arguments were for doing it, that\u2019s out there now. You don\u2019t have to go to CRS for that. There\u2019s competition now. Yeah, think tanks have always competed with CRS \u2014 Brookings was first created a century ago \u2014 but they started really rising in prominence and size in the 1970s. But whenever we speak of think tanks, almost inevitably comes the association that this one leans left or this one leans right. CRS\u2019s special sauce is that they don\u2019t lean left or right. They are civil servants straight down the middle and they\u2019re deathly afraid of being accused of leaning left or right, whereas with think tanks, that\u2019s often part of the identity. Yes, think tanks produce stuff that people on Capitol Hill want and learn from. But they\u2019re not going to knock CRS off its perch. They certainly don\u2019t have the budget to employ 600+ people like CRS. It\u2019s got some core strengths, one of which is confidentiality. You, a staffer, a member, go to them and you don\u2019t even have to think twice about your conversation or request to them ever seeing the light of day. In a town that's obsessed with leaking and terrified by it, that's a big deal. CRS also does customized work. So you're a staffer and you're trying to get ready for a hearing. You need to write a memo to brief your member of Congress but you don\u2019t know where to start. You ask CRS to write you a confidential memo that comes up with some background information on the issue and some suggested questions to use for the hearing. You\u2019re not going to find think tanks offering that typically, but CRS does. CRS also has the ability to cobble together diverse expertise very quickly to tackle issues. If you want a briefing on AI, okay. CRS can probably have a technology person who could talk about that. They can also bring in somebody who knows copyright or some other germane issue and bring that in. They can also bring in somebody who knows public administration, in case you want to talk about how AI can be used in the course of the regulatory process. They can throw that team together and have them over in your office the same day, potentially. Again: not easy for think tanks and other outside outfits to do that sort of stuff. The last thing is institutional memory. By hiring people as civil servants and giving them tenure for life, they have people there who can tell you what happened on this issue 10, 20 or 30 years ago. They also have files and old reports that can be mined. Who else has that? No, CRS does not have investigative authority. Now, they can reach out to a congressional committee and say, \u201cHey, we\u2019re working on this topic within your jurisdiction, can you place a request so that it comes from you but the information is ultimately delivered to CRS?\u201d They can and do get information that way. But unlike GAO or an inspector general, CRS people can\u2019t just go to an agency and say, \u201chand over those files.\u201d As a CRS analyst, you\u2019re always going hat in hand to the agency. The best CRS analysts are those who develop trust-based relationships with the agencies they study, so that they can get that stuff and turn it into an even-handed research product that makes sense. Yeah, the CRS is right now in the process of searching for a new director, and that's something I've had some input on. It needs to find somebody who is very aware of the fact that the working environment around CRS is changing. It needs somebody who could see that, focus tightly on the core competencies they have that make them utterly invaluable to Congress, and let go of certain other things that are no longer worth doing. This director would also have to be a very good people person. In order to make changes, not only do you have to create the internal support for employees to come along, you need to go to the committees of jurisdiction: the appropriators who put directive language on the money they give to the legislative branch, and get them all on the same page about what you are trying to achieve. Historically, the CRS has struggled with adopting new technology. I was in the Madison building just last week and hit a massive telephone dead spot. I had no Gs. For an organization devoted to customer service where everyone carries a cell phone 24 hours a day, your own headquarters having dead spots is nuts. They\u2019ve got a lot of technology issues. They need someone who\u2019s really good at government IT acquisition, implementation working at the very top echelon of the agency and fixing this stuff. Because it drives workers crazy. Certainly the review process I described earlier needs to be fixed, so that more of the people who are engaged in editing are adding more value at each stage. The second thing would be to accelerate the knowledge management improvements they're making. I referenced all that historical memory. There\u2019s still a ton of stuff on paper in filing cabinets. Digitizing and organizing that information and making it more usable \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of value that needs to be tapped. Rearranging the divisions would be another. One of the curiosities of the CRS is that it\u2019s got a division called the American Law Division, and it\u2019s full of lawyers, but all these lawyers work on legal aspects of topics that are worked on by other divisions. It often creates difficult situations where, when a member of Congress wants information on something, you send it to the policy expert and you send it to the legal expert. Why not take the lawyers and embed them in the research division so we can respond more quickly to Congress? There\u2019s a lot that can be done to strengthen the place and get it in a better position to succeed in the 21st century. CRS was created in the early seventies out of the old Legislative Reference Service , which was mostly reference librarians with some experts sprinkled in. And Congress said, we need a full-blown think tank that primarily works for the committees. They wanted them to work on creating an oversight agenda. They wanted CRS staff and experts to come and work at the committees. Don't show up in the Madison building, show up in Rayburn or wherever the committee is at, and be with them for long stretches. That was the conception. Fast forward to today, committees are a lot weaker in the congressional process and individual members are much more like individual entrepreneurs running their own policy and politics shop. They\u2019re less dependent on the parties as such. The individual members of Congress are now flooding CRS with requests. Frequently it's constituent-driven questions coming in the mail and through email. That leads to a lot of CRS experts spending time focusing on smaller reference-type issues, rather than deep diving into research. It\u2019s also the case that there are a lot of show horses in Congress now who are not really interested in research. If you have fewer people who are serious about finding the answer to difficult policy questions, they\u2019re going to ask fewer serious questions of CRS, and CRS employees are going to have less intellectual stuff to do. Yeah. And, again, usually it's tethered towards more parochial matters. You're not getting a whole lot of individual members going to CRS to try to learn up on a specific topic and then use that to try to roll leadership on it. That happens, yeah, but not as much. Another pressure on CRS is the polarization and the intense partisan competition for maintaining or winning a majority in the chamber has led to legislators being obsessed with the narrative and messaging. CRS has frequently borne the brunt of denunciations from the very people they\u2019re trying to help because CRS did a calculation or wrote a report that had inconvenient facts. Those facts get picked up by the media or someone outside Congress who then says, \u201cCongress is saying it wants to do this, but CRS is saying that\u2019s not the best way to achieve this.\u201d Oh, controversy. Then, of course, CRS gets kicked around and members of Congress denounce it, and the individual analysts and the agency heads can\u2019t fight back. They just have to take the punishment. It\u2019s not fair. I would say getting everybody up to speed on legislative and budget process would be very important because you need to understand the flow of business: when things are happening and how things get done. You can't play chess if you don't know the moves. The second thing would be to figure out, if you don\u2019t already know, the top issues for your home state or district and then go to CRS and get close to the experts in those areas and get really schooled on them. Next, depending on what your committee\u2019s jurisdiction is, go to CRS and learn those subjects and also learn committee procedure so you don\u2019t make a fool of yourself. That would be the starting advice. Ultimately, what you want is to find people at CRS who you can develop a long-term relationship with so you can call them or have them come over and get handed confidential advice. If they feel comfortable with you and you feel comfortable with them, that\u2019s invaluable. Absolutely. I follow a lot of procedure people on Twitter and with great regularity they will post a C-SPAN clip where some member tries to do something and is getting the legislative procedure wrong, and one of the parliamentarians or a support person has to tell them they can\u2019t do it.

    "keywords": "At Statecraft , we\u2019re interested in what happens to policies after they get passed as a bill, executive order, or regulation. Take the failure of healthcare.gov, or America\u2019s broken environmental review process, or decades-long waiting lists at Veterans Affairs. As today\u2019s guest understands, sometimes policymaking isn\u2019t done when the policy is made; often, it\u2019s just getting started. Jen Pahlka has been obsessed with policy implementation for a long time. She founded Code for America (modeled on the Peace Corp and Teach for America), served as the Deputy Chief Technology Officer for the Obama administration, helped found the United States Digital Service , an elite federal government tech unit, and co-founded US Digital Response in 2020. These days, she\u2019s a Senior Fellow at the Niskanen Center and the Federation of American Scientists. I was joined by my IFP colleague Alec Stapp to interview Pahlka (Alec wrote a great review of Pahlka\u2019s new book, Recoding America: Why Government Is Failing in the Digital Age and How We Can Do Better ). What the IRS is doing right Whether Schedule F can fix civil service Why federal contractors fail Why it takes nine months to hire in the federal government For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: Eight lucky people, and many hundreds of thousands of unlucky ones. You had a congressionally mandated deadline and a very big task. And you had an agency that pretty much had to use one of the vendors already on contract, because the procurement process can take a really long time and they only had two or three years. So you already had a set of actors, including CMS itself [ Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ] and the vendor and others, who were operating in a government technology mode, not a consumer technology mode. There's not that much that CMS builds that's actually citizen-facing, and certainly not that quickly. This was something that had to serve millions of people. Lots of people have had their say about what went wrong, and they\u2019re largely right, but the thing they don\u2019t say is that healthcare.gov didn't have a product manager, in the tech-world sense of that term. The distinction between a project manager and a product manager is that a project manager gets stuff done, but a product manager decides what to do in the first place. We have these assumptions in government that there's no choices to be made. This is the policy, these are the requirements derived from that policy and other policies from domains like cybersecurity, for example. And you just implement them. It's a process of checking off a lot of boxes. When we make good consumer software, we set priorities. We try to really understand what people want, and we don't try to do everything at once. The people fundamentally in charge believe that's the only way to do it, despite the fact that you had great people in the system saying, \u201cWhat if we had a staged rollout? What if we only served this kind of customer from the beginning and added the others?\u201d If the site had launched to a limited population, it's not that others wouldn't have been able to sign up for health care. They would have gone through the call centers and the in-person service centers that were designed to handle people with complex edge cases. But the CMS team was told that wasn't possible. And so they tried to do every single possible edge case from day one. When you try to do that, to serve everyone from the beginning, you serve no one. Contrast that with the IRS\u2019s Direct File . That's serving a very small portion of the population [ 141,000 successfully submitted tax returns ], learning what works, working out the bugs, seeing what people like and what they don't, where they get confused. That means they can make it better by the time that they bring the next tranche of users on. And it\u2019s working! This is actually the way that good software gets built iteratively, by adding people and use cases over time. We've come so far from healthcare.gov, but I've taken several calls from journalists who want to know why the IRS is doing Direct File this way. They're like, \u201cIt seems terrible that they would serve so few people.\u201d And I just point out, did you try to sign up for Bluesky? You went on a waiting list, and they added you when they were ready. Did Yelp start out serving every single city? No, they started in San Francisco, and then they added New York and then LA, as they got it better over time. And what they're able to do is the opposite of that quote from Clay Shirky : \u201cThe waterfall method amounts to a pledge by all parties not to learn anything while doing the actual work.\u201d Not learning anything while doing the work is what the healthcare.gov team were forced to do, and you saw the results of it. Now you've got a Direct File team able to learn and improve as it goes. So by the time the rest of us get invited to use Direct File, it will be far better. It's two styles of building software. Waterfall essentially says you have these distinct phases: gathering requirements, designing it, building it, testing it. And it's a sin in waterfall to go back. Once you've built your requirements, never change them. Once you've done your design, don't change it. Agile, that is all the opposite. You're in a build, measure, learn cycle over and over again. You build something, if it works, you learn from it, you build more. In a waterfall paradigm, the software never touches users until the very end, in what\u2019s called user acceptance testing. That's very different from agile, in which you are working with users from the very beginning. It is. And it's very different from the mantra, \u201cunderstand user needs and meet user needs.\u201d You have to be working with users all the way up through your development to achieve that. In the book, I use this dichotomy as a metaphor. Our entire system of government is built as a waterfall, especially when you have to think about implementation of the policy. At the very top, you have whatever legislative body writes the law. It gets handed off to agencies who write regulations based on the law and policy, and it descends all the way down to the people who create the interfaces that administer that law. In the case of the ACA, that was healthcare.gov. In the case of the IRS, it's now Direct File or your regular tax forms. Those people are at the very bottom of the waterfall. If learning only goes one way, the people who are actually interacting with the users of the system have no way to tell the people who wrote the law what's working and what isn't. And we continue not to learn. Are these issues bigger problems with progressives who value equality and inclusion, and think that on day one, a new government service should be available to 100% of people? Or is this an issue inherent to government, even when Republicans are in charge? I think that there has been a misinterpretation of the progressive value of equity to mean that staged rollouts would harm folks, because there some people wouldn't be able to use it. And, to be honest, in the case of healthcare.gov, it's true. For instance, there was a small segment of immigrants who were eligible for healthcare under the ACA. And it's very hard to code software for those far-out edge cases and get it right from the beginning. So it does feel sometimes like you are disadvantaging the least advantaged. You're failing to serve the most vulnerable. But the reality is, if you don't do a stage rollout, you're very often going to serve no one at all . Certainly the ACA was extremely politicized, but the people who built it were neither Republicans or Democrats. They're bureaucrats. It\u2019s less the left or right creating this environment, and more what Ezra Klein has called \u201ccramped, small, professionalized thinking.\u201d It\u2019s very lawyerly, but it\u2019s not always lawyers who act this way, and not all lawyers act this way. \u201cI'm interpreting these pieces of law and policy and regulation in the most rigid, persnickety way and trying to get exactly the thing that we think the law says, rather than what the law intended.\u201d There's a real divide between those people who are constantly looking at the letter of the law and those who are returning to the intent of the law, trying to have flexibility and judgment, and create space for design in the implementation of law. Klein has argued that this lawyerly approach is more associated with the left, and that may be true, but in a bureaucratic context, you don't even know if the person's on the left or the right. You just know that they're saying, \u201cA staged rollout is illegal because I'm interpreting this equity statute that way.\u201d Larry Kramer has this notion that the law is supposed to be interpreted by normal people, in a book called The People Themselves: Popular Constitutionalism and Judicial Review . He argues there's a real history in the U.S. of saying the law must make sense to normal people, not just lawyers and judges. I talk in my book about this woman, Natalie Kates, on a project at CMS, trying to fight the policy team. The policy team is saying, \u201cThere are nine different definitions of a medical group, and we\u2019re going to make doctors read through these nine different definitions as they start the process of complying with the new quality payment program.\u201d And Natalie says, \u201cWe can't do that. There's enough in common in these definitions that we can resolve them down. We're not burdening doctors with that.\u201d She doesn't get all the way to one definition, but she does get to two, which makes it a lot easier. What she's saying is, I get that it's complicated, but it has to make sense to a person. People with specialized knowledge, whether it be law or policy or whatever \u2014 and you meet a lot of people like that in government \u2014 are good people, and they're trying to do the right thing, but what they don't realize is they're so attached to that specialized knowledge, which they feel gives them value and status, that they're missing the forest for the trees. And Natalie's right. It has to make sense to a person. There\u2019s roots of that in American history and culture that we need to tap back into. I think that's the way out of this small, cramped, professionalized thinking, where you're just so proud of all nine definitions, instead of saying, \u201cNo. We can't have nine definitions.\u201d Or, in the case of a program at Medicaid, Congress has exempted doctors who take very few Medicare patients from a particular rollout. The people trying to deliver in a way that makes sense say, \u201cGreat, let's exempt them based on last year's data.\u201d But people with small, professionalized, cramped thinking say, \u201cThe most accurate way to do what Congress said is to make everybody go through the program the first year, then see who's under the threshold, and then exempt them.\u201d But making everyone go through a program is extremely burdensome and it actually drives people away from the program. That's the big divide, between lawyerly thinking and user-centered thinking. Is this because if you were to survey the personalities and political ideologies of students in law school, they tend to lean a lot more progressive, and then they want to do big things with government, and we now have a lot more lawyers in government relative to other types of professionals? Or does causality run in the other direction? U.S. institutions are highly litigious, and the government needs a lot of lawyers to defend against litigation. So it draws more lawyers into government at the expense of other types. I really don't know. I do observe that the successes of the progressive left, say the civil rights movement, have all come through laws that were then strictly enforced. There's just a belief that law is the way progress happens. I believe that, but I also believe that the delivery end is where this happens, actually giving people what they need and expect from government. That involves a different mindset. Progressives have too much faith, sometimes, in the power of law. I would encourage them to think about the power of actually delivering what the people need, which sometimes involves being a little bit flexible with the law. But before reading it, I might have thought that large contracting firms can hire a lot of product managers, they can pay them market salaries to produce good software and meet deliverables. To me it's not an in-house or out-of-house thing. The terms are set by what the government decides to contract for. Teams learn how to contract for a product instead of a project. But once the government puts out a Request For Proposal [ RFP ] with 6,700 requirements \u2014 and that's not a made-up number, that's a big state software project \u2014 you're already in a death march of fulfilling requirements without any prioritization or understanding of user needs. A great contractor with fantastic product managers is not going to succeed, even with the right staff, because the project\u2019s success has been defined as a process of checking off requirements. And there's never a requirement that the software actually work for the people who use it. That's just too vague. But if you put out an RFP that is structured differently, with a different definition of success, then yes, a contractor can come in and say, \u201cWe've got exactly the right product manager for this, here's where we're going to deliver it.\u201d Even then, though, they have to rely on there being product ownership on the inside. A government software project can\u2019t succeed if you don't have a very involved partner on the inside resolving ambiguities in the policy with you. In a traditional, legacy development framework, the government essentially abdicates responsibility for the outcome to the vendor. When it doesn't work, it's not our fault: it's the vendor\u2019s fault. And even those vendors who are used to working in this requirements-heavy, death march style will say, \u201cIt's actually impossible to do this because there's no one helping us make product decisions.\u201d Contractors should not be interpreting regulations without somebody from the government sitting by their side, because they're essentially making policy decisions, which should be done by public servants. Even the contractors that I consider less helpful in the ecosystem would love to see changes like that. But the contractors offering fantastic services don't just want those changes, they require them. In a world where the system changes, do some of them see a clear path towards a win where they deliver better services and it's also better business? Are they reading your book and getting excited? Some of them. Look, there's always a difference between people in companies and companies themselves. It's hard to find somebody who works for one of the big Beltway bandits who wouldn't complain about the same problems. Here\u2019s a good name: Nava PBC . It's a contractor that works with CMS and a lot of states, very good at product management, and they deliver excellent user-centered products. They\u2019re the kind of contractor that requires that product ownership by their government partners. A Beltway bandit employee will complain about the same thing because, on a personal level, they want to deliver good product. But as a company, they may not be as eager to see change in the ecosystem, because they definitely benefit from the system. I believe that there is plenty of work. And if we went to a product model more frequently in government, you would see smaller contracts go out, but more of them, and you would have a greater variety of contractors, which is really good for the system. But those big Beltway bandits would still have a lot of projects. They just might have more smaller ones. There'll be plenty to go around, but I'm not sure they necessarily can get their heads around that and really advocate for the changes that need to happen to get there because they do benefit from the status quo. I have to start with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services because there were some wonderful people there who were kind enough to let me feature them. In particular, Yadira Sanchez. You can see the shock from healthcare.gov that caused the change, and you can see the ways that folks like Yadira shifted practices. When they delivered their next product after healthcare.gov, the quality payment program, it was a huge success: on time, under budget. People were calling the call center, not to complain, but to say, \u201cThis is so easy, I must be on the wrong website?\u201d I should also shout out the VA [ Veterans Affairs ], which is going to surprise some people, because there are things still very wrong with the VA \u2014 and frankly, there's still things going wrong at CMS. But in 2013, Marina Nitze was recruited to be the first CTO there, and the transformation that she kicked off has been profound. [ We interviewed Nitze for Statecraft: How to Salvage the VA . ] And then Charles Worthington ended up succeeding her at VA, and has been there for I think 10 years now, which shows the power of people sticking around to see change through. Yadira Sanchez has been at CMS for 24 years now. The VA used to be one backlog after another. Marina and the team start by fixing this veterans healthcare application and showing that there's a different way of doing this. They brought a video of a veteran trying to use the legacy healthcare application to the deputy secretary and they made him watch how hard it was for a user. And that's the beginning of a culture shift, which says, It doesn't matter if all the boxes were checked, if they can't use it, it's not finished, it's not done. Fast forward to COVID, the VA was texting veterans saying, \u201cClick this link to schedule your vaccine.\u201d It was three clicks and they had a vaccine appointment. It isn't perfect, but they now are delivering services to veterans that are world class. That's an enormous transformation, but it has taken quite a while. It\u2019s taken people like Charles showing up, sticking around, and making sure the agency doesn\u2019t backslide when it makes progress. Or is she someone who changed over time, and learned a new set of ideas? I guess my question is whether we mostly need to empower existing people, or help well-intentioned folks do a complete 180? I think it's a combination, but the biggest thing we could do right now is find and empower Yadiras. They're there. She didn't have the language for agile development until she worked with the healthcare.gov team, but it's not like she was a tabula rasa . She's incredibly creative and mission-driven, and was doing fantastic work before healthcare.gov I think there's been this thesis that the way to make government better is to bring people in from the outside. It's important to bring people in. I value that. But it\u2019s a big mistake to hold them up as saviors, when we should really be investing in and empowering the strong leaders we have today, giving them exposure to ways of working that legacy frameworks just don't allow for. We have great people in government; we need to unlock their potential. Empowerment isn't just the knowledge; it's also the will. When our public servants are standing up for the user, they need to be able to win. And so much of our government is constructed to fight against them. What do you think of that? For people who are skeptical of the Schedule F approach, what\u2019s the alternative agenda? I think Schedule F is dangerous, because civil service protections are important, and there can be a disregard for what public servants do. But I also think the status quo is intolerable. We need to make it easier to hire better based on real assessments of people, better support, better training, and also easier to fire. The left doesn't like to talk about that, but I absolutely believe that is important. And it can be done without significant congressional action. It can be done by setting a different tone from the top about what's important. It's less important to check every box and make sure that "

    "keywords": "An announcement: tomorrow (Thursday April 25th), we\u2019ll be hosting the first live Statecraft interview . We\u2019re talking to economist Chris Snyder about his role in developing the pilot \u201cAdvanced Market Commitment,\u201d or AMC, for pneumococcal vaccines for low-income countries. The AMC led to the development of three vaccines, the immunization of more than 150 million children, and an estimated 700,000 lives saved. It was also a key inspiration for Operation Warp Speed. We\u2019ll be taking listener questions: sign up below . In 1944, Congress authorized $800 million for the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb. In today\u2019s dollars, that would be roughly $12 billion. But Congress didn\u2019t realize it was funding the bomb at all: the money was hidden in an innocuous clause, hidden from all but eight legislators. Early this year, New York Times Congress reporter Catie Edmondson described her obsessive attempts to find out how this was possible. How could such a massive, world-changing project be hidden from the people funding it? Today, we talk to Catie about Congress, then and now. Is it harder to keep secrets on today\u2019s Hill? How common is the use of the \u201cblack budget?\u201d Can Congressional leadership stop backbenchers from talking to reporters? For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: I'll start with one big similarity, which was one of the driving forces behind wanting to do this story in the first place. A lot of members now complain about how top-down and leadership-driven legislation is, the idea being that in the past lawmakers, committees or committee chairs in particular, had much more power to cut deals that brought legislation to the floor. When you talk to lawmakers who are leaving Congress, that's often one of their major complaints. They feel they've been shut out of the actual legislative process. That\u2019s true empirically, I think, but one important through line between the Congress that I was looking at with Speaker Sam Rayburn (D-TX) and the current Congress is that this gambit to pass this $800 million dollars secretly was entirely a leadership-driven exploit. Only a handful of lawmakers were brought into the loop on it. When I saw Oppenheimer , I was really interested in the fact that only seven or eight lawmakers in the entire Congress knew about it. The other anecdote in the story that I get asked a lot about now was one Speaker Rayburn told a historian . He saw one of the seven members who had been briefed on this talking to a reporter. He sees the congressman clock, \u201cOh, there's Speaker Rayburn.\u201d He sees this face of guilt immediately pop up on the congressman, and Rayburn pulls aside the reporter who apparently has been told this secret about the $800 million that they're smuggling. Rayburn tells him, \u201cIf you're a good American, you're not going to write about this,\u201d and the reporter doesn't. It ends up being fine. I got asked a lot, by both people on the Hill and other journalists, whether or not I think that could happen today, if a reporter would be confronted by the Speaker and basically swallow this secret. I heard a lot of people on the Hill saying that they didn't think anything like this could happen because of the way media incentives work. They thought even a lawmaker briefed on it would want to rush out and get the media attention, or, in a more virtuous lens, tell people about this. The connotation I got from people on the Hill was more negative, that they would want to use this as an opportunity to grab the spotlight. I don't know. Put yourself in that reporter's shoes and imagine one congressman has told you some scandalous information, but the Speaker of the House, immediately comes up to you and says shut up about it. Even if you wanted to defy the Speaker, are you going to run a single-source story in wartime saying that the United States is coming up with this top secret weapon? Also, the press was subject to far more censorship during wartime from the government than anything we would imagine today. I do think it is a simplified story. From a journalistic ethics standpoint, it would be a huge debate. The way that Congress is structured right now, a big secret like this probably would not be widely shared with most members, right? I always joke that I don't love staking out House member briefings because \u201cHere's Afghanistan on a map\u201d is the level of detail I'm expecting out of those briefings. So it becomes a question of if you think some of the very senior lawmakers on these committees \u2013 Intel, Armed Services \u2013 do you think they would start to leak it out? When you start thinking about just how winnowed down the groups that this information would reach actually are, then it does become a much trickier calculus. Of course, some blabbermouth attention-seeking congressman could leak this out. My personal view is that once these lawmakers get to these very sought-after committees and they have seniority on them, they tend to keep things closer to the chest. I wonder if you see parallels in more partisan questions, that there is still pressure not to run certain stories in the interest of the country. You're talking about a self-censoring instinct? I tend to think that most reporters can't really help themselves once they've found out exclusive or pressing information. There's always a calculus as to what we think is newsworthy to publish, right? I don't want to write that off entirely. But when it comes to this particular discussion about the ways in which secretive information is shared on the Hill, the way that I thought about it was more from the perspective of the decision-makers in the room choosing to share information and how it trickles out through there rather than what we as reporters choose to report. I remember lawmakers being very angry coming out of the briefings on the Soleimani strikes back in 2020. They felt like they had not been given sufficient information and that they were getting patted on the head by the Department of Defense (DoD) officials who were briefing them. I remember Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), for example, storming out and just spilling straight to the C-SPAN cameras, \u201cThis is what they told us, these are the questions that I asked, and these were their answers.\u201d He wasn't sharing classified information, but he was giving us more of an overview than you generally get of how those briefings go, because he was so dissatisfied with it. Obviously when lawmakers feel they're not being told the whole story or the briefing they have received is insufficient, they are often inclined to share more about what they've heard. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) often comes out of briefings and says, \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me anything I didn\u2019t know.\u201d That\u2019s pretty much his line. But often what they choose to share is an effort to force more information their way, or it\u2019s politically motivated. I got a question during a previous interview about whether there was any debate along partisan lines around approving this money for the bomb. Typically, the people who are placed on these national security committees are not super partisan to begin with. There are a handful of exceptions, but generally they tend to be hawkish national security types. Sometimes, depending on the subject matter, depending on the president, you will certainly see those partisan lines emerge, but historically on those committees, you see less sniping along partisan lines. Do we know by what mechanism they were doing that, and what changed that made them say they needed formal appropriations? They would get a pot of money for the Army Corps of Engineers, for example, and then they would spend some of that money on whatever they needed at Los Alamos at the time. I don't know exactly the way that they were able to do that. By 1944, there was a lot of concern among Roosevelt administration officials, among DoD officials, that the United States was not moving fast enough in our pursuit of the bomb. There was concern that the Germans potentially were moving faster. They decided it was no longer sufficient to suction or siphon money from these pools where technically it was supposed to be going to other things. They went to Congress and asked them to appropriate money specifically for creating the atom bomb. Congress for Dummies: Congress has the power of the purse. They set the top-line number of how much the federal government is going to spend on the things that it decides it wants to spend money on, including the functioning of the government. They will also choose how much money to spend on each program. That is a power that is vested with a specific committee, one in the House, one in the Senate. Those are the appropriators. That is a very sought-after committee: who doesn\u2019t want to be the person who gets to say how the government's money is spent? Theoretically, they're supposed to pass twelve spending bills every year that govern how much each program gets to spend. It doesn't always work that way. In fact, recently, it has not worked that way, but that is how it is supposed to work. If someone comes along later and claims that Congress didn\u2019t appropriate that money, is the intent of that language that the folks in Los Alamos could point back at that clause: \u201cexpediting production\u201d? Is there a legal issue here with establishing the intent of Congress? Oh, interesting. I have no idea. That\u2019s also not something I am aware of having happened previously. I don't know if there's a precedent for people coming after the fact and saying that money was misappropriated. But one of the reasons I thought \u201cexpediting production\u201d was such a great phrase, it's just such good vague terminology. I would not have batted an eyelash if I was the reporter back in 1944 tasked with reading through this report to see what we were spending our money on. That\u2019s how these bills are written generally. This is what I do when they drop spending bills that are actually spending bills, not just stopgap bills that extend current levels of funding: I go through and I look for programs that sound interesting or off. It's not a science, it's very much vibes, right? It's reading the table of contents and thinking, \u201cOh, that sounds interesting. What exactly are they talking about when they say that?\u201d Congress, both then and now, does use these super broad terms to describe certain activities. It is really hard to understand exactly where that money is going sometimes. It is something that constantly nags at me as the reporter for our team in charge of doing this. I'm always wondering if I missed something. That\u2019s right. I get asked a lot if something like this could happen today, not just in terms of keeping it a secret, but also actually fitting it into the spending bills. It's a subject I'm trying to learn more about, but we do have black budgets, right? There are certain activities that the CIA does which are just not written into the budget. I don't know if there's anything to the level of creating an atomic bomb, but there certainly are activities nowadays that are just not in the spending bills, or they are hidden. Tim Weiner , a reporter who worked at the Times , did a lot of work on covering the black budget back in the day. He writes that the Air Force used a lot of its budget as a shell for these secretive activities. It illustrates that where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way for some of this stuff. It is actually Weiner\u2019s theory of the case in his book, Blank Check , that this 1944 \u201cexpediting production\u201d line item was the first iteration of the black budget. Of course, it was extremely narrow; it was for one specific thing. Then as we went into the Cold War, it just ballooned into hiding many different activities under many different line items. Or at least that this was the seed that started it all. Engel was a side character, but a great one. In some of the official records that the army kept, they kept referencing this guy, Albert Engel, a Republican from Michigan, and he was always on the DoD's back, asking about government waste at various military sites around the country. He was always showing up at military sites to do these ad hoc investigations himself. I read in the Elmer Thomas memoir later that he was self-funding these trips to military installations, and the way he realized something was happening at Oak Ridge was that he was not allowed to visit that military facility. He kept asking and was told repeatedly no, but they couldn\u2019t tell him why he wasn\u2019t allowed there. He finally wore them down enough that Roosevelt personally approved a field trip for Albert Engel and a handful of other congressmen to go visit Oak Ridge. I think that Roosevelt actually passed away before the trip happened, and then Truman had to approve their field trip, but they finally went down to Oak Ridge. Unfortunately there aren\u2019t any records that I could find of what Engel himself thought when he went there. Leslie Groves wrote that the congressmen were so impressed by what was happening at Oak Ridge that they actually asked if they needed any more money for the site. I've since found that you have to take certain things that Leslie Groves said at the time with a grain of salt. From a newspaper in 1938 \u2013 \u201cPutting fly in ointment of \u2018McNutt-for-president\u2019 boom. Washington, D.C., April 21. If he continues the pace he is setting to date, Rep. Albert J. Engel, Republican of Michigan, appears certain to throw the \u2018monkey wrench\u2019 into the gears of the \u2018McNutt-for-President\u2019 boom which got underway during the past winter. Rep. Engel is pictured studying plans he dug up for the two palaces, \u2018Summer\u2019 and \u2018Regular\u2019 which as high commissioner of the Philippines, McNutt wants built as Commissioner's residences in islands. The proposed palaces are to cost $500,000 and $250,000 respectively. Rep. Engel takes great pride in pointing out that plans for the palaces include 18 lavatories and bathrooms with a seating capacity of 43.\u201d Yes, and he wasn\u2019t the only one. Harry Truman, a senator at the time, also had some sort of panel that was looking into government waste and he had gotten suspicious about what was happening with these appropriations. The war secretary, Henry Stimson, basically said, \u201cTrust us on this one, Harry\u201d, only to have to tell him two years later. \u201cOh, Mr. President, about that thing you asked us about two years ago\u2026\u201d But those were the only instances I could find of people raising an eyebrow. I went back and looked at the congressional record for the floor debates, both in the House and the Senate, for when this military spending bill was passed, just to see if anyone raised any questions about what was in the bill or complained about the bill moving too quickly and they really did not. There was one senator who objected to the inclusion of some provision he thought was extraneous to military spending, but there wasn\u2019t a real debate about the contents of the bill. Yeah. I don't know. That was part of the ask that Stimson, the war secretary and the other government officials made to the appropriators and the Congressional leadership. They said, \u201cWe need you to hide this money and then we need you to tamp down any questions or discussion or debate about it.\u201d It\u2019s not clear to me whether there was any pre-hearing work that went into that, or if it truly just didn\u2019t catch anyone\u2019s eye. That description makes sense if you\u2019re reading it: of course we want to try to speed the flow of munitions to Europe. The other thing that was very frustrating for me was that the members of Congress who were involved in this gambit seem to have really labored to keep any word about this out of contemporaneous documents. One of the senators invited to the secret meeting was not even invited on a piece of paper. It's a phone call placed an hour before the meeting, and he's told, \u201cDon't even tell anyone on your staff where you're going.\u201d It\u2019s striking to me that research scientists like Vannevar Bush were so well regarded by the military, but legislators had never heard of him until the atomic bomb meetings. It\u2019s a good point. Also, they brought General Marshall to the House meeting. Stimson writes in his diary about how disappointed he was, almost gutted, that Marshall had some sort of obligation and couldn't come to the Senate meeting. In the House, it made such a big impression on lawmakers when they brought Marshall in to ask for the money. Part of that is just how these meetings on the Hill work, even today, but it did really make me think about these guys going in. \u201cTheatrics\u201d might be too strong of a word to use, but they were asking for a hefty sum of money, they were asking for it to be kept a secret, and they clearly were thinking about the visuals of the presentation and what impression they wanted to leave these lawmakers with. It does remind me of bringing Zelensky to the Hill, right? Every time there needs to be a new aid package, you bring in your best representative, someone who has the name, the popularity, or the recognition. One of the reasons why I was so happy to read this memoir from Elmer Thomas was I wanted to experience one of these meetings through the perspective of one of its members. In some of the tellings of the administration officials it was very clear that in these meetings with members of Congress, they were being super deferential. They were saying, \u201cOf course we must invite our equal co-branch of government into these discussions.\u201d Privately they were more like, \u201cWe need some money and I guess we have to tell the guys in Congress about it.\u201d Elmer Thomas was a senator so Marshall was not in the meeting with him, but even so he describes being absolutely floored at the magnitude of this secret. He writes that he had never even heard of the term \u201cfission\u201d or \u201cfusion\u201d before this meeting. The idea of being told we're creating this bomb that we're going to drop from a single plane that has tens of thousands times the power of TNT just put his jaw on the floor. I would, yes, and it is potentially worse or more performative now, because it's a great fundraising tool to say, \u201cPatriot, let me show you a video of me absolutely taking it to this bureaucrat, send $5 today.\u201d Excerpt from Speaker Rayburn interview with historian Forrest Pogue I want to go into the kind of archival work you were doing. You found the description in the report of the hearing, but you couldn\u2019t find a copy of the bill itself. Does it exist somewhere? After this story was published, a grad student in London emailed and found the bill for me. I was so thrilled to find it. I would like to improve my search skills, but typically you've got congress.gov for more recent bills. Something that was passed in the 1940 is very difficult to find. I was going into the congressional record a lot to try to pick up bill numbers and to see how this military establishment appropriations bill was moving through Congress. There\u2019s lots of extraneous material. It really depends, I would say my work is probably more documents-based than some other Hill reporters, because it is covering these very specific bills. If you're covering political dynamics, then it's more worth your time to chat with members in the halls. Because of the ways in which these bills are written, it is really important to talk with the people on the committees who are passing these bills: they're going to know where the bodies are buried, so to speak. I would read \u201cexpediting production\u201d and not have any alarm bells go off, but someone on the committee potentially would know \u2014 Although of course, in this case, they actually wouldn't. When these short-term spending bills have been passed, the bill text is like ten pages, because you've just been extending current funding levels. It\u2019s really more the foreign aid supplemental, or bills of that magnitude, where you have to get into the trenches and start reading page after page. I used to cover the NDAA , the defense policy bill that Congress passes every year, and"

    "keywords": "At Statecraft , we\u2019ve long been interested in the role economists play in policy. It\u2019s why we interviewed the White House coordinator of CHIPS Act implementation in January, and it\u2019s why today\u2019s guest is Martha Gimbel , former Senior Adviser at the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). Last week, Martha launched The Budget Lab at Yale , a \u201cnon-partisan policy research center dedicated to providing in-depth analysis of federal policy proposals for the American economy.\u201d The lab\u2019s initial projections have prompted debate (see, for example, their analysis of what will happen if the Trump tax cuts expire vs. John Carney\u2019s ). We sat down with Martha to unpack what the CEA is, how it works, and why you should care. Why are there so many federal economic councils? What\u2019s the difference between economics in academia and in government? What does the president need to know on Jobs Day? For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: Today\u2019s interviewee, Martha Gimbel Martha, tell us what you really care about. I have spent most of my career both working as an economist and, for lack of a better phrase, imposing process and order on groups of economists \u2014 which is a thing I very much enjoy doing. I've done that in the private sector, I've done that in government. This is going to sound so nerdy. I was a classics major in college, and Cicero once said that the Utile and the Honestum are the same thing. The useful thing and the morally good thing, in the long run, are the same thing. As a citizen, I really care about doing the honestum, and as an economist, I really care about doing the utile. So I care about finding the places where those things intersect. The example I always give is unemployment insurance, which I've spent a huge amount of time working on in my career. I feel that it is morally right to support people when they lose their jobs. It's also hugely economically beneficial, right? It is bad for society if people lose their jobs and then immediately just stop spending. I do think there are things that we talk about as either economic or moral imperatives, but they often cross over. The Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) is the executive office of the president's internal economic think tank. It was established via the Employment Act of 1946. It is the same act that established the Joint Economic Committee, which is on the Hill, where I also worked. It is the job of JEC to advise Congress on economic issues, and it is the job of CEA to advise the president on economic issues. CEA is most effective when its work is unbiased, right? That's not to say that you're not there to support the president. It's not to say that if you're not working for a particular administration that you're not trying to help them think through their priorities. It is the job of CEA to be in the room and say, \u201cOkay, here's this policy you're discussing, but here are all of these possible economic consequences that you haven't thought about and that we've analyzed. We've looked at the numbers and here's how you should think about it.\u201d That is a very fun role to play. It means that sometimes you're not everyone's favorite because you're the one coming in and saying, \u201cOkay, we have an exciting policy proposal to give every American family a dog, but how are we going to think about paying for the increased waste disposal that comes along with that?\u201d How do we deal with the fact that certain people's preferences are for cats? Are we providing a cash subsidy instead? Would it be more efficient to just provide a cash subsidy in general? Here's the analysis we've done on the economic implications of giving every family a dog. This will have X hit to GDP, because people will be staying home more often, because their dogs are cute. On the other hand, maybe happiness will go up.\u201d It is your job to provide the analysis behind that. I'm not sure what a group of economists should be called. A chart of economists? A heteroskedasticity ? Honestly it looks relatively similar. You have a group of economists together and you have to hit certain goals. In every institution that I've been a part of, the economists are there to help. \u201cHi, I'm Martha Gimbel. I'm an economist and I'm here to help.\u201d In the private sector, you were there to help the company understand the labor market. I worked at Indeed , which is a job site company, so they cared a lot about the labor market. And then also, frankly, to help them get positive PR by saying interesting things about the labor market in public so that they would get cited in the news. When you work in government, you're trying to make sure that policymakers understand the economics that you're doing. Part of what you're doing is in trying to organize groups of economists. Economists tend to get interested in everything we see. Someone will say something and another team member will say \u201cOh, wait, I really want to look at that.\u201d And you have to pull back and think, \u201cThat's a really interesting question, but is there an audience for that internally? What is the purpose that it's serving? Is this a fun side project you do on your own time? Is this something we really need to put resources behind? How does this fit in with other priorities? Is this something we need to do in the next week? Or is this something we need to be thinking about over the next six months?\u201d How do you convince economists to work on the thing that is immediately relevant to the organization and not their professional career? It's not just immediately relevant, right? Academic economists in particular are used to an environment where the time to publish is years. You are spending all of that time tearing the research apart eight ways from Sunday to try to make sure that you\u2019ve addressed any possible angle. This is not to say that what's done in the private sector or the public sector is not rigorous, it is and it needs to be. But it's different for a couple of reasons. One is it's just faster. If the president of the United States says to you, \u201cI have to make a decision on this policy issue tomorrow,\u201d and you say, \u201cGreat, we'll have a paper to you on that in seven years,\u201d that's not helpful. Second, academic economists, with some exceptions, are looking at something that's happened in the past, and trying to figure out what we can learn from that. In the private or public sectors, you're trying to be more forward looking. If we do this thing, what are the things that might happen? What are the things that we should be thinking about? There's absolutely some amount that is backward looking, 100%. But, a lot of the questions that are coming in are \u201chow should we think about this moving forward? What should we be anticipating?\u201d The instinct of many academic economists is to answer: Well, we don't know. Which, to be clear, is correct. But you have to be willing to guess, in the most rigorous but flexible way. And that is really, really hard. graphics from Ryan Buscaglia . Let me get a little more clarity on the non-partisan nature of CEA. I hear everything you're saying, and also, you come in for a particular administration and you're chosen by that administration. Is that right? So you said non-partisan, which is not what I said. I said unbiased. I think that that is a really important distinction. People have partisan preferences. I'm an economist. People's preferences are their preferences. Your job in the room is to serve the person that you have chosen to work for by being unbiased and by saying to them, \u201cYou may think that X policy is a really great idea, but we've analyzed it and here are these problems that you may not be thinking about.\u201d Other times it is to say, \u201cYou may think this policy is a really good idea and we've analyzed it and it is a really good idea. And here's all this analysis that we've produced on why you should do it.\u201d It's not helpful if you're in the room just telling people the version of economics that they want to hear. I forget who said this but if you have five economists in a room, you'll have six opinions. But that\u2019s part of the strength of CEA. Many academics work somewhat in isolation. CEA is not a large staff \u2014 it\u2019s somewhere between 30 and 40 people \u2014 but you\u2019re going to have multiple people who have an opinion on an issue. If you're the senior economist on an issue, you may write a memo saying, \u201cI think this is the way we should think about this policy.\u201d And then people are going to review that and say, \u201cWell, wait a minute. Here are these six things you didn't think about. And what about this paper that you didn't take into account?\u201d Then you go back and forth, and it makes your argument stronger. You have the chair who is confirmed by the Senate. Then you have two members who are the deputies. Underneath them you have senior economists \u2014 generally people with PhDs who are on leave from academic institutions or someplace in government. We've had professors from many different institutions spend a year at CEA. Then you have the junior staff. I am a big believer in any organization that 90% of the work gets done by the junior staff. You have staff economists who are generally on leave from PhD programs. Then you have research assistants who have just graduated from college or are a year or two out. You then have what is affectionately referred to as the front office, where I was as a senior advisor, which is in charge of imposing order and structure on the entire crew. When you say some folks are detailed over from other federal agencies: are those typically folks who have been specifically asked for by CEA team members? Sometimes CEA will call over to an agency and say, \u201cHey, we need someone who knows something about this issue. Do you have anyone?\u201d CEA also does something unusual; it runs an open recruiting process. If people get nothing else out of this conversation, this is the main thing I would like them to take away : CEA has an open recruiting process. You can email recruiting@cea.eop.gov and apply to be a staff economist, an RA, or a senior economist. Those applications get read. It is truly an open application process. That's not to say that it's not hard to get through, but as someone who used to own the recruiting inbox, we do read the applications. Sometimes people would blindly apply for a senior economist role, and we would go, \u201cWait, this person is amazing!\u201d CEA is in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is right next to the White House. Mark Twain once referred to it as the \u201cugliest building in D.C.\u201d I think it's beautiful. It looks very majestic. When you think that you're working in the Executive Office of the President, you probably visualize something like the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. I'm going to get in trouble for saying this, but I used to work at the Department of Labor, and I love the Department of Labor. It's not the nicest building. It is part of the policy process. Someone will say, \u201cHey, Russia invaded Ukraine and it\u2019s going to have impacts on energy markets. We should figure out what to do about this.\u201d The National Economic Council will run that process, but CEA will be in the meeting to provide whatever insights it can. One of the things CEA does that I personally think is the most fun is reviewing inflation, jobs, and GDP numbers. CEA actually gets those numbers the night before they are public and writes a memo for the President about what he should know about the next day\u2019s data. It's very intense because it's pre-release economic data. You have to take it very seriously, and cannot say anything about it outside of certain rooms. For instance, on Jobs Day, you get the numbers between 12pm and 2pm the day before. A small group of you sit in a room and have a long discussion about what it means, what we\u2019ve learned, what we should be paying attention to, and what is important for the President of the United States to know. You have to ask, \u201cDoes the President need to know about this, or do you just think it's interesting?\u201d Depending on the time frame, people want to hear from the president, particularly when the data are more stressful. Some of it is so he can remove it from his brain. For instance, I wrote the memo on unemployment insurance claims when I was a staff economist at CEA from 2014-2016. Most of the time we were trying to signal with the memo, \u201cYou do not need to worry about this data, we will tell you when it comes up.\u201d You don't want to be in a situation where he's in a meeting with reporters and someone says something to him about unemployment insurance (UI) claims and he is unaware. If there is a big surprise in the economic data, is there something that we need to be preparing for people in the morning? Keep in mind it\u2019s just CEA, the President, and some very few senior people who see it. You cannot call comms or speech writing and tell them, \u201cGDP is coming in hot tomorrow!\u201d Part of what you\u2019re doing is preparing at 8:31 AM to send materials that say, \u201cYou will be talking about this in an hour. Here\u2019s where we\u2019re going to be.\u201d There\u2019s the direction of the economy analysis, \u201cWhere do we think this thing is heading?\u201d There\u2019s also, \u201cWhat do we think the possible impacts of this policy could be?\u201d Sometimes we agree we should do some policy, but we don\u2019t know how much we should do. For example, the supplement on UI in the CARES Act . How do we determine the right amount to add on? Nobody knows. It\u2019s years later and we still don\u2019t know if it should have been that amount or this amount plus or minus $50. We\u2019ll be studying this forever. CEA is there to provide frameworks to think about this. If you do this amount, here\u2019s where that hits in the income distribution. Here is who that includes and leaves out. Here\u2019s what we know about labor market impacts. CEA puts that information together so that people can make an informed decision. There's actually very little in law that CEA has to do. We have to write the economic report of the President once a year. It\u2019s like 700 pages, I hope everybody has read up on it! Part of what you are trying to figure out is how to be productive and helpful in the building. Helpful in the room can look very different in academia and government. Nitpicking every little thing to death can be considered helpful in academia. In government, your job is to help people think through things. If every time someone suggests a new idea you respond with, \u201cwell, that\u2019s just dumb,\u201d you\u2019re not being helpful. More helpful is saying, \u201cI hear your idea, and here are 6 problems. Can you talk to me about the constraints you are under so I can help you optimize for those?\u201d We spend a lot of time figuring out how to optimize under constraints . CEA is there to be generalists. For instance, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has economists, but they\u2019re there to work on OSHA issues. People at CEA are there to provide frameworks to help think through problems, and to know who to call. If you're working on some occupational health issue, you're probably not the world expert in the economics of occupational health, just statistically. But you probably know who to call, and that's a lot of what you're doing. The National Economic Council is there to get stuff done. CEA\u2019s job is to sit there and think about the economics of an issue. Not that NEC doesn\u2019t do thinking or that CEA doesn\u2019t get stuff done, but NEC's job is to make sure the policy process around a particular issue happens, and once a policy has been decided, that it actually gets implemented. CEA people often become very attached to their corresponding NEC person because you spend a lot of time on the phone with them. I want to emphasize that the statistical agencies are independent, but one thing that CEA can do in the budget process is have conversations with academics and practitioners about what types of data are useful. Then you can call the Bureau of Labor Statistics and ask if they\u2019ve thought about this. Sometimes they\u2019ll say, \u201cWe\u2019ve thought about it, we\u2019d love to, but it would cost X amount.\u201d Then CEA can go into the budget process and demand this thing happen. The contingent worker survey from BLS has not been run in quite some time. It costs money. There have been all these questions in recent years about people working gig work. Technically it\u2019s called \u201ccontingent and alternative employment arrangements.\u201d The survey is looking at how they are employed. Do they have control over hours? Are the jobs temporary? Etc. Gig work is partly a definition thing. Economists would really like that survey to be run more often. The last time it was run was in May 2017. [ NB: BLS proposed to re-add the Contingent Worker Supplement to the Current Population Survey conducted in July 2023. ] There are things we rely on in its place, but they are not ideal. Which is why I will get on my soapbox and say that it's incredibly important that we fund the statistical agencies in the United States government. There's some things we try to rely on instead. Some economists have used tax data but that's hard. It's imperfect. Also, only some people get access to tax data. I can go right now and look at the contingent and alternative employment arrangements summary online. I can't just pop into the tax data. And to be clear, I don't think I should be able to for privacy reasons. Private sector people have tried to run surveys. People have tried to work with payroll companies, things like that, but it's really hard. Sometimes you rely on data from the companies themselves. That's also not ideal. I think what you're hearing is me saying the words \u201cnot ideal\u201d over and over again, which is why I will get back on my soapbox for a second and say again that it's incredibly important that we fund the statistical agencies in the United States government. So, it costs money. But, to take an earlier example, there's been all these questions in recent years about, \u201cAre more people working gig work?\u201d things like that. Economists would really like that survey to be run more often [ NB: It last ran in 2018 ]. It's technically called the contingent and alternative employment arrangements. And it's looking at, how are they employed? Do they have control over hours? Are the jobs temporary? This is partly a definition thing, and so this is a much longer conversation, but people will answer surveys differently depending on the type of phrasing you use, and you have to figure that out. There was some stuff that BLS did several years ago on green jobs which they've stopped doing. Part of that is that green jobs are really hard to define. For instance, if you work in an antique store, is that a green job? You're selling things that mean that people aren't having to produce more stuff. That wouldn't necessarily fall into people's traditional definition of green jobs. It can be a little bit fuzzy sometimes. They can combine things. They have access to data from the government but they can also work with private sector companies, many of whom provide their data to the US government. They also have the capability to run large and robust surveys. Although people are generally becoming less likely to respond to surveys. At IFP, we've looked a lot at peer review. Is the lag time in academia necessary? To be clear, I have never been a traditional academic. I will say other disciplines seem to have a faster review and publication process than economics and still produce rigorous work. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but my sense is that the review process in economics is extra long. Define \u201csuffer.\u201d Did we try every variation on a standard error that we possibly could before publishing something? No, we didn\u2019t. On the other hand, we optimized for people having rigorous information in time to make a decision. There are tradeoffs between how rigorous you are and how relevant you are, and CEA is about finding that sweet spot. Academia optimizes for not being wrong, and that is important. Government optimizes for information"

Today's guests, Jennifer Erickson and Greg Segal , argue a government-enabled monopoly is the culprit. We spoke with Erickson and Segal about how they successfully advocated for major fixes to the organ donation network. Erickson is a Senior Fellow with the Federation of American Scientists and former Assistant Director of Innovation for Growth in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Segal is the founder and CEO of Organize , a nonprofit patient advocacy group. Why are 28,000 organs going untransplanted annually? Why does 1% of the federal budget go to dialysis? Why has a sole bidder run the U.S. transplant system for decades? [Thanks to Rita Sokolova for her judicious transcript edits.] For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: Jennifer Erickson: What I will say out of the gate about the organ waiting list is that it alternatingly makes me want to turn over the table, it makes me so angry because it's unnecessary. But then also the great thing is, this is actually a healthcare problem that we can fix. The problem, it turns out, is actually the federal contractors. So who are the contractors? First, there are 55 local contractors. These are called organ procurement organizations or OPOs. Some have a state as their donation service area, some are across part of a state. Congress set up a monopoly contract in the eighties, called the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network, or OPTN. This national contract has only ever been held by one contractor, the United Network for Organ Sharing. If you've seen Grey's Anatomy or ER and they said \u201cI need a heart, get UNOS on the phone,\u201d that's UNOS. Just one example again of how bad it is: Greg and I recently got a whistleblower call in the last heat wave. Someone took a liver, a human liver that a family said yes to on the worst day of their life because a loved one died in an accident, and left it at the wrong hospital\u2019s cargo bay in 90 degree heat, and no one noticed for an hour and a half. The OPTN has a board to set policy. Who's on the board right now? The current board, the board members of the nation's Organ Procurement Transplantation Network, were until recently the exact same board members for the contractor, UNOS. So, literally, they would meet on a Sunday as OPTN board members and then on a Monday as UNOS board members. To say it's a conflict is an understatement: it's a Venn diagram that just is one circle. It's really, really bad. So as a first thing, this legacy board is still deciding policy for the nation. There are ongoing, bipartisan Congressional investigations into conflicts of interest and corruption. The tech is so bad. The United States Digital Service found 17 days of downtime in recent years. Until recently, the algorithm that was protecting all organ donor patient information in the country, so STI status, mental health, every physical history, was from 1996. This is a fixable problem: it\u2019s about the contractor, supply chain, it\u2019s logistics, transparency. Congress unanimously passed a bill in July. The only other thing that passed unanimously that day was Tony Bennett Day. Senator Todd Young, a Republican from Indiana, who lost a friend waiting for a heart, has done a lot of oversight into OPOs, including the OPO in Indiana. And in one year of that oversight \u2014 this has been peer reviewed and published \u2014 organ donation in the state of Indiana went up by 44 percent. It went up by 44 percent because they approached 57 percent more families. What in the hell was that government contractor doing before Todd Young started asking questions? JE: The predecessor organization to UNOS lobbied heavily to insert language into the National Organ Transplant Act ( NOTA ) that stipulated that, to compete for this contract, a contractor has to be an independent nonprofit with expertise in organ donation and transplantation. That phrase has always been interpreted to mean UNOS. In 2018, the last time there was an open contracting cycle, you had to have three years of experience to even submit a bid to the federal government. Now, that might sound sensible until you realize that there\u2019s a national monopoly and only one group has ever had three years of experience. So no one else applied. The United States Digital Service produced a report called Lives are at Stake , which is not a normal name for a government report. It's a way of writing it in flashing red letters. They identified that phrase in NOTA as one that has restricted competition across decades, and in the summer of 2023, both the Senate and the House unanimously passed the Securing the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Act , which removed it. President Biden signed that into law in September. It was surprising even to Greg and me how this news broke through in the national media, but I think it was because Americans inherently know that monopolies are bad and no one, unless you're in this very particular world of organ donation, was aware that there was a national organ monopoly and that they were funding as taxpayers, and which has spectacularly failed patients. JE: I think one really important thing to know is that these organ donation contractors are funded by the taxpayer. Organ procurement is cost reimbursed , which means that pretty much anything organ procurement organizations pay for gets reimbursed by readers, by taxpayers. From Organ Donation Reform That\u2019s how you end up with organ contractor executives flying around on private jets and going to Sonoma wine retreats while the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) say they're failing basic government performance metrics. If you're really worried about which vineyard you take your board to, you're probably not spending a ton of time thinking about how to staff underserved hospitals in the middle of the night. I think the system has stayed broken for so long because they had budgets to market themselves. There\u2019s a halo effect here: 95% of Americans support organ donation . That literally polls higher than puppies and ice cream. So there's this tremendous amount of goodwill that the organ contractors not only benefit from, but actively pay to perpetuate through good news stories, by sponsoring the Rose Bowl and professional sports teams. And despite wild executive perks and abuse of funds, these contractors are nominally nonprofits. So no one was ever looking under the hood. And I really want to give credit to Greg here. When I was in the Obama administration in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , Greg\u2019s organization brought us data showing 28,000 organs going unrecovered every year, showing which organs were going unrecovered in which states. That put it into technicolor for us that we had not only a preventable, outrageous tragedy and a responsibility to actually fix it and prevent it. Greg and the researchers that he worked with showed that there are 17,500 kidneys, 7,500 livers, 1,500 hearts, and 1,500 lungs that go untransplanted every year from potential American organ donors. For scale, that means the United States does not need to have a waiting list for livers, hearts, or lungs within three years, and the kidney waiting list should come way down. That data convinced not only the Obama administration, but also the Trump administration. This reform movement has now crossed three administrations, and that almost never happens. Greg Segal: So our organization, Organize , was awarded the Innovator in Residence position in the secretary's office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from 2015 to 2016. We were still technically a non-governmental nonprofit, but in some sense, we were embedded within HHS. We had different levels of data access and we used ICD-9 codes , which have since been revised to ICD-10 , to paint an objective picture of how well, or in many cases, how poorly, these industry stakeholders were performing. Many people probably directionally knew that something was amiss in this system, but it was very opaque. Before having this data, it was hard to articulate what was going on to members of Congress, and you sometimes felt like you were Christopher Lloyd from Back to the Future , where you're just the forensic accountant or crazy person in the office. GS: We could access it as private citizens, but HHS employees really helped us understand why things were set up the way that they were, how things were coded, and which one of our ten ideas might actually be implementable. As Jennifer always says, government works by analogy. We had so many different ideas, and then civil servants would very soberly explain to us why nine of them were just completely unfeasible. When you're left with the one idea, that does not guarantee that it will happen. We then needed help understanding the ten different analogous projects that have happened in the last ten years to figure out how to implement ours. So we used government data, and we validated it with some external data voluntarily shared from industry to verify that what we were doing was directionally correct with what was happening in industry. JE: One of the things that really helped was the specificity. There had previously been federally funded research showing that in the United States as few as one in five organ donors were having their organs recovered. So four in five were not, right? We knew that there was a gap between the huge support for organ donation and what was actually happening. What I\u2019ve learned is that if there\u2019s a big national problem, the government often does exactly the wrong thing. It punts, it does another big study, a consensus conference. What you really need to understand is the data: what is happening in the state of Virginia, what's happening across Texas or California. There are 55 of these organ procurement organizations, and we found a 470% variability in recovery between the top performers and the lowest performers. You need to ask, \u201cWhat are the top performers doing that the bottom performers are not?\u201d That really helps you get specific and follow the data to find problems you can solve. JE: So keep in mind, there's a huge generosity of spirit and national agreement about organ donation. Most people, myself included before I started this work, think of organ donation as, \u201cDid you tick a box at the DMV when you got a driver's license?\u201d And that really isn't the story of what happens. In the United States, only 2-3% percent of deaths are organ donation-eligible. That includes car and motorcycle accidents, overdoses, strokes, and traumas: something that means a patient isn't going to make it, but up to eight of their organs might. When someone is dying in an organ donation-eligible way, that hospital calls the organ procurement organization they're assigned to. That OPO is supposed to turn up to every potential case in a timely and compassionate way and have one of two conversations with the family: \u201cSmith family, I'm so sorry for your loss. Jane was a registered organ donor. We'd like to proceed with her wishes.\u201d Or, \u201cSmith family, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Jane seemed like a wonderful person. Can we talk to you about organ donation?\u201d Keep in mind that 95% of Americans support organ donation. My older brother is a registered organ donor, and if, God forbid, something happened to him, and someone approached me at the hospital in a timely and compassionate way, I would consent to organ donation. If they do not approach me, then I cannot consent. If they do not show up at the hospital, even if he ticked the box at the DMV, those organs cannot be recovered. Another problem is that when they do show up, OPOs are not required to have basic standards of clinical care . So another way in which organs are lost is medical mistakes . Organs are literally lost and damaged in transit every single week. The OPTN contractor is 15 times more likely to lose or damage an organ in transit than an airline is a suitcase. That should be shocking. Think about a donor family agreeing to organ donation on the worst day of their life, and what it means if their loved one's kidney gets left on the airport counter in Atlanta, or gets delayed and then thrown in the trash in another part of the country. And then, of course, what that means to one of the 100,000 Americans waiting to get that call for a lifesaving transplant. GS: I\u2019ll also share a lesson on advocacy. There's a rare genetic condition in my family which causes heart failure. My dad and aunt had heart transplants, another aunt died waiting for her transplant. I spent a lot of time running around D.C., talking to people about the organ donation system, and had a lot of sympathetic meetings where people heard me out. I think I convinced them that I was right, and then they moved on to the next meeting and never thought about me again. Then I realized that kidneys are not only just as important as hearts, but far more expensive to taxpayers. If you need a kidney, you are almost certainly waiting on dialysis, which is then paid for by Medicare. In 2019, treatment for kidney failure cost Medicare $36 billion \u2014 it might be higher now, and is certainly higher if you include Medicaid numbers and VA numbers. One percent of the entire federal budget goes to dialysis . So we started foregrounding kidneys in our advocacy, but reform to the kidney donation system, at least the deceased donation system, is a vehicle for the same reforms for all of the organ categories. After we started talking about the importance of helping people get kidney transplants, within a year or two, there was a presidential directive on reforming the organ donation system that rode on the Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health . I was so blinded by telling my story that I didn't think for a while about what's actually going to resonate most with a person across the table from me. And in D.C., often that is not just who has the most sympathetic issue, but whose issue has a pay-for to it. JE: There are two areas of healthcare that are still under cost reimbursement, which means the taxpayer funds the vast majority of the system: critical access hospitals and organ procurement. As Greg alluded to, because of some amazing patient advocacy in the 1970s, kidneys have a unique classification and end-stage renal disease is the only major disease that qualifies you for Medicare regardless of age. In 1971, a patient was dialyzed on the floor of Congress , and Congress decided they needed to help patients on dialysis and made an exception so that disease could be covered by Medicare. So if we can get patients a kidney transplant, not only can they live a much better quality of life, which is what Greg and I care about, we can also save the taxpayer up to $1.5 million per patient in foregone dialysis. It's really rare in healthcare that patient and taxpayer interests are so closely aligned. JE: I think there were a few things. One is, you actually have two different types of contractors. The national contractor, OPTN, was supposed to be overseen by HRSA, which is one agency of HHS. The dozens of local OPOs are supposed to be overseen by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). So you already had this division of oversight, and both agencies would say, \u201cWe have this government contractor \u2014 UNOS \u2014 that is supposed to be looking out over the whole system.\u201d Here I'll quote Senator Chuck Grassley , who\u2019s been investigating this since 2005. He said, \u201cAsking one contractor to look out for dozens of others is like asking the fox to guard the chicken house.\u201d It's fundamentally a failed model. It has left patients in a terrible and deadly position. The Lives are at Stake report details a continuous erosion of leverage from the government through the contracting cycles. For example, the report says that UNOS threatened to walk away and operate the U.S. transplant system outside the contract, which would be incredibly bad faith behavior. Government isn't a monolith, but I think some people in government perhaps thought they didn\u2019t have alternatives. Keep in mind that OPOs are on four-year contracting cycles, and UNOS, the OPTN, has been on five-year contracting cycles. So all these contractors have had to do is withstand scrutiny during a contracting period, and then they're in for four or five more years. A Forbes piece in 1999 called UNOS a \u201ccartel\u201d, and \u201cthe federal monopoly that's chilling the supply of transplantable organs and letting Americans who need them die needlessly.\u201d Donna Shalala , who was the Secretary of HHS under President Bill Clinton, called out UNOS misinformation in a Congressional hearing back in 1998 and called for competition in the field. The then-leader of HRSA called for an end to the stranglehold of the UNOS monopoly, and yet 25 years later, UNOS is still the monopoly contractor in charge. I think people of goodwill tried to introduce reform, but UNOS still managed to keep the contract. JE: There have been some tremendous surgeons who have spoken up, and three have testified before three different congressional hearings in recent years, saying that too many of their patients are dying, and the system has to be fixed. There's also been investigative reporting about UNOS threatening whistleblowers . I'm grateful for voices for reform and I just want to acknowledge that this is why the government has to act. JE: It did, but there were two problems. One, when it came to contracting, there was often a strict interpretation of that phrase in NOTA, which kept constraining competition. I would also say that there are other oversight responsibilities that both HRSA and CMS should use and never have. The technology of UNOS is deeply failing and antiquated \u2014 for hours at a time, it will shut down and no organs across the country can be matched. Organs are all on a clock, right? There's only so much cold ischemic time, or time outside the body, they can have. An astounding one out of every four kidneys that's recovered from a generous American organ donor is thrown in the trash . The federal government has never held UNOS or any OPOs accountable for that. Until recent data-driven regulation passed, CMS could not pull a contract from a failing OPO. They tried to decertify the Arkansas OPO in 1999, but ultimately lost in court because the regulation was written so badly , yet CMS didn't update it for 21 years until 2020. That update, which passed under both President Trump and President Biden , was the first big win for patient advocates. OPOs will be held accountable for their performance this year. Between that and the Securing the U.S. OTPN Act that removed the restrictive phrase that propped up the national organ monopoly, we\u2019re hoping that 2024 is a different year. GS: If you'll indulge me, I\u2019ll add one other quick piece of context from 1999, not just as a history lesson, but because it is fiercely relevant now. GS: It\u2019s one thing for HRSA to say that we need more competition back in 1999, but government contracting doesn\u2019t let them just pick whoever they want and bet on them. HRSA can only respond to credible bids that meet contracting requirements. The Forbes report mentioned that UNOS was interfering with other competitors\u2019 bids, but even if everyone knew that, HRSA\u2019s hands would still have been tied. Talk to me about how you worked with Senate offices. JE: I mentioned how Greg brought this issue to the White House when I was in the Obama administration.

    "keywords": "Over the past month, we conducted four interviews on American nation-building in Afghanistan and Iraq. We gathered a healthy range of interviewees: a CIA operative, a USAID procurement officer, a State Department reformer, and a State science adviser. We tackled these interviews with the aim of better understanding how American nation-building efforts worked, institutionally and bureaucratically, and I think we were broadly successful. Our interviewees gave honest, straightforward, and enlightening answers about their failures and missteps, as well as successes. For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: 1. Expertise is extremely rare. We saw a couple different flavors of this problem. In Afghanistan, short rotations meant USAID contracting officers had very little time to get up to speed. As Kyle Newkirk said, \u201cIf you factor in Rest and Recuperation leave and vacation, out of 13 months you might've only had to be in country for 36 weeks or so.\u201d How the Government Loses a Road Santi Ruiz \u00b7 March 6, 2024 Read full story Safety restrictions meant officers could rarely personally assess the status of development projects. As a result, contracting officers often had no idea where projects under their jurisdiction even were, let alone their status. Additionally, contracting was done through primes, in part to outsource the risk of accidentally violating anti-terrorism funding provisions. In the CIA, and the intelligence community broadly, there just aren\u2019t enough people with expertise in the places they\u2019re working. Laura Thomas told us, \u201cNot every officer, I think, is poring over every historical book and reading everything they possibly could before they deploy. They should be, but there's just not the time.\u201d How to Run a CIA Base in Afghanistan Santi Ruiz \u00b7 March 13, 2024 Read full story In the State Department, we don\u2019t have a culture of learning from mistakes, which hinders the development of expertise. Says Dan Spokojny , \u201cWhen you really look at the incentive structures and the behaviors of the organization, there's really not a lot of space for people to accept failure, or to admit that the policy didn't work.\u201d In Iraq, Alex Dehgan stood up a major science funding project with $2 million in cash, brought back in installments from Kuwait in his backpack. Although he and his team had to problem-solve creatively, they were effective on a limited budget. How to Recruit Iraqi Weapons Scientists Santi Ruiz \u00b7 March 21, 2024 Read full story By contrast, USAID\u2019s budget was constantly growing, which became a problem. As Newkirk highlighted, \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the capacity to manage billions of dollars in a very complicated environment\u2026 If we had clear aims and a slower ramp and didn\u2019t also have to manage Iraq as well, we could have prioritized what we thought were the key things, because there was so much to do\u2026 I think the ring road project was probably the right call, the whole country needed that interconnectivity. It probably would have made more sense to then focus on telecoms, rather than reinventing agriculture far away from Kabul. And that would have allowed us to ramp thoughtfully.\u201d This is well known, but I was struck at how many problems in the interviews were downstream of that tension between the State Department and the Department of Defense, from restrictions on consular travel in Afghanistan to roadblocks in Iraq. As Dehgan put it, \u201cWhen I got to Iraq, there was not a lot of interest in supporting the State Department programs that were on the ground. You had to be really entrepreneurial to make this thing work.\u201d This is a shame, because in some ways the agencies could clearly learn from each other. As Spokojny puts it, \u201cThe Department of Defense\u2026 has doctrine processes, where it studies the way it\u2019s conducted business in basically every aspect of the organization. We bring those to our system of war colleges. We try to think hard about how to create patterns of instructions that we can then train and teach the next generation... Those processes build in opportunities for learning.\u201d How to Fix the State Department Santi Ruiz \u00b7 March 27, 2024 Read full story In a future interview, I\u2019d like to better understand where this tension between agencies comes from, and who has managed to build strong cross-agency relationships. Recommendations welcome. A note on the final interview: during it, I challenged Spokojny on a set of citations in his think tank\u2019s manifesto, \u201c Less Art, More Science: Transforming U.S. Foreign Policy through Evidence, Integrity, and Innovation .\u201d From that conversation. As mentioned, there have been critiques of the McKinsey report for several years, including that the results should not be generalized, or that causation runs the other way. But a new paper published on Monday in Econ Watch goes a step further, and finds McKinsey\u2019s results can't even be replicated. \u201cOur inability to [replicate] their results suggests that ... they should not be relied on to support the view that US publicly traded firms can expect to deliver improved financial performance if they increase the racial/ethnic diversity of their executives.\u201d Should the State Department manage information better internally, as Spokojny argues? I came away interested in this idea and the ways it could be implemented. But should State integrate more political science literature into its decision-making processes? On the evidence provided in the interview, color me unconvinced. This month, we have some exciting individual interviews lined up, covering: How America\u2019s organ procurement system got broken, and possibly fixed Why federal agencies stink at hiring How the Council of Economic Advisors actually works And we\u2019re prepping another series for May that colleague Alec Stapp calls \u201cthe coolest Statecraft project yet.\u201d No hints. If you like Statecraft , consider adding it to your recommended publications here on Substack, sharing it with a friend, or tweeting about us.

But we\u2019ve also received consistent feedback from readers: sometimes Statecraft can be a little too wonky, too brainy. One reader asks, \u201care there any lessons from Statecraft that apply to normal people like me?\u201d It\u2019s a good question, and the answer is yes . Following extensive consultations with readers and policy practitioners, we\u2019re launching a new series, taking lessons from policy practitioners and applying them to the most intimate, human policy challenge: love. For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: Unlike traditional Statecraft interviews, Datecraft will not contain roadmaps for readers trying to get big hairy things done. We will not push anyone to explain just \u201chow the sausage gets made.\u201d Public, private partnerships are a sensitive topic. Rather, Datecraft will strive to help illuminate the inner workings of our affinitive attachments by speaking to people who have built up insider knowledge of how things really work. We\u2019ll be showcasing a range of perspectives: although datecraft is the art of the possible, we have as much to learn from notable failures as from the most admirable successes. Building romantic capacity isn\u2019t about turning one dial in a particular direction: each date study will tell us something novel. As Eva Illouz writes about \u201cromantic postmodernity\u201d in The End of Love : If traditional cultural sociology is based on the assumption that actors have strategies of action, \u2026 what is precisely difficult for actors is to develop a strategy of action for their relationships . To help develop our own relationship strategies of action, we asked experts in family policy to weigh in. In an essay for First Things , you point out that we're bad at knowing what we'll want in the future, or who we'll want; we're bad prediction machines. How can we get better at finding a romantic partner? \u201cWe\u2019re \u201cbad prediction machines\u201d because there is an art of falling in love at first sight \u2014 and we've lost it. It takes skill to see a potential spouse in the slope of a shoulder, the love of your life in a laugh overheard from across the room. Think Dante and Beatrice, Rosalind and Orlando! As Blaise Pascal says, the heart has its reasons \u2014 and if you learn to listen to them well (and question them intelligently), they will guide you better than any dating app algorithm.\u201d Patrick, you write the excellent newsletter Family Policy Updates . What is your family policy? \u201cPersonally, my family policy is that there is to be no jumping on the nice sofa. But on a macro level my policy is that the state needs to do something about the positive externalities of having kids. \u201cIt may not feel like it when my kids are making their presence extremely felt on an airplane or at the library, but a society with fewer kids is one with lower long-term growth, higher political tensions, and fewer opportunities to be pulled out of ourselves to focus on what really matters. Left to their own devices, markets are incredible tools at sanding away inefficiencies, and having kids certainly leads to higher costs (measured both in the cost of berries and diapers as well as forgone income and career advancement). So there\u2019s a role for the state to compensate families a little for the burdens they bear as well as keep an eye on barriers (like housing costs ) that can prevent families from forming in the first place.\u201d Your book Rethinking Sex: A Provocation was hailed as both a \"call to arms\" and a \"searing examination.\" But can a searing examination make for a good date? \u201cThe point of dating is to get to know someone in a low-stakes setting, not to interrogate them! So no, a \u2018searing examination\u2019 generally doesn\u2019t make for a good date (although I'm sure there are exceptions -- and I'd love to hear the story!) \u201cThat said it is worth examining *yourself* before you get out there onto the romantic scene. What beliefs do you hold about sex and relationships, and are they actually true, and helpful? Are you prepared to treat your fellow daters ethically and with care? If not, maybe put off the date -- or cross-examination-- until you\u2019ve figured that out.\u201d You\u2019ve previously argued that Phyllis Schlafly was right about quite a bit. But what can today's young lovers learn from the marriage of Fred and Phyllis Schlafly? \u201cFred and Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s marriage shows us that the \u2018strongest\u2019 women are those married to strong men.

    "keywords": "This month, Statecraft has focused on America\u2019s attempts to build nations in Iraq and Afghanistan. We think these stories are a great opportunity to get a closer look at what we mean by \u201cstate capacity.\u201d Massive stateside bureaucracies attempted to build new, stable institutions in foreign countries. How did those bureaucracies perform? How about the institutions we built abroad? Last week, we talked to the man tasked with setting up a civilian science community in Iraq after 2003: How to Recruit Iraqi Weapons Scientists Santi Ruiz \u00b7 March 21, 2024 Read full story In our final installment, we wanted to zoom out, and look at the State Department as a whole. So we got in touch with Dan Spokojny , a former Foreign Service officer and diplomat. Spokojny is also the founder and CEO of fp21 , a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank that advocates for more data and evidence in foreign policy decision-making. In today\u2019s interview, we had a productive argument about exactly that topic. Why do presidents prefer the National Security Council to State? How do diplomats receive information? Why don\u2019t we learn from foreign policy mistakes? For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: Help me understand why that is. Starting with a little history might be helpful. The National Security Council didn't exist as a coordinating body until after World War II, when President Truman saw the need for a body that would link the different military services, the State Department, the Department of Treasury, and all instruments of national security policy so they\u2019d pull in the same direction. The NSC, passed as part of the National Security Act of 1947 , was born as this coordination mechanism, owned by the president. Now, fast forward 80 years, and the NSC has grown to being a primary policymaking body in itself. It's still a relatively small organization: between 200-400ish staff over the last couple decades, which isn't so large when you consider the sweep of issues they have to manage from intelligence to defense, to diplomacy, development, economics, etc. Yet there are some interesting complications here. When you work at the NSC, you serve \u201cat the pleasure of the president.\u201d You're not Senate-confirmed . There's no real congressional oversight. So it becomes much easier for the President and the National Security Advisor to exercise political control and unified direction of the national security issues. That's great, except you're pushing a lot of decision-making authority to a small group of people, who can't possibly know the issues as well as the executive agencies that they control. Those executive agencies have congressional oversight. That\u2019s for reasons we could debate, but generally, I think, it\u2019s for good democratic purposes. They\u2019re large, developed bureaucracies with Senate-confirmed heads. There's a trade off between executive control and competency, and the National Security Council has become this place where a lot of executive control is exercised. Instead of creating interagency procedures where goals can be taken on by different organizations and move in the same direction, currently each organization is its own universe, its own world, its own Cabinet agency with its own control, and they may push in very different directions. So the National Security Council is like a bandaid on top of this uncoordinated system to try to bring it together at the end. From defense to diplomacy to assistance to economic instruments, these things tend to work in stovepipes and then come together at the very top. I have to begin by being complimentary of an institution that developed me professionally. The State Department has been integral in shaping U.S. foreign policy. It's the oldest executive agency, it\u2019s been around since almost the founding of this country. It's an extraordinary place that holds extraordinary expertise. That said, let's pick it apart. Nixon called State \u201ca bunch of eunuchs.\u201d JFK said it's a \u201cbowl of jelly.\u201d Presidents from both sides of the aisle have overtly or implicitly pulled authority away from its diplomats. The State Department is supposed to be the lead author of national security policy, but it hasn't played that role in a very long time. Now, the reasons for this are complicated. One could say it's about the amount of money and reach and influence that our military has. The Department of Defense is massive, so you're going to trust the institution with more resources and reach at the end of the day. Same with the intelligence community, which is actually a collection of more than a dozen agencies [how this number is calculated varies ] . Across the national security apparatus, you're going to lean on these infrastructures that are more well-resourced than the State Department. There are some other structural challenges with the Department of State. Creating diplomatic policies to confront controversial, high-profile issues tends to be less politically satisfying than tough rhetoric from the military. A carefully crafted diplomatic intervention is never going to be as sexy as a clear statement of \u201cthou shall not cross our red line.\u201d So the work of the Department of State is less politically cool to talk about for presidents. And further, there's a history here that dates back to Joseph McCarthy , that the State Department came under a really aggressive political attack, many of its people have been fired. It was accused of losing China because it was too soft on communism. The diplomats, perhaps by actual political preference or temperamentally, lean more towards soft civilian interventions, and they've tended to be seen as a little more left-leaning. That perhaps undermined their ability to play a role in a complicated bipartisan operation. Lastly, we can go to culture. Diplomats are not known for being loud spoken. They're not known for being clever political actors. The Foreign Service is not terribly known for taking big risks. I think diplomats have failed to fully accept being real foreign policy leaders in a more complicated role. But in your day-to-day work, you focus on reforming the State Department\u2019s processes. Tell me why we should think process is a top tier priority for foreign policy reform, as opposed to, say, clearing out the communists. My view is that State should take responsibility for its own shortcomings. The way it's done business hasn't changed for a hundred years. The way that it makes decisions remains, in the words of diplomats, an art and not a science. Decisions tend to come from the intuitions of our leaders. They tend to come from people who are dedicated, hardworking, and who often have deep cultural expertise, knowledge, language ability, have lived in these countries. But that sort of intuitive, idiosyncratic, ad hoc approach to policymaking is ill-suited for a more complicated century and world. It leads to a great deal of bias in the way that decisions are made and information is taken in. Just imagine being a foreign policy official at the top of the food chain, trying to manage issues from across the world. The amount of information \u2013 news that's breaking, analysis from think tanks, journalists and intelligence and your own people \u2013 is absolutely overwhelming. Without a system that thoughtfully manages that insight, boils it down to clear understandings of how the world is moving, and creates clear doctrine or tradecraft \u2013 none of which the State Department has \u2013 your official is overwhelmed and has to rely on easily biased heuristics. That's part of why the State Department has been unable to prove to presidents, Congress, and perhaps even the American people for some decades now that it can take its endowed role of being the leader of foreign policy seriously. So I've suggested that instead of just demanding more power, the State Department needs to retool, and take on new methods of decision-making and strategy and operationalizing their work. That's right on. Yeah, this is like old Herbert Simon academic research on cybernetic approaches to decision-making. We\u2019re not calling for eliminating intuition or creativity, or the human relational aspect of foreign policy, but to create methods within the process of diplomacy to capture what works and to really focus on learning within the world of foreign policy. Let me give an example of a thing that we can focus on and create more rigor around. We have ceasefire negotiations, mediations, peace processes going on all around the world. There's no central body of knowledge at the Department of State that says, \u201cHey, here's some case studies of success and failure.\u201d There's no central manual that says, \u201cHere's some best practices,\u201d or a checklist for how you might go about managing this process, or the expertise of the team that you might want to recruit in order to manage this negotiation. There's no training for how to be a good leader in this space. We let our diplomats \u2013 very thoughtful, dedicated expert people \u2013 just custom-make their responses to each of these situations. \u201cWe elected this president, and he appointed Joe Schmoe. If State bureaucrats are telling him, \u2018Don't go to this negotiation, it's not best practice,\u2019 it shouldn't be State's call to make.\u201d What's your response? We live in a democracy, and in a democracy, your elected leaders respond to the will of the people. They are representatives, not just conduits of civilian preferences. So you still need some expertise in these bureaucracies to direct the process. Let me use an analogy. If I'm a bureaucrat at NASA, my job is to engineer engines that work and to build spaceships that fly and won't explode. Now, that doesn't mean that I'm going to override the will of the political leaders of NASA. Those leaders still get to decide, \u201cHow much money are we going to spend? What missions do we take on? How do we evaluate risk? Where do we source our materials from?\u201d But you still have engineers at some point to say, \u201cListen, I can tell you this engine is going to work and this engine's not. If you want to land on Mars, we're going to have to plot this trajectory.\u201d I think we can make that same assumption about how foreign policy works. \u201cYou tell us what you want to accomplish broadly, Mr. President and Congress. And it's our jobs to say, \u2018let me build you a policy that's actually going to work to achieve those goals.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd if you want to change that policy and say, \u2018We're no longer going to be at war in this place. We're actually going to shift our resources to another location.\u2019 Fine. We can try to explain to you what we think the implications of the decision are, and we can design a policy that's going to be effective to achieve that pivot.\u201d That's how bureaucracies work in a healthy way. In the academic literature here, there is a discussion about tradeoffs between competency and control. The more political influence in a bureaucracy you have \u2013 politically appointed ambassadors, for example \u2013 the more control the president will have. And control is a good thing. You're elected to shift policy. Let's say we were running the Iraq War for many years, and the people spoke and said, \u201cWe want to get out of this war.\u201d And a new political leader comes up and pivots us away from the war. A president wants to be able to control a bureaucracy that often carries a lot of inertia. On the other hand, the research suggests as you get more and more control, it actually washes out some of the competency that is expressed by that organization. You sacrifice effectiveness. One has to properly balance that. With this Department of State, there are a high ratio of political leaders, more than just about any other Cabinet agency. Many of our ambassadorships and high-level positions are not led by careerists, but by appointed political leaders, so perhaps the needle is tipped too far in one way. To me, there's a clear weakness in your analogy. Most people think the NASA engineer is more likely to be correct when he says, \u201cBoss, that rocket won't fly,\u201d than when the State bureaucrat says \u201cBoss, that ceasefire won't work.\u201d Tell me why I'm wrong. Sure. Yes. Clearly orbital mechanics is considered a hard science and political science is considered a soft science. Yet you'll actually find NASA is a great example. NASA had a couple of rockets explode in the last millennia. Those were not, it turned out, engineering problems. The infamous O-ring on the Challenger that exploded was not an engineering failure, really. The engineers knew there was a weak mechanism there and a high risk of failure due to abnormal weather conditions, and they said, \u201cHey, please do not launch this rocket.\u201d And the decision makers who weren't taking in that risk properly said, \u201cI've got a launch on schedule. The president's breathing down my neck. It's a perfect day. We've got the film crews ready. Let's go ahead and launch.\u201d So it turned out it wasn't an engineering problem. It was a decision-making problem. It was a problem of not taking the knowledge in to properly calibrate the risk. Whether it's a hard science or a soft science, one still needs to properly calibrate risk and uncertainty. I think that's where often the State Department fails, is that it's unable to properly calibrate its risk and understand the likely impact of its tools. If one thinks more scientifically in the craft of foreign policy, it's not about saying this will 100 percent work or 100 percent fail, but, based upon the evidence that we've gathered, we can be more calibrated with our risk and our uncertainty. Rather than just saying, \u201cI know what to do with the evil Russians, we must push back against them.\u201d That sort of gut instinct, normatively-driven policy often makes for great talking points, I think, but it often falls short in the way that we manage our foreign policy. Are there other nations with foreign policy processes that do better evidentiary work? Can we tell that they're better at foreign policy? I believe businesses are generally better run than the Department of State, that seems like a no brainer. But are there other international success cases for what you're talking about? I don't have a great answer for you. I haven't done or seen a really thorough analysis. Part of the challenge is, these are really opaque bureaucracies. There's very little rigorous research on the function of foreign affairs bureaucracies in the US or elsewhere. It\u2019s very hard to learn about what really works and to hold the institutions accountable for success and failure. That said, I think we can point to some interesting processes. The European Union External Action Service said, \u201cWe want to prioritize more thoughtfully in the way that we design strategies. And we really want those strategies to be driven from a bottom-up understanding of challenges on the ground, particularly when it comes to conflict.\u201d So they created this conflict analysis program with a structured set of questions that they sent to each one of their missions in each country around the world, asking, \u201cWhat do you see as the biggest potential threats? How will those threats unravel?\u201d These questions were driven by social science understanding of the indicators of instability or potential civil war. They were able to gather rigorous, comparable information from every one of their missions, and aggregate that upwards and say, \u201cYear on year we're able to detect where we think the biggest instability is coming from.\u201d Do they use that knowledge in a more effective way? I can't say, Santi. But that sort of process really appeals to me. We currently have more of an instinctual response: we\u2019ve got to pay attention to Somalia today and we\u2019ve got to pay attention to Brazil tomorrow. That's our manifesto. That's right. That case study was written by a former colleague who worked in the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO). It\u2019s a fairly new structure at State tasked with thinking strategically about conflict prevention, and preventing mass atrocities and genocide. I learned a great deal from working in this bureau. They bring in a lot of social scientific approaches. They're really, in some ways, the leaders within the department of bringing more strategic thinking to problems. I think that they were the first State office to build an advanced analytics operation that used more computer-assisted, quantitative, and social scientific methods. Yet CSO is not very well integrated into State. The way State works is, regional bureaus own the turf: it's the Africa Bureau and the Western Hemisphere Bureau and so on, and those are the power centers of the department. It's where people get their jobs from to go out to embassies. It's where the Foreign Service officers like to live. The functional bureaus work on cross-cutting issues: Democracy, Rights and Labor, CSO itself and others, they have to ask permission from the regional bureaus to go work into those organizations. Because they don\u2019t own the turf, the functional bureaus tend to have less authority over shaping international policy. It's one of the structural choices that State has made to organize itself: it's still built on a very bilateral model. So executing foreign policy is country-to-country, rather than transnational. If one wants to make climate change policy, for instance, a priority for the State Department, you need to convince ambassadors in every single relevant country to prioritize this issue, which is a much harder process. Other countries do it differently, and make their cross-cutting issues central. Some people would say that our entire policy since 2017, after the strategic changes you mentioned, has been a debacle. Mali , Niger , and Burkina Faso are all run by Russian-backed juntas. Violence in northern Nigeria has gotten much worse . [ NB: Since this interview was conducted, Niger revoked its military cooperation agreement with the US, following a \u201cvery tense\u201d meeting with a State Department official. ] To me, that suggests it's hard to show these programs are effective. Yes, I think that's fair. Yes, assessing counterfactuals is a core precept of scientific understanding. It's very complicated in complex environments, which characterizes basically any foreign policy objective. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't do it. And it doesn't mean that it's impossible. Right now at State, there's almost zero lessons learned programs. There's almost no \u201c hotwash \u201d program. There's almost no evaluation of strategic effectiveness. We don't promote our officials on whether they were successful in achieving objectives. And then there's a harder version, which is, \u201cDo retrospective analysis according to a modern polisci, scientific method process, using some rigorous academic procedure.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t it be valuable for State to start by just doing more accountability and internal assessment, even if it wasn't according to this contemporary political science model? Absolutely. Yes. There's really no perfect way to do these evaluations, and political scientists, social scientists, historians, and sociologists will fight endlessly about different methods. That's healthy in a process, and there will always be disagreement in how you evaluate these policies. Learning requires feedback. It's a core finding from cognitive science. In the absence of feedback, Santi, one gets more and more confident, but actually not more capable. It's a really interesting human effect, like a human flaw of judgment. So yes, any feedback we can provide to our policymakers is going to make them more capable. I hate to do this, but I'm going to contest the framing. I don't know if the organization does want to learn from failure. I'm not trying to suggest that people don't want to make the world a better place, they do. But when you really look at the incentive structures and the behaviors of the organization, there's really not a lot of space for people to accept failure, or to admit that the policy didn't work. Now, the Departmen"

We think these stories are a great opportunity to get a closer look at what we mean by \u201cstate capacity.\u201d Massive stateside bureaucracies attempted to build new, stable institutions in foreign countries. How did those bureaucracies perform? How about the institutions we built abroad? Last week, we talked to a former CIA chief of base in Afghanistan, about CIA operations and why signals intelligence is overused. How to Run a CIA Base in Afghanistan Santi Ruiz \u00b7 March 13, 2024 Read full story In today\u2019s installment, we talk to Alex Dehgan about his time in Iraq, as Science Advisor for the Bureau of Near East Affairs, and as Chief Scientist at USAID . What makes a good fixer? How do you manage a $2 million program in cash? How did the U.S. build a virtual science library for Iraq? For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: I was set to become an academic and teach at the Yale School of the Environment. I'd spent three years doing fieldwork in a tent in Madagascar trying to understand extinction, and was looking at houses in New Haven. Three days after I came back from Madagascar, 9/11 happened. I realized at that point that I needed to do something that involved service and engagement. Through a fellowship with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), I joined the State Department. I had my pick of positions, but the science advisor\u2019s secretary directed me to work on the Middle East because he was like, \u201cThat's where the action is. That's where you need to be.\u201d There was an immediate opportunity to go to Iraq to redirect former weapons scientists, a program which at that time was run by the Department of Defense (DOD) as a representative of the State Department. I wasn't looking for the weapons. My job was to take the knowledge of the scientists and put it toward rebuilding the country. I was an extinction biologist at the time, not an expert on nuclear, chemical, biological, or delivery systems, which is what these scientists were. I didn't have a great set of data on the people we were supposed to be talking to. But I did know that if you were going to redirect someone, you had to have a vessel to redirect them into. That meant rebuilding the civilian science community that had been destroyed by Saddam Hussein and 30 years of wars, sanctions and everything else. At that time, there was real animosity between [ Secretary of State ] Colin Powell and [ Secretary of Defense ] Donald Rumsfeld . And when I got to Iraq, there was not a lot of interest in supporting the State Department programs that were on the ground. You had to be really entrepreneurial to make this thing work. I think it's just fundamentally about access to power and control. Billions of dollars were going into Iraq. The United States had set up the sovereign government, which was controlled by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). It was the first time we had done that since taking over Japan , and there was an enormous amount of hubris in our actions. In fact, there was this feeling that we would never hand Iraq back. When I first got there, I was living in Saddam Hussein's pool house. I later moved to what I think was his ballroom, where I lived with hundreds of other people in double sets of bunk beds. We showered in a trailer that was outside the palace and tried to make things work. I had a document from Colin Powell that gave me apparent authority to execute this program to redirect former scientists. And I had $2 million, which we were quickly able to turn into $62 million to rebuild science. At that time, the DoD wasn't supportive of the program. They would not help us and we had no access to the infrastructure that was there, so we had to figure out how to execute on our own. Even getting things like cars from Halliburton was difficult: they had a rule at the time that you had to drive around white unarmoured Suburbans with Texas plates that had to be washed every week. And that was just insane because that was the surest way to get killed. So we went out to the open car market. I had also met some journalists from the Christian Science Monitor , and they were like, \u201cOh, you need a fixer.\u201d I got introduced to the fixer who had been working for the New York Times and I hired him on the spot. And then we went into the Baghdad car market where, you know, in the first three days of the war, something like 100,000 cars entered the country. No one knew how to drive, a lot of people didn't have access to cars unless you had Saddam's permission. People who had never driven cars before were crashing into each other. We bought a car and decorated with local style. We put on stickers that said, \u201cI love Iraq,\u201d put on the air freshener with the plastic half pulled off, and started working on figuring out who the scientists were and who we were supposed to work with. I think it's this ability to find whatever resources you need and be able to get there and support the person. You're putting your life in their hands, so there has to be camaraderie and trust between you. We needed the fixer to have networks that we could tap into. We set up a science center outside of the Green Zone because that's where the scientists were and we had to set up our own security force to protect it. We had to get weapons. We had to get supplies and do procurement. The fixer needed to be scrappy and have the networks and be able to maintain the security of the project. I think the second requirement is being able to communicate. We were very lucky that this person spoke phenomenally good English. Eight hundred years ago, Iraq was one of the centers of science in the world. There was the Bayt al-Hikmah , the House of Wisdom, where great advances in medicine, astronomy, and mathematics were made, great works of literature created. But recent sanctions meant people didn't have access to journals, and the war, particularly the looting that happened after the U.S. invasion, gutted labs and institutions. Under Saddam, the scientists were in this situation where they had to produce biological, nuclear, and chemical weapons systems that have been used against others, such as the Kurds and the Iranians in the country. This was organized through civilian companies that were dual use: they could be working on both irrigation nozzles and rocket nozzles for missiles, and trying to do so in a way that escaped sanctions. If you were successful in making progress, you got cars and houses and resources. If you were not successful in making progress, your family was killed or you were killed. So the incentive was always to say that you were making progress. Some of the community had been jailed by the United States, some had fled the country, some were unemployed. The country stopped paying people. Part of the job was to figure out who actually had knowledge of proliferation. We interviewed hundreds of scientists, and spent a lot of time trying to identify who were the leaders who had the knowledge that could lead to a bomb, or a missile. We created the space for a science center outside of the Green Zone because requiring the scientists to come into the Green Zone would put them at risk, and we needed to build trust. The people waiting in those lines were targets and getting hit by improvised explosive devices and there was this lack of \u2014 how would you put it? \u2014 a lack of respect by making them go through the process of crossing that barrier all the time. We set up the center near one of the major universities. This colonel in the CPA said that we could have any palace we wanted. We asked, \u201cWhat happens at handover?\u201d And they were like, \u201cWe don't know.\u201d No one believed that handover would happen. So we actually went out and negotiated a lease to rent a house, but the State Department wouldn't approve the lease. Unclear. We wrote the lease up ourselves, I\u2019m a lawyer. The State Department lawyers didn't want to approve it, but they weren't saying that we couldn't do it. There are some lawyers that help you figure out how to solve problems, and then there are other lawyers that will only tell you why you can't do something. And they were falling in that category. So we actually found these lawyers within the CPA itself, one of whom became a major advisor on the Middle East across the Bush, Obama, and Biden administrations and is now an ambassador. We started working with those guys to figure out how to solve these problems, how to rent a house next to the university and set up the systems to actually be able to convene this community of scientists. I think there was reluctance, but we co-opted the intelligence companies and the DoD officials that we were working with, brought them on our side, which I think was very important. Then they started introducing us to scientists and providing us with the intelligence and the access we needed. It was so bad at that time. I was flying back to the embassy in Kuwait, filling up a backpack with $20, $30, $50 thousand in cash, signing for it personally, and then flying to Iraq and running this $2 million program, entirely in cash. I had a little receipt book and I was writing receipts for everything, but that was the level at which we had to operate to actually be able to make this program work. We had a very clear mission. We could use the authority of the State Department whenever the CPA was a barrier to what we were trying to do, but sometimes the State Department itself was a barrier. I think a huge problem with the Coalition Provisional Authority was that no one actually realized that there could be an end to our governance in Iraq. The biggest challenge was that we wanted to set up institutions owned by and created for the Iraqis. And so the first thing I did was convene a group of really good scientists who had been involved in the weapons programs and said, \u201cLook, here is the purpose of our program. We have these non-proliferation aims, but on the flip side, this is your chance to build civilian science in the country. What do we need and how do we do it?\u201d I started working with that scientific leadership to build a National Academy of Sciences , an Office of Science and Technology Policy type of institution for the parliament, and a National Science Foundation . We helped Iraqis get through the required non-proliferation treaties to be able to access science. And then when I returned to the United States, I worked on building things like the virtual science library for Iraq. Because of looting and sanctions and conflict, they really needed to have journal access. We worked with the parliament and the Iraqi leadership. Literally the very last thing that the CPA did, before the handover to the Iraqis, was pass laws for all of these science initiatives that we had created to stay standing. I think that outlasting the CPA and leaving that legacy in the next generation of leaders and scientists was one of the most important things we could have done. I was looking at a map of Baghdad and saw that they had a natural history museum and I was like, \u201cOh, I need to go visit this.\u201dI had worked out of the Field Museum of Natural History during my graduate program at the University of Chicago. So I drove out there with my fixer. All the collections that had been collected by the British and Iraqis were destroyed by the massive looting after the U.S. invasion, but the library at the museum was phenomenal. They even had a stuffed lion, because there used to be lions in Iraq up until the 1920s or so. But looters had chopped off the head and carted it off somewhere. The Lion of Nimrud, Phoenician ivory, looted in 2003 Physical hard copy library? Yeah, hard copy, natural history library. I found out that a group of female librarians actually put their lives at stake to defend this library and prevent the looters from going in and destroying and carting off the books. It was a really good library, but because of sanctions and conflict, it was 30 years out of date. So I worked with American conservation biologists, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists from multiple universities to collect full sets of journals that covered the last 30 years. We shipped the full sets and some important books from that 30-year time period over to my APO address [ Army Post Office ], my personal mail address. After the handover to the Iraqi government, I had to come back to Washington. I didn\u2019t want to, but I had technically been on a D.C.-based fellowship, and they were really unhappy that I had spent all of this time in Iraq. When I came back, I told the story about the library at the AAAS, and another fellow came to me and said, \u201cWhy don't we do digital libraries?\u201d Digital libraries were just starting to come online in the U.S. At that time, Iraq wasn't connected to the internet, except for maybe Saddam and his families, but that was starting to change and I was thinking that this probably could be a reality. Susan Cumberledge , a professor at the University of Massachusetts, D.J. Patil , who became the U.S. Chief Data Scientist, another State Department colleague, and I started working on building a digital science library to cover all of these fields. The first thing we needed to do was get permission. It was very clear that some of the freedom I had to be an \u201cintrapreneur\u201d within the CPA would be restricted under the State Department. It was very hard coming back from Iraq to an office that wasn't very interesting to be in, but I was like, \u201cThis is a good project for us to be able to do. How do we get support for this?\u201d One of the problems we had was the clearance process at the State Department. Most people hate it, right? They despise it because you have an interesting idea, you send it up for an action memo, and any interesting component of the idea is eradicated as people edit your document and your language. You send an action memo and there's a set of people who are automatically interested in being part of it and editing your document, including policy planning. But there are also lots of other people in your chain of command. If you\u2019re sending it to the secretary, you may also have to send it to the assistant secretary or the undersecretary's office. And then there might be other people in other departments of State who are not in your chain of command but also have interest. All of those people have to be on the clearance list. For instance, if I'm doing something on Egypt, but it involves science, I would need to go to the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs , the Office of the Science and Technology Advisor , and the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs and the desk officer for each and get their sign off. That list just gets longer and longer. By the time your memo is complete, all these people have had a chance to rewrite it, and whatever kind of novel idea you had is destroyed. And this is part of the reason why sometimes we don't see policy evolving in the State Department, because there is an elasticity through the bureaucracy that rebounds against novel ideas, pulling them back in. We were thinking about how to get approval for the virtual library, and we knew that people treat action memos differently than they do information memos. People have a lot of memos to clear. They're going to invest their time in the action memos and they'll sign off on these other memos. The interesting thing about that clearance is that it's an endorsement of your idea, and that really was a critical piece for us. So we decided to draft this as an info memo, which was merely, \u201cHey, Secretary Powell, we want to advise you on something that's going on.\u201d Instead of minimizing the clearance list, we had this idea to get everyone that could have an interest and maybe beyond that to sign off on this idea, and get it to look like the entirety of the State Department approved the idea. We sent it up to the Secretary of State, who we knew loved science and technology. He literally introduced the internet into the State Department despite the reluctance to bring in this newfangled technology. He just wrote on top of the memo, \u201cGood,\u201d and then his initials, \u201cC. P.,\u201d Colin Powell. We made a thousand copies of that page and of the clearance list and used that to convince the Defense Threat Reduction Agency that the Secretary of State of the United States endorsed this idea, along with the entirety of the State Department. We ultimately got the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, which was attempting to prevent nonproliferation, to invest in the project by giving Iraqis access to 17,000 journals using full-text, federated search, which was a new concept at the time. And we had negotiated with scientific agencies to get the journals at a fraction of the cost, or no cost. So we gave all of the scientific institutions in Iraq the ability to search all of these journals using a single search bar. That was the big thing, right? This is an agency whose entire job is to prevent proliferation, and we got them to recognize that building civilian science was a more powerful tool for that than putting people in prison or killing them, which was the approach that we had been taking. And that was part of the reason for this conflict that was playing out on the National Security Council between Powell and Rumsfeld. The idea was to just shoot or kill these people who were a proliferation concern, but we were approaching it with the idea of cooperative threat reduction. Cooperative threat reduction means you're working to actually reduce the risk. And in turn, you're using science as a framework to build the official relationship between countries. I had heard that this project, rebuilding science, was probably one of the most popular things we have done in Iraq. The head of the oil ministry was a nuclear physicist who had been trained at Argonne National Labs in the United States and he adored us for this work. He would not meet with the high level folks at the embassy, but when we came to town or when we would visit we could get any access we wanted. It reinforced this idea that you could be entrepreneurial to push for and build things you know to be right. But at the same time, this is also a really powerful tool for diplomacy that we could use. We partnered up with the National Academy of Sciences to help us connect with the larger journal publishers. There are a few scientific societies that are a little bit harder to work with, quite frankly, because they have one journal that they charge thousands of dollars for. The idea was to inspire people about what we were trying to achieve, to literally restore science to its rightful place as a way of helping rebuild an entire society that had been brutalized by Saddam. No matter what you think of the war, what Saddam did to Iraq and what he did to the Kurds and in the region was terrible. This was an opportunity to say, \u201cHey, we're giving a pathway. We're giving tools that the United States is deeply respected for.\u201d Even when there is animosity toward our foreign policy, respect for our science and ingenuity and technology is one of the most valuable things we have around the world. So with the journals, it was getting them on board with that idea and getting them inspired by the opportunity to transform a nation. And in fact, it became a model for other programs. We used the virtual science library to actually expand to other countries around the world, which was taken over by the Civilian Research and Development Foundation . The one in Iraq was taken over by the Iraqi government, and then over time their relationship with journals became normalized as in the U.S. It has essentially become integrated into the normal digital libraries that they had. The technology eventually advanced, but it was the key that allowed us to create a new generation of scientists, engineers, and physicians that could help wit"

How did those bureaucracies perform? How about the institutions we built abroad? Last week, we talked to the former USAID Deputy Director of Procurement in Afghanistan, about how money gets spent and misspent in foreign aid. How the Government Loses a Road Santi Ruiz \u00b7 March 6, 2024 Read full story In today\u2019s installment, we talk to Laura Thomas , a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) case officer and Chief of Base in Afghanistan. She has served over 17 years in national security and leadership roles. Laura was circumspect in our conversation, as you\u2019ll see. That said, she shared more than I expected. How a CIA station operates What kind of intelligence failure was October 7th? The holes in how CIA teaches tradecraft Why did intelligence agencies predict Kabul would fall quickly to the Taliban? For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: Imprisonment for me would be one, if I shared classified information. That's definitely something I'd like to avoid. I spent a lot of time breaking the laws in other countries. I'd really like to stay in the good graces of my own. The PRB doesn\u2019t change content and isn\u2019t trying to moderate criticism. They\u2019re trying to ensure that classified information that would threaten current sources and tradecraft. aka \u201cmethods,\u201d aren\u2019t out there in the public. Because it could lead to the arrest, imprisonment, and death of CIA sources, which would be really blowing it. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a review process. A base is a smaller subset of a station, usually in a different geographic area, but there's some nuance there. So a chief of base is the person who's in a specific field location making decisions and authorizing any CIA operations that are going on in that location. They're also generally the person that is the senior most interlocutor with foreign partners in that location. Other case officers and individuals in a base would report up through the chief. The chief also has release authority for cable traffic. Similar to the State Department, CIA sends cables back and forth between stations and to CIA headquarters. It's how information is processed, relayed, transmitted, how operations are approved, not approved. And release authority means you can hit the button and say this cable or intelligence report is going out into the wild, it will forever be memorialized. Someone thought it was a good idea and you have to stand behind what you put out there. One thing that's shifted over the last decade is just more people going out to the field than what was traditional. When you see the movies or you read, especially older books, it's all about the case officer. The case officer, or C/O, is the person that's out recruiting the foreign sources, aka the assets, what people usually refer to as spies, and that certainly still exists. That's still the forefront. The main thrust of what CIA does is to collect human intelligence, also known as HUMINT, from these foreign sources, and then analyze all-source intelligence, meaning make judgements on it based on information coming in from a wide array of sources. And the case officer is the person who goes out, targets those sources, says, hey, this is a person I think would have valuable information for the US government, but also would be willing at some point to share that information in a secret, long-term relationship. The case officer\u2019s day job usually consists of writing cables about HUMINT operations and writing up intelligence reports from assets that a C/O has recently met. Additionally, many days include meeting with other government stakeholders (State, Ambassador, Defense, Commerce, etc), as well as with foreign partners who are aware of our CIA affiliation. There\u2019s a lot of writing involved. Much time is spent on the specific wording of intelligence reports and cables to ensure accuracy and context on a source\u2019s motivations and level of access. For cables, that\u2019s what I call \u201cverbal jiu jitsu,\u201d because we have to navigate other Stations\u2019 operations, the government of the country we\u2019re in, other foreign governments in that country or interested in what we\u2019re doing, other US agencies who believe they should be consulted in advance or at least looped into the details of what we\u2019re doing, and so forth. We\u2019re constantly balancing all those equities with the need to move quickly. We have to move at the pace of events in the world. We\u2019re constantly judging whether we have the right balance of action, thoughtfulness, and legal authorities, all weighed by the results we achieve or don\u2019t achieve. That\u2019s just the day job. At night (though really at any time) a case officer is out hunting for targets, for people to recruit who can provide sensitive information to the US Government and meeting those people in various scenarios and finding ways to advance the relationship. Or they\u2019re out clandestinely meeting assets and debriefing them for intelligence that the C/O then has to write up and send into headquarters for further dissemination to the White House, Intelligence Community, and other USG entities. Other people in a base or station: A desk officer is a person that is essentially helping with the flow of approvals. You need operational approvals in order to recruit people, in order to do certain things. There are certain levels of authority that anyone in the US government has: operating authorities, you can authorize up to so much money to be paid out to this source or for this operation. But a lot of times you have to go back and ask headquarters for approval. Desk officers help with that flow, making sure that everything is happening on time with proper approvals in a base and headquarters. They do a lot of basic research as well, just to make sure that the job gets done. There are collection management officers, also known as CMOs. They're the people who interact the most with Congress and other policymakers. They find out what the U.S. government needs to know, and make sure that the case officers are asking the right questions of sources in order to answer those questions. They're also helping edit intelligence reports for source protection before those reports are disseminated to the wider policymaking community. We really don't want a leak of an intelligence report if it's so obvious that it must have come from this specific source, in this specific ministry, in this specific country. That\u2019s a failure on many fronts because it\u2019s jeopardizing a source\u2019s life. That would be catastrophic from a CIA standpoint, because the sacred obligation of CIA is to protect its sources. I didn\u2019t look at them like, \u201coh, they\u2019re just fodder, we'll recruit this person, we'll take their information, and who cares what happens to them.\u201d There's a huge ethical issue with that, but also a practical one, in that if CIA were to do that, who would ever want to volunteer to work as a clandestine source? Targeting officers are the officers at CIA who basically write the book on a specific target. They are analyzing all sorts of information coming in, whether it's signals intelligence (SIGINT), HUMINT, open source, and they're creating a profile of an individual or perhaps a terrorist group that CIA wants to go out and recruit a source from or within, and really helps the case officer think about how they approach an individual and perhaps where to find that individual overseas. They're extremely valuable. Great targeters are like gold. No. It's not to say that it would never happen. I've definitely had targeters come with me to meetings. It's pretty neat for them to eventually meet a target that they followed for so long, but it usually does not happen. I believe it's because of the war zones: Iraq and Afghanistan, just how many people were deployed to support those efforts. In a war zone, where immediacy is very important, as soon as you have a piece of information you're trying to pass it to the military for them to act on it. The more people who can help in a support function for doing that, the better. This is a very controversial thing for many case officers like me: if you're winding back the number of case officers, to make room for other support officers in the field, are you limiting the amount of information that you can collect with the core human mission that you have? And that's certainly debatable. Yeah. But I think we\u2019re more limited by bureaucratic risk aversion to human intelligence (HUMINT) operations on the whole. One thing that is so incredibly obvious, especially post October 7th: HUMINT has never been more important. SIGINT is great, SIGINT can be wonderful, but it only gets you so far. You really have to recruit a human that can tell you not what's happening in the moment, but what is going to happen, because they intuit the plans and intentions of a group. And you have to have case officers to go out and recruit those people. You can't just sit back and hope that SIGINT solves the problem for you. That's the easy button. The easy button doesn't always work. Yeah, absolutely. 100%. I think October 7th is an absolute intelligence failure on many levels. It showed an over-reliance on SIGINT, becoming enamored with technology and forgetting the basics, getting out and talking to people face to face. It likely also shows a reliance on foreign partners, and assuming that they have something covered and that we need to step back and just let them do their job. Yes, CIA is supposed to be the \u201ccollector of last resort.\u201d That's the moniker that the intelligence community uses. And it means you only recruit a human source to provide information if you cannot get it by any other means, and we don't want to risk the life of a source, or the case officer, if it's something that we could collect via open source, SIGINT, or diplomatic reporting channels. You get addicted to SIGINT and technology. I think that's a major challenge. There's a mixture of over-reliance on technology, reliance on SIGINT, but also just hubris. Thinking you know a target so well, someone couldn't possibly be planning something that you've not anticipated. This is not unique to October 7th, unfortunately, and this is human nature. We all do this in some aspect in our lives. There are training courses specifically for people handling sources and tradecraft training and methodologies. Some are tried and true and meant to withstand the test of time. So to speak with whatever technology advances occur at the same time. CIA is facing a real reckoning. It's called \u201cubiquitous technical surveillance.\u201d It's essentially that there's some digital record of everything you do nowadays. CIA is facing a huge challenge in how it operates because of technology. But there are ways to double down and use technology to advance operations as well. And obviously I'm not going to be able to get into that. This is a big ongoing test of the agency. Operations have to be much more thoughtful, it slows you down to a significant degree. I think that it reinforces the fact that you have to be incredibly judicious in choosing operations \u2013 who you choose to recruit and how you choose to do it. It should mean fewer human sources, only the most well placed sources, because you're running a risk every time you're running a human being. They're putting their lives on the line and it's not just the source's life, it's their family. Usually these people have spouses and children. Yeah, it was a small base in Afghanistan. Sure. So there were multiple, a number of bases at any given time in Afghanistan when the U.S. was there. Base covers a specific area: it could be a province, could be bigger than a province. It all just depends on the situation. And then the base reports up through the main station, which in that case would have been Kabul Station. Yeah, so I can't get into too many details on where things might diverge from the typical, but some bases are incredibly large and some of the most senior people in the agency, for example, would be a base chief at some of these locations. Also, there are some stations that are incredibly small that don't have bases within them, and it might be a more junior person that's the station chief in that location. It really just depends on the size, where it's located, what types of operations are happening in that location. You may have base chiefs who are more senior to station chiefs somewhere else. It's both. It's formal on paper. And it would be obvious to anyone who's worked at the agency for longer than a few months. And how many of the directives on what information to gather come from back home, vs from developments in the field? Talk to me about the priorities. It all depends on the situation and it also can be very personality-dependent. It depends on who is at headquarters running that specific group that covers your area, depends on who the chief is in the station or the base chief. Generally, if it's something really big and important, that's going to get the attention of the president or could somehow throw off relations with a very important foreign partner, headquarters is going to be involved. You want them to know if something like that is occurring. But it's all personality-dependent, except for things like financial authorities. That's pretty baked into any government institution. In a war zone, you're working with the military hand in hand, it\u2019s a very close relationship. If the military had come and knocked on my door and said, \u201cLaura, we've got a patrol going out today, here's where we're going. Can you tell us, do you have anything? Is there anyone you can ask?\u201d Yeah, I'm going to start contacting sources immediately. I want to help prevent an ambush and loss of life, obviously. That sort of thing is fairly routine in a war zone. When it's a little more formalized, if you're giving briefings in D.C. or at the more senior levels to agency heads, or individuals at agencies that run major portfolios, you get their feedback. When they read intelligence reports, they comment on them, and then a collection management officer would take that feedback, and they would generate a list of requirements to ask sources. And they would choose which sources could answer these questions the best and which are worth tasking with these questions, because we have to be so sensitive about all aspects of our operations. It's a constant risk calculus. Whomever they have nominated as the liaison. There's obviously a huge intelligence component of DOD, a number of different types of intelligence officers there. It\u2019s usually an intel to intel liaison. But it would also depend on the location you're in and how small it is. If it's something where I can pick up a rock and throw it from one end of the base to the other, and the military's co-located there, I\u2019m going to know all the military folks there and we\u2019ll all talk. It may not be the formal mechanism that one would find in a much larger facility. Not necessarily a win that I can talk about while I was at CIA, but one that happened just after I left that is very similar. I did a lot of work on exfiltrations, which we call \u201cexfils\u201d for short. This is when you help pull a source out of their home location because of a developing dangerous situation that you believe is going to result in their arrest and imprisonment or worse. And the ones that I worked on, post-agency, was during the Afghanistan withdrawal in 2021, helping get a number of families out who were U.S. citizens or visa holders or had family members that had worked for US agencies or the military. It's the same exact skill set, similar processes. I certainly didn't have any authority, being outside the government at that point, but picking up the phone, vetting people who are requesting exfil, did they in fact work for the military like they said they did? What sorts of questions do I ask to try and vet their story? In some cases there's a language barrier, getting through that language barrier and being able to communicate with them, helping direct them around Taliban checkpoints, which gates to be able to access the Kabul airport compound, because that was a huge problem whenever the withdrawal happened. It was just complete and utter chaos. There were a number of gates, people were trying to flood the compound. There was a huge concern: what if they flooded the compound to the point that it fell? Then you've got an even larger human catastrophe on your hands. Everyone probably remembers the visual of the military aircraft taking off and people hanging onto the landing gear. I didn't work there at the time. So I don't really know the accuracy or not. But it was no surprise to any mid-level person who served in Afghanistan that it fell so quickly, based on working with foreign partners there. For many of my colleagues who had also left, no surprise was registered with us at the speed at which things collapsed. It's unfortunate. This was a policy failure as well. We did not plan well and did not have ample time to get people out. This should have been well planned and implemented far in advance. And it's debatable whether we should have left a small force there to hold the country, to prevent the takeover to begin with. I served in Afghanistan a long time ago, so this is not knowledge necessarily from my CIA days, but just having served there previously, following the news, having friends and colleagues in Afghanistan. The level of corruption in the country, the hubris, to think that being in a location and helping prop up a government and trying to stabilize it is going to be enough to hold it against a force like the Taliban. That's what I mean when I say it was no surprise that the Afghan government fell. It was always shaky at best. You don't change essentially an entire history and culture of people overnight. Twenty years is short when you think about global cultural shifts and the rise and fall of certain empires. You can't change it completely. You can try from the outside, but it also has to be something from within that takes hold, too. After twenty years, it had not fully taken root. So then what do you do? Do you sit, you say, \u201cOh I'm just going to stay in a country for a hundred years or more? And I'm the person who\u2019s going to bring democracy?\u201d Again, it goes back to hubris and being realistic about what is and isn\u2019t feasible. Can't say exactly, but well over a decade ago. I think this is a perennial challenge of US policy in general. A lot of times we get involved and we have one idea of what we think the outcome will be and it morphs into something completely different. And sometimes the best policy is just hands off. At the same time, we're very much about human rights and advancing them while trying to balance realpolitik interests. I can't say what we could have done to make the outcome better. I do think that had we had a small force to stay in place there, it's possible it would have prevented the Taliban takeover, that they wouldn't have had the momentum they had, that the Afghan president would not have fled. I do think that we see some of the ramifications now of the withdrawal: Russia's invasion of Ukraine. When you get involved with a cause or take an action, you have to already start thinking about how you\u2019re going to extricate yourself from it, and what would the second and third-order effects of real or perceived abandonment look like. Anyone who tells you they can predict the future, I think that's nearly charlatan-like behavior. It doesn't mean you shouldn't try and craft the future to some degree. I'm not saying that intervention is never the right idea, but I'm saying it's often the wrong idea. Is that a recurring problem in your experie"

    "keywords": "This month, Statecraft focuses on America\u2019s attempts to build nations in Iraq and Afghanistan. We think these stories are a great opportunity to get a closer look at what we mean by \u201cstate capacity.\u201d Massive stateside bureaucracies attempted to build new, stable institutions in foreign countries. How did those bureaucracies perform? How about the institutions we built abroad? Over the next four weeks, we\u2019ll talk to people who saw failure firsthand in Kabul, Kandahar, and Baghdad, as well as people who encountered it at home, in Washington\u2019s own institutions. Nation-building in Afghanistan relied heavily on contracts managed by the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The agency oversaw road and school construction, infrastructure electrification, attempts to end the opium trade, and an array of other initiatives. Put bluntly, many of these initiatives were failures. Kyle Newkirk joined USAID as Deputy Director of Procurement for Afghanistan, managing a portfolio of infrastructure projects and agreements. In today\u2019s interview, he breaks down exactly why USAID struggled to achieve its grand goals. Are anti-terrorism funding provisions actually effective? Who takes on project risk? Why were rotations in Afghanistan so short? How did civilians end up carrying out active duty responsibilities? For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: You're usually located at the embassy, no matter what part of the world you're operating in, and you're broadly under the ambassador, but you\u2019re an independent agency there. A USAID location in a foreign country is called a mission, and you have a mission director, who runs everything and reports both to the ambassador and to USAID back in Washington. There\u2019s an administrative staff, and various programmatic offices: somebody who runs the ag portfolio, someone who runs the civil society portfolio, the economic development portfolio, etc. Depending on the mission, some are smaller, some are bigger. Some people wear multiple hats in that area. Then you would have a series of both local contracting hires, and sometimes one or two American direct hires, depending on the size of the program. So I was the junior procurement dude. The procurement director is the head contracting man or woman for the mission. That person usually reports either to the deputy mission director, or the mission director. The director is the head contracting position for the entire country, or in some cases a region. They would have one or two deputies. In some big missions, like Cairo, there might be more than a couple deputies, but usually the deputies would manage a certain portfolio of practice areas. You might have ag, education, and private sector, and somebody else might have construction and governance. Yeah, I was the deputy for all of them, at least at the beginning, because it was pretty small and we were rotating in and out. It grew a lot over the years. I was in and out of Afghanistan for about 18 months. My role was odd because I was responsible for Afghanistan, but my duty station was actually in Bangkok. I would go in for four to six weeks, with one or two-week breaks in between. After 9/11, there was a surge in demand for mid-career folks. I had been working on supply chains in the private sector but had wanted to get into the Foreign Service for years. Because I did procurement in my normal life, they had me come in as a contracts and agreements officer. After I finished my training, they told me about a short term assignment. I had to go to Afghanistan the following week. This was early 2003, about a year into the Afghan war, and Iraq had already started. I flew to Kabul on a UN flight, got picked up in an armored Suburban, and whisked to the embassy by some Blackwater guys. It was wild. We were doing quite a number of requests for proposal, RFPs. These were the typical RFPs you see for contracts at the Department of Defense (DoD) or State. There were a lot of authorities then for doing non-solicited contracts, grants and agreements, just because of the security environment. There were very few groups that had the capacity to work in those environments. So there was a broadened authority for those types of actions. When I was there, they hadn't yet started a lot of the direct granting activity with local host governments. There was a lot of money that was either going directly to the government of Afghanistan, or there was work on joint tendering with global NGOs. The money was flowing through the government of Afghanistan with approval from the U.S. government. It was very complex. It may be different now, but at the time, it was very difficult to find local contractors to assign direct contracts from the U.S. government. We typically gave the contracts to U.S.-based prime contractors who would then go out and find local subcontractors. KBR or Louis Berger or Deloitte would also post them on their own websites and email their listservs about opportunities. But a lot of it would happen via a local tender process. Some competitive grants and cooperative agreements were posted on grants.gov , and there were some inter-agency agreements. We would send money to the Army Corps of Engineers to do construction oversight, or to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the World Food Program , WHO , things like that. We also took some unsolicited proposals. I would say 50% of what I managed were contracts for economic development and agriculture with big U.S.-based contractors, guys like Chemonics or DAI . There have been a lot of acquisitions in this space so some of the names may have changed. About another quarter of the money I oversaw went to refugee resettlement and some reconstruction efforts with UN organizations like the International Organization for Migration and UNDP . The final quarter went into grants and cooperative agreements with U.S.-based organizations. Those spanned everything: building schools, which is in the education space but construction-oriented, building clinics, some agriculture programs, and Cash-for-Work . We also worked alongside the State Department on small-scale road reconstruction, to try to decrease illicit poppy-growing infrastructure, things like that. I think it's probably endemic to all agencies that were programming reconstruction money. As a country, we're not good at expeditionary development and reconstruction. From GAO-08-689, Afghanistan Reconstruction, July 2008 In all types of government contracting, the oversight really rests with the contracting officer and their delegated authority, the technical representative. When you multiply Afghanistan\u2019s size, the lack of security, and instability made it extremely difficult to do program monitoring. Sometimes there was poor initial planning. Say there was a task order to build a 20 or 30-kilometer section of road. Maybe it came in with pictures, with an engineering design. The Afghan subcontractor likely provides the geolocation for it. Then the prime contractor submits it to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) or the contracting officer for approval. It gets approved, the money starts flowing, you start seeing invoices, but because the environment was so difficult, there were many projects that someone from our government never visited. Sometimes USAID would say, \u201cOkay, we're going to give a bunch of money over to the Army Corps of Engineers to go out and check on it. They\u2019re engineers, we're not. They've got guns, we don't. They can go out and check on all that stuff.\u201d This happened in the DoD as well. But there wasn't enough capacity. The Army Corps didn't have enough actual active duty folks or reservists that they could call up because Iraq was happening at the same time. They ended up bringing in civilians from the Pentagon or wherever they could to fill active duty roles. I ran into people that came from the New Orleans Levee Districts and things like that. Everybody got super risk-averse. You had members of the State Department or civilians overseeing infrastructure, and if the reconstruction team did not have the military elements, the embassy would not approve you going anywhere because they were afraid you would get shot, kidnapped, blown up, and so on. Another problem was the really short time on station. You had civilians coming out on temporary duty station (TDY) and they were there for maybe 90 days. Even the DoD and State department staff, USAID, ISAF or NATO forces that were in theater were probably only there on, maximum, a 13-month assignment. If you factor in Rest and Recuperation (R&R) leave and vacation, out of 13 months you might've only had to be in country for 36 weeks or so. If you played your cards right. The location of that road would just get lost because nobody kept the records. There were lapses in oversight because so many invoices came in, they were spending so much money, and people would just pay them without the right documentation. That is a great question. The civilian side of the government often ends up following the example of the DoD in these post-conflict, insecure environments. Whatever it is that the DoD is doing, everyone else does the same thing. And they had set up a system of rotating units in and out. I think their perspective, rightfully so, was that this was a multi-year, multi-generational endeavor. This wasn\u2019t a campaign where we're going to Europe to defeat the Nazis and just staying there until the job is done. At the outset, after Tora Bora and running out the Taliban, they probably thought \u201cOh, man, this is a 30, 40, 50 year engagement.\u201d But unlike going to Korea or Turkey or a base in the UK, you couldn't go with your family. So they got onto this cycle of one-year rotations. They had a really hard time attracting civilians to these posts, so they would offer more R&Rs and they'd pay for you to go away for a week. There was a big annual changeover of people, and you were just relearning everything again and again. With USAID in particular, nobody ever won any awards in the government by making their budget smaller. We would just think, \u201cWe will be better next year.\u201d And, frankly, the Office of Inspector General ( OIG ) and Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction ( SIGAR ) reports didn't really start until five or six years in. And so you didn't have an oversight mechanism within USAID for somebody to go, \u201cGosh, this is just not working.\u201d So you've got the institutional trajectory of, \u201cIf a lot of money is good, more money is better,\u201d and nobody gets to the end of the fiscal year without spending every bit of money that they've got. Everybody was wanting to grow programs. USAID is unique because unlike the State Department, which has a fairly large U.S.-side footprint, USAID has relatively few people in DC. Most all of the staff is in the field. You\u2019re pushing through $18 billion in development funding annually, all of that is happening out there, and the infrastructure to actually provide centralized oversight in DC is lacking. The missions have an immense amount of autonomy in deciding what to fund, informed by what the mission director wants to push, and a little tied into who the ambassador is. It\u2019s all politics to a certain extent, right? Everything is really driven from the president down through the executive branch and depends on the administration. Everybody wants to show taxpayers the results, and they think, \u201cMore money will make it better and we'll be able to show more results.\u201d It\u2019s not big enough and it's not sexy enough for congressional oversight committees to really dig into. They\u2019ll bring the Secretary of State to the Hill to investigate foreign policy issues all the time. Hardly anybody's dragging the USAID administrator up there and saying, \u201cWhy can't you find the 15 roads that you built?\u201d or \u201cWhy did you build 400 schools that nobody ever uses?\u201d It\u2019s big money, but it\u2019s not very big money. Another thing is, it doesn't generate any domestic jobs, for the most part. It's not a base, it\u2019s not a weapons program, so nobody cares. Yeah, I think that is generally true of the government's approach to foreign aid, and probably for any region or geography. There's very little infrastructure built into a USAID foreign mission or an embassy to develop even a one year strategic plan, or a multi-year strategic plan for our diplomatic engagement with a particular country. We don\u2019t have a 10-year development roadmap, it's all on 2 or 4-year cycles, really tied to our election cycles. And because we\u2019ve been operating under a continuing resolution for the last decade, Congress isn't weighing in on what we ought to be spending money on. The decision making is not strategic, it becomes extremely tactical. The programs that get funding largely depend on whoever the ambassador is or whoever the mission director is. USAID does not actually implement the programs, it\u2019s a contracting organization. To a certain extent, whoever\u2019s the lead over these particular programs may decide, say, it\u2019s really important that we invest in horticulture in Bangladesh. And maybe the new person comes into the agriculture program and they\u2019re a small grains person, or a livestock person, and that\u2019s the stuff they like to do. Let\u2019s create some programming around that. Then they sell it up the chain. At the end of the day, USAID doesn\u2019t do any of the work they program the money for. We\u2019re either hiring contractors or NGOs to go out and execute these programs. All that USAID really is, is a contracting organization that tries to funnel money into things that they think will possibly affect American foreign policy. Often the linkage between the programs and our foreign policy isn\u2019t very clear. Every time you get new leadership, things can change. And the contract periods are not very long. You would have massive infrastructure projects that need to be done, and maybe you were given a five year contract. Usually the maximum term is a five year contract and maybe there's an extension, but a huge infrastructure program, like building a dam and planning hydroelectric, just the design phase, site selection, and permitting that would need to happen takes two or three years before you actually get into construction. So often when things don't get completed, it's because we're not actually taking a long enough view. Based on your account, this was not really a priority for USAID while you were there. No, I will say at least from a development practitioner standpoint, they are pretty serious about monitoring and evaluating development outcomes. \u201cDid this thing actually work? What's the pathway to success if we do something similar?\u201d I actually think the learning processes are pretty good and there\u2019s been a lot of improvement over the years in driving programmatic design to get the desired outcomes. Some of the bigger NGOs and USAID contractors actually have a really good track record of submitting a proposal that says, \u201cHere\u2019s what you should do versus the statement of work that you sent out, and here's why we think it'll work.\u201d And they have a ton of data from similar projects in other countries. When we shift priorities, like we did with Afghanistan, we have nothing to show for hundreds of billions of dollars spent. Weirdly, Iraq has been a better development outcome than Afghanistan, even with all of the turmoil. I think the programs for Iraq were a little bit better designed, and, to an extent, we're still there, and so a lot of the work is continuing. One example of an unbelievably successful multi-year commitment is PEPFAR . It has broad bipartisan support and has been amazingly effective. There\u2019s the counterpoint example: a long-term, multi-administration commitment to something. It was a moonshot but they used data and kept doing program refinement and over many funding cycles. There are several other things that could be as successful as PEPFAR. [ We interviewed Mark Dybul on PEPFAR's design in the first Statecraft interview. ] Yeah. It's true that the quality of the work that we got out of domestic contractors in Afghanistan, and in other countries too, was not to standard, and the oversight left a lot to be desired. The U.S. government sort of distanced itself by saying, \u201cThey\u2019re a subcontractor, that\u2019s the problem of the prime.\u201d They\u2019d claim to hold the prime accountable, but that was not well enforced. From GAO-21-32R Afghanistan Reconstruction, January 2021, page 16 Depending on the location of the project, your options for subcontractors were limited by whether you could guarantee security. You often chose construction groups or implementation partners tied to the provincial or local government officials, who in turn had other ties. The money that was allocated for security, a lot of that was being channeled back through the subcontractor. Once the money went from the prime to the subcontractor, it totally got lost. You couldn't track it where it went. There was, frankly, a tacit understanding that sometimes those contracts were what it took to make sure your project could go forward. Some projects moved forward in a passively secure environment because of the contractor\u2019s ties to the local government. That there wouldn\u2019t be kidnappings or attacks on the workers. Sometimes there would be property damage, attacks or theft of equipment. Nobody liked that, but what we were really trying to protect against was attacks on the workers, or kidnappings. We might have had 2,000 \u201ccash for work\u201d workers on a road reconstruction project or a school building project, and a considerable number of expats in the field. We spent an immense amount of money on security contractors, and some were eventually exposed for corruption . Yeah, it's the cost of ensuring security that got passed back into the network. We had all these anti-terrorism funding provisions. But if you signed a contract, you were personally liable for a construction firm in the host province, and there was no way that I could validate that they didn\u2019t have ties to some warlord or Taliban group. So as a result the money just went to them as a subcontractor, through a prime contract. That\u2019s a good question. The U.S. government has used the subcontracting model for a long time across many types of contracts, from DoD contracting weapons systems, to local industrial development, to helping pass money to women- or veteran-owned businesses, 8(a) programs , et cetera. So small business set-asides have to an extent always been embedded in US government contracting law. But it became more important in post-conflict reconstruction because you had to use the local infrastructure networks. You were finding fewer and fewer capable Western prime contractors, and you had to use the local infrastructure networks. There was a lot of practicality around it, because maybe only local subcontractors had the necessary equipment in country to do that work. But it did shield the government from some of the more complicated issues on the ground. From GAO-21-32R Afghanistan Reconstruction, January 2021, page 20 The 2008 GAO report on road construction talks about the Afghan government\u2019s inability to hold up its end of the bargain on maintaining roads, the DoD's inability to locate roads, and USAID's inability to fund useful road projects. Obviously it\u2019s easy for us to sit here now and say that nation-building in Afghanistan was a failure, but the 2008 report was already pretty damning. Why did we keep funneling American taxpayer money to multi-year projects that we knew were bad places to park it? From GAO-11-318SP, Opportunities to Reduce Potential Duplication in Government Programs, Save Tax Dollars, and Enhance Revenue, page 120 You're right. It was obvious that this wasn\u2019t working very well by the second term of the Bush administration, but they were so invested in it that they weren't going to take their foot off the gas. When Obama was elected, it became, \u201cIraq: bad war. "

    "keywords": "We published three tremendous interviews this month: How to Make Government Less Like the DMV Santi Ruiz \u00b7 February 7, 2024 Read full story How did you win over the Secretary of Labor? \u201cI have this artifact somewhere: I took a piece of paper, and I have good handwriting, and I wrote on the piece of paper \u2014 I very deliberately didn\u2019t do a Word document or PowerPoint slide \u2014 the three things that I thought should be happening at our agency, the Employment and Training Administration. I wrote the current state of those three things, in terms of what was happening both internally and externally with our customers, and three recommendations for things we should be doing differently, and I handed it to him when we were sitting in a car. That was pivotal, because he saw me as someone who was thinking much bigger than my job\u2026 and that I had some ideas about how to actually do it.\u201d How to Buy Stuff Like DARPA Does Santi Ruiz \u00b7 February 14, 2024 Read full story \u201cSome of the other agencies, when they operated on our behalf, used cooperative agreements rather than other transactions, because that's what they thought their legal authority was. Actually a lot of these agencies had OT authority, if they\u2019d actually read their enabling statutes. They didn't know what the language meant. You're talking about DOE: DOE had other transactions authority in its enabling statute in 1977, and yet Congress had to force it down DOE\u2019s throat in 2005. Even then, they implemented it in the most backward way.\u201d How to Speedrun a New Drug Application Santi Ruiz \u00b7 February 22, 2024 Read full story \u201c In drug development, making a thing that is plausibly good is much, much easier than making something that is actually, reliably, very good . Deploying drugs to scale requires that reliability. It\u2019s a very hard socio-technical problem. All the different kinds of regulatory requirements, quality management, quality control, etc., that could be naively identified as red tape or boring paperwork that slow down the innovators are actually there to achieve that reliability.\u201d Asterisk Mag published an interview on why it costs so much to build public transit in America. It\u2019s the sort of clear, direct, concrete resource we like to aim for at Statecraft . At IFP , my colleague Brian Potter wrote a major report on \u201c How to Save America\u2019s Transmission System .\u201d \u201cThe overwhelming priority of energy policy must be making it easier to build things.\u201d You\u2019re an academic and you want to make your research more effective?

    "keywords": "Alvea launched in 2022, and announced on its website that it was \u201cbuilding an engine for warp speed drug development.\u201d In the middle of COVID-19, the company planned to show it was possible to dramatically reduce the time from molecule to trials for new medicines, starting with a new vaccine candidate tailored to BA.2, a particular COVID variant. A year and a half later, Alvea shut down (for reasons we explore here). But before that, it became the first company to vaccinate an animal against Omicron, and proved that pharma companies can move far faster through the FDA approval process than they currently do. Today we talk to Grigory Khimulya , the former CEO of Alvea, about we can get effective new drugs more quickly. For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: Initially, Kyle Fish and I started an AI antibody design company to do early-stage design of drug candidates against new pandemics in weeks, instead of the usual years. Alvea grew out of that, in part. It was a four person co-founding team: myself, Kyle, Ethan Alley , and Cate Hall . This is really how we got our first experience of the pharma industry and began to see bottlenecks. In our experience, these bottlenecks are very common downstream of the initial discovery and design stages, and through the highly regulated steps, all the way to clinical trials. Alvea started in response to the public health emergency from the Omicron variant. It\u2019s been what, two years now? At the time, it was the most transmissible and immunoevasive COVID variant to date. There was lots of uncertainty about how dangerous it was going to be. There was a huge public health need, especially in low- and middle-income countries that were very unlikely, in our view, to receive updated COVID vaccines in time. This was also an opportunity for me to see what the later stages of the process looked like and whether there was a way to get to clinical trials and to do drug development much faster than it's normally done. This is where we've had some success, even though we ultimately made the decision to wind down . That's how it came together. Ethan and Cate came in that first week, as we were getting concerned about Omicron, it all started from there. If memory serves, we hired our first 20 or 30 teammates in the next two weeks. What I've been excited about for a long time, the problem we\u2019ve been solving, is taking a new medicine from design to human trials to results as quickly as humanly possible. This is of course particularly critical in pandemic emergencies. But it's really important in peacetime drug development as well. Every wasted month and year of development time off a treatment for a disease that doesn't have one is costing lives. What we wanted to do is design a very simple and scalable COVID vaccine focused on Omicron. Initially we focused on the BA1 variant, and then we pivoted to the BA2 variant that emerged a bit later. It\u2019s a transition from this very minimally regulated world of basic and applied science, where drug designs come from, to a suddenly very regulated world of human clinical trials. You go through all the steps required, including animal experiments that test the safety and efficacy of the drug manufacturing at sufficient scale to provide for a clinical trial. Then of course you go through the clinical trial itself. We wanted to try and streamline every part of this process to get this new medicine to patients in the pandemic and see how well it worked. What was your original theory about being able to streamline the process? Why wouldn't the pharma industry be able to move at the pace that you were moving? This is a really good question. I think my initial motivation was something like, \u201cthis is a really important problem.\u201d I think this holds true for most people on our team. We didn't necessarily see all the ways in which it would be easy or difficult. We just had a sense that this is something that could be done a lot faster by a dedicated team in a situation where the emergency is extremely clear and salient. We did an informal poll and many of our advisors were setting numbers like five years to go from an idea to submitting the clinical trial application to the regulator. Not even to running the clinical trial. It just didn't seem right. Of course, we were not the only ones who were thinking about that. Some pharmaceutical companies achieved tremendous results during COVID, including Moderna and Pfizer. This was an inspiration for us, but we wanted to see how this could be done as a small team from design onward. The way the industry is normally structured, there are drug design people, and there are early-stage biotech people who don't really think about the regulated stuff. They think about the science, they generate the candidates, and then there is a very inefficient, high transaction cost process where some of these candidates get picked up by big pharma and then developed further. Just to provide more light on what we discovered, I'm going to tell a bit of a stylized story. Obviously, it works differently in every company. But every step: animal testing, clinical trial design and preparations, interaction with regulators, and manufacturing, among others, is usually done by a siloed department, and many of them are done in series. One step gets done in one department and then it passes the gate and proceeds to the next department, but only after the first one has done its job. This can lead to the steps not being under a tight schedule, and a really slow and annoying process of actually assembling the regulatory package. Yeah, in the US and some other countries it\u2019s called the clinical trial application (CTA). It's all the documents that go to the regulators for them to eventually make a decision. [ Astute readers may remember Statecraft interviewee Dr. Gilbert Honigfeld posing with all 327 volumes of the clinical trial application for clozapine.] It\u2019s a summary, including hundreds of pages of supporting data for all different aspects. The FDA benchmark, the average time it takes to write this package, is four months. You've got to get all the departments together and they\u2019ve got to talk about it. They\u2019ve got to plan it out and then actually execute the writing. For what its worth, this timeline is based on my recollection of what a few FDA experts anecdotally said was the expectation, but I so far haven't found solid stats which are this fine-grained, and I would love to see them if they exist. From the start, we decided to do things a bit differently. Instead of doing this in sequence, in departments, we did it with a small, integrated team. And we did it in parallel as much as scientifically possible from a risk management perspective. Because it's a small team and everything was designed from the start to proceed in parallel to the final result, it took 48 hours for us to write the final application, instead of four months. I think in normal time, scale has a lot to do with it. In particular, it's the difference between working on many drug candidates in parallel, vs focusing on a single drug and running all the stages of the process in parallel. I think that\u2019s the best way to think about it. The latter thing is what in our experience gives you a really big speed boost. The approach that we've taken, and what\u2019s really been enabled by this integration, parallelization, and a small team, is that we would always be looking across all the stages and all the activities, and asking, \u201cWhat is the current bottleneck? What is the thing, right now, that is pushing back our delivery date of the clinical trial application and ultimately the clinical trial?\u201d Of course, a lot of these things just can't physically be done faster. Sometimes cells just need time to grow and there isn't a whole lot you can do about it. But in our experience, a lot of the slow steps are slow because of people, not physics or biology. We would basically focus the attention of everybody we could on the bottlenecking step and invest a somewhat unusual amount of effort into really going after it. So that's the second piece of it. If you were still doing this a year from now, could you keep that pace in perpetuity? My guess is yes, absolutely we would have. I think one thing that didn\u2019t lend itself to this approach was the early stages of drug discovery themselves. Our initial candidate was chosen and optimized to be quite simple and well-validated from a scientific standpoint. When, after our first clinical trial, we expanded into more speculative and challenging scientific areas and applied a similar kind of thinking to speeding it up, it turned out to be much, much harder. Early-stage, risky science is very difficult to do on schedule, even with all the best conceptual speed-up approaches applied: parallelization, contingency and bottleneck optimization, etc. The focus of our pivots from that point on was coming in on cases where the science is reasonably clear and there was a strong proof of concept: for example, in animals, which is still comparatively unregulated. That\u2019s one place where I think our initial assumption that we could speed everything up did not pan out. But as far as running through a new clinical trial goes, I think the approach generalizes. We saw that, in preparation for future clinical trials as we continued to operate. I think that was the most important learning. There\u2019s a meme in Silicon Valley circles about people who are really into moving fast and breaking things. The caricature is that the FDA is the enemy of progress, medical regulators are the enemy of progress, and they're slowing everything down. On reflection, I don\u2019t agree with that take, and our experience doesn\u2019t really support it. No, I just would see that conversation going on in a lot of private and public places, and I was agnostic about it because I'd never interacted with regulators myself. I could see reasonable people pointing to lots of inefficiencies in how the FDA and any medical regulator operates. No doubt things can be improved, but there are a few things that I've come to appreciate. What regulators are trying to do is actually really hard. People look at the drug development processes, and they notice that like 90% of the effort is focused on testing, verifying, and quality control, all these boring things after the creative, exciting part is done. There is a big difference between the hypothetical drug that is a formula or a design in the computer, and the actual drug that ends up in your vial. In drug development especially, making a thing that is plausibly good is much, much easier than making something that is actually, reliably, very good . Deploying drugs to scale requires that reliability. It\u2019s a very hard socio-technical problem. All the different kinds of regulatory requirements, quality management, quality control, etc., that could be naively identified as red tape or boring paperwork that slow down the innovators are actually there to achieve that reliability. Of course, when you get into the details, there are tons of ways this could be done more efficiently. But the fact that validation, testing, and ensuring that things are as they seem is 90% of the process is just the way the world works, not any fault of the regulators. My second conclusion is that regulators are fundamentally reasonable, scientifically minded people who want to do good things for patients and get good drugs to them quickly. We\u2019ve interacted the most with regulators in South Africa who have been, in a word, fantastic. In every case where we had a scientifically based opinion that some guideline was inappropriate in light of new evidence, they have been very receptive. People who have this critical take about regulators have often seen these guidelines that seem very harsh and uncompromising in how they state some process needs to work. But it's actually always a conversation with highly scientifically competent people who are capable of analyzing the evidence, hearing arguments and reconsidering what might be required in any given case. That\u2019s been our experience. Something that folks who are coming into it fresh may not think to do is don\u2019t take anything as gospel. This is advice I only really started hearing after getting to people who are some of the most experienced in the world at dealing with this kind of regulatory process. It's always a conversation. It's always a conversation about science and safety for the patient, which is very much in everybody's interest: patients and regulators and companies. It feels to me like regulators don't set their own risk tolerances. Regulators get blamed when something goes wrong, but don't get a whole lot of credit when they make things safe and good. Of course there\u2019s legislation and Congress to set standards, but it\u2019s really society, through the court of public opinion, that sets a risk tolerance threshold. I\u2019m really sympathetic to society potentially shifting the accepted risk tolerance toward getting more innovative medicines to patients faster. But that\u2019s just not a decision that the FDA makes. It is a decision that happens at a much higher and more diffuse level in society. It feels like an aspect that I failed to appreciate in my na\u00efve mindset before I went through the process, and that can be ignored by folks who are looking for a policy solution. There\u2019s an incentive set up by how the news works. There\u2019s much more reporting on very rare issues compared to achievements in safety in the vast majority of the drug supply. You have, on paper, some set of requirements. But those requirements may actually be negotiable? What's the process by which you negotiate that? The high level frame on this process is it is up to the drug developer to propose what kinds of evidence would be sufficient. Given the scientific literature and everything that is known about this kind of drug, what would be sufficient to establish safety and efficacy? What would be sufficient regarding a significant unmet medical need to approve the first human clinical trial? These guidelines are compilations of high level best practices and suggestions for a thousand specific decisions that you might make in the course of developing a drug. For example, you might need to run your safety testing in a certain number of different animal species, which of course is expensive and takes a long time. Correct. There are regulatory requirements, which are good manufacturing practice, good laboratory practice, good clinical practice, so called GXP, and those are much more serious. They're also much higher level and have more to do with ensuring that every bit of quality control the regulators have agreed on for these kinds of cases is there. But, in the case of guidelines, they speak much more precisely to the specific kind of drug that you might develop. For example, for us, this was a DNA plasmid -based vaccine, which is very different from many other kinds of drugs that FDA considers and has much more specific requirements for. In some ways, it does not need to be tested as extensively as a completely new, unprecedented drug because of its very long history of use in humans and many clinical trials that have come before. This process happens concretely, in your conversations with regulators before your clinical trial application is submitted. There are different kinds of preliminary meetings with the FDA, and the drug developer is in a position to propose what they think is sufficient to establish safety, consistent with what\u2019s normally required for a phase one clinical trial. Again, in our experience regulators are super reasonable and responsive to hard scientific arguments about why this or that thing might optimally be done differently. Honestly it feels like the answer is no. I'm sure there were small things we could have changed in hindsight about this or that part of the application to preempt a question or something like that. But not in a big way. The problem in our experience was really not on the regulatory side. The problem was with operational inefficiencies that run deep and fractally for every part of this process, and I think that suggests a focus for other efforts to speed it up. Getting operations parallelized, and speeding up the process of generating the data and arguments that would convince regulators, give you a much bigger bang for your buck than over-optimizing the regulatory process. There are common-sense things that we did that I would recommend everybody do, which are to work with experienced consultants who have seen a lot of applications and to proactively address ways in which you might be doing things differently from how they would be normally done. I think there are ways to implement the same regulatory requirements that lead to a very slow process or a very fast process. It's really in the implementation and prioritization, making all the pieces fit together very tightly on schedule, where you get the speed up. For sure. Again, the larger context of this is a normally serial process through siloed departments. The big changes are integrating the process, running it in parallel. On top of that, there is a huge family of bottlenecks, some of them funny, some of them just frustrating, that we ran into and resolved. In terms of solutions, there are maybe three different clusters of things. One is just using relatively straightforward software and automation tools. This is usually the easiest solution. For example, when you work with any vendor for a pharmaceutical company, almost everybody requires an NDA to be signed. This by itself can eat up to two weeks of time on both ends of this transaction. We had automated this NDA signing process so that it would usually happen in hours. Many of our vendors would follow up and tell us how insanely fast this was and how it was the smoothest and fastest contracting experience that they had ever had. I really don't have an answer for why this is not how it normally works, but we've encountered a lot of places where a simple \u2013 for folks in Silicon Valley simple \u2013 software and automation infrastructure was extremely helpful. Okay, I think part of it is the siloing between departments. The value of this kind of solution is much clearer if you are looking at the whole process and wanting to optimize the bottleneck at every step for a single drug you really care about getting to the patients as quickly as humanly possible. If you are running tons of these drugs in parallel through this sequential gated process and the whole thing takes five years, and that's the industry standard, then saving a week on the NDA negotiation side might not feel like such a big deal. I think that\u2019s part of it, but I will be honest with you. I don't have a satisfying answer to this for myself, and I'm very frustrated by it. I expected there would be a better way but I'm still at a bit of a loss. This is not to say that we are the only folks who are moving in this direction. Vial , for example, is one company that is working in this direction, not quite as fast as us yet. But this is not widespread by any means. Another big pattern is that, for some reason, for a lot of these key processes that really move the needle on speed, the standard operating procedure for the industry is to talk to maybe three to five different vendors, compare them across a bunch of categories, and then pick one and go forward with them. That never seemed to work for us. We would approach it by finding every single vendor in the world who does the thing that we need done, finding the best people, and then going in and very closely redesigning and managing their process for maximum speed. Practically, this involves parallelization and then bottleneck hunting in the vendor\u2019s process to identify ways to make it faster. A good example of that was the manufacturing of the drug itself, of the DNA plasmid that was our vaccine\u2019s main active component. Our initial quot"

    "keywords": "Government agency procurement processes are legendarily clunky. If an agency wants to acquire something, or ink a contract, it has to follow the Federal Acquisitions Regulation, or FAR . As a result, government contracting is far slower than private sector contracting. Federal contracts routinely go to the same narrow set of contractors, and run well over budget and schedule. But a few agencies manage to avoid this rigmarole entirely. Instead, they\u2019ve pioneered the use of Other Transaction Authority, or OTA : which lets them sign flexible contracts. Among the regular users of OTA: the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ), largely responsible for the invention of the Internet, GPS, drones, and the personal computer. And SpaceX\u2019s first deal with NASA was through OTA. Today, we talked to Richard \u201cRick\u201d Dunn , the man who brought Other Transaction Authority to DARPA. Before serving as DARPA\u2019s first general counsel, he served at NASA, negotiating the Space Act Agreement involving the first launch of a privately owned space launch vehicle in 1982. This is an arcane topic, but I don\u2019t think this is an overstatement: the best work the federal government has done with the private sector over the last 30 years has happened through OTA. Without Rick Dunn, much of that work might not have happened. As you\u2019ll see, Dunn believes far more agencies could use OTA far more often. So why don\u2019t they? For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: I had been in the role for about a year or so, and on my desk came a tasking from Congress. The House Appropriations Committee had put into the Authorization Act, a requirement for DARPA to write up a report on an alternative management system. The concern was really compensation for scientists and engineers: can you get world-class talent if you\u2019re paying civil-service salaries? We were going to do a study of that. I ended up being the primary government author, and we brought in a consulting firm to actually do the compensation part. By the way, I have a background in this: my LLM [ Master of Laws ] is in labor and personnel law. In any event, we had this tasking from Congress, and so in addition to looking at the issue of compensation, I took that opportunity to plug in a section that said, \u201cDARPA needs flexible contracting authority.\u201d Because we don\u2019t do business, or shouldn\u2019t do business, the way everybody else does. That report went through the Pentagon legislative affairs team and so forth and went to Congress. Yes. My role was unique. I had a direct reporting line to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and only a dotted reporting line to the Director of DARPA. I almost never saw the general counsel of the department \u2013 it speaks to the dysfunctionality of the way the Pentagon organizes things. I may be getting into too much detail about this sort of stuff. As DARPA\u2019s first General Counsel, what was the organization like when you arrived in 1987? It was in a strange state. DARPA had been around since 1958. For a long time, it relied on outside counsel as well as doing its own contracting. That\u2019s in part because DARPA wanted to stay a small, flat organization, and didn\u2019t want more administration and overhead. But that was starting to change. DARPA planned to establish a Contracts Management Office and was in search of a General Counsel. I applied for the position, a senior executive position, and then the position notice was canceled. A few weeks later, it came out again, and I just decided not to apply, because it seemed like the fix was in for somebody. But then the general counsel of NASA called me in and said, \u201cAre you interested in executive advancement? DARPA called, and they\u2019re looking for a general counsel, and they may be calling you.\u201d That\u2019s how my journey with DARPA began. When I went over to the interview, things got even stranger. I spoke to the director of DARPA, and as I was leaving, he said, \u201cI hope they hire you.\u201d I was confused, because I thought he was the one making the decision: who\u2019s \u201cthey?\u201d It turned out he was dual hatted. He was also appointed as the director of defense, research, and engineering at the DOD; he still had his DARPA hat on, but he spent most of his time at the Pentagon. The director had two deputies, one for technology and one for research, who appeared to hate one another. And the reason the personnel announcement had been canceled was that the deputy for technology wanted to bring in his fair-haired boy. But because it was an SES ( senior executive service ) position, the candidate had to go through an SES-quality review. They rewrote the position description to take some of the requirements out, but he couldn\u2019t pass that. So eventually they decided to downgrade the role below senior executive service. I was lateraled in as a GS-15 and eventually became a senior executive a year or so later. That\u2019s probably more detail than you needed to know. DARPA was located in Rosslyn, Virginia, next to the Potomac, in the Architects Building , which had actually won an award from an architectural magazine years before. It was pretty run down when I was there. DARPA had originally been in the Pentagon, and when it moved out of the Pentagon, many people thought, \u201cthey've really distanced us, we've been downgraded.\u201d Later, not being in the Pentagon came to be seen as a great benefit. It was a physical removal, but it also encouraged this idea that, \u201cWe're DARPA, we do things in a different way.\u201d Before I had gotten there, there was a question: \u201cThis lawyer, is he going to be just a contracts review lawyer, or is he going to be a general full-service counsel?\u201d My background was such that I was capable of handling a range of issues. My summer job during my first year of law school was in the Apollo procurement office at the Houston Manned Spacecraft Center. That was my first exposure to government contracts, and I won\u2019t go into detail, but the head of that office was a really slimy character. The government shouldn\u2019t treat its citizens, including its contractors, the way I saw the government doing business. In any event, I went on active duty in the Air Force for about 10 years, and then a year and a half in private practice before joining NASA. I was originally there as head of labor law, doing personnel work. For some reason, soon after I joined, I began to receive special assignments. I don\u2019t know exactly how that happened, but I went to my boss and said, \u201cBoss, they\u2019re not coming through you: they\u2019re coming directly to me.\u201d But one of the first assignments I got was related to Deke Slayton , one of the original seven astronauts, but he was medically disqualified and became Chief of the Astronaut Office . He had retired, and was associated with a group of people that wanted to pioneer private space launch capability. Slayton was the kind of guy who could make a phone call to the administrator of NASA. 1981, early 1982. So the NASA administrator then asked his General Counsel if NASA could legally assist a private company in demonstrating commercial launch capabilities. This was a private company that was not contracting with NASA, that didn\u2019t have anything to do with NASA. I was assigned to look into this, and wrote a 12-page legal opinion. I concluded that not only did NASA have the legal authority to assist, but it was also part of our mission to aid the industry in the utilization of space. As a result, I got involved in negotiating the Space Act Other Transactions Agreement launch demonstration. And what NASA contributed was rocket motors. In 1982, they launched a vehicle from Matagorda Island, Texas. It did not go into orbit, but it demonstrated all of the phases of putting a satellite up. There was a mock satellite on the vehicle, there was a platform, there were communications involved. They basically demonstrated that they could put a satellite into orbit. That was the first agreement that I was involved in, and I wrote the underlying legal opinion and then actually negotiated the agreement. It's worth mentioning why lawyers were so involved in this. At NASA, our practice for Space Act agreements was unique, especially for those involving \u201cother transactions.\u201d The procurement team didn't handle these. The lawyers did. We had a couple of lawyers who specialized in launch service agreements . These are a type of Space Act agreement where NASA provides launch services and gets reimbursed. Usually, when a government agency receives outside funds, it goes straight to the treasury. But NASA's General Counsel, who actually wrote the provisions of the Space Act, took the position that NASA had the authority to reimburse its appropriations. That started my work in Space Act agreements, and I eventually reached the conclusion that NASA was way underutilizing its authority to do this sort of thing. The Space Act gives NASA a wide-open authority. It allows NASA to enter into \u201ccontracts, leases, cooperative agreements, and such other transactions as may be necessary\u201d under terms that the administrator shall determine. It's just an open-ended authority. Because Paul Dembling , the author of the Space Act, intentionally wrote it into the statute, and his view was that most government contracts are highly regulated compared to the world of procurement contracts. Contracts can be almost anything that two or more parties agree to. And yet the government finds itself limited. If you\u2019re the Department of Interior, you sell timber, but you have a special set of rules for selling timber and so forth. Dembling was interviewed for NASA\u2019s 50th anniversary, and he laid out how people would come up and say, \u201cCan you do a transaction like this? Would this break the rules?\u201d Eventually he wrote in the words \u201csuch other transactions as may be necessary\u201d into the Space Act, and that\u2019s how OTA started. NASA\u2019 first use of that agreement is also very instructive. NASA and the Department of Defense were interested in communication satellites, they had various programs going. One of them was basically to bounce radio signals off a balloon in orbit. But they also had another project to forward the message to the satellite, and when it comes around the next time, it downloads the message. Then a very sophisticated project, a communications satellite in geosynchronous orbit: nobody knew whether you could actually put a satellite in geosynchronous orbit. Then AT&T, Bell Labs , comes along and says, \u201cWe're working on this, but we have no way to get it into orbit, and therefore we need you, NASA, we need your launch capability.\u201d This raised a couple of questions. One, the government already has its own communication satellite programs. The balloon was actually in orbit. They'd actually bounce signals off the balloon. And the other two programs were in some stage of development. So, \u201cdoes it make sense for us to have a competing commercial version of it?\u201d And the policy question was, \u201cdo we have legal authority to do this?\u201d Because of the broad language of the Space Act, they were able to engage AT&T, and AT&T designed, built, and owned the satellite, Telstar 1 . It was the first privately owned satellite to operate in space, the first active communication satellite in service. It had sensors on it, and as it passed through the Van Allen belt , it gave us an initial understanding of radiation damage to communications equipment. It was launched in 1962. So less than four years from the time the Space Act had been enacted, there was use of this authority in this rather unique way, doing business differently. We were getting paid to launch things. In addition to the report that I wrote, one other thing that ended up on my desk was a letter from some distinguished former defense officials, the \"graybeards,\" most of whom had contributed to the Packard Commission Report of 1986 , highlighting inefficiencies in defense procurement. This report and their input helped me push for adopting flexible transaction authority at DARPA, similar to what we had at NASA. The Packard Commission pointed out that many defense projects were too expensive and took too long. This perspective came from people deeply involved in defense during the 1950s. Think about that era \u2013 we developed Intercontinental Ballistic Nuclear Missiles and deployed them in just a few years. The Von Neumann Commission report in 1954 was a turning point. It noted that because hydrogen bombs were smaller than the older fission bombs, it was now feasible to deploy ICBMs. In just five years, we were able to develop a fully functional ICBM. We developed entirely new systems in five years. So these fellows were looking at the state of defense acquisition in the late 1980s, and said \u201cyou guys are screwed up.\u201d They had written a letter that basically exhorted officials from the Department of Defense to try to be more commercial in nature, to be more innovative. That letter had bounced around the Pentagon, it was sent to DARPA, and ended up on my desk. So I drafted a reply which basically said, \u201cYou guys have great ideas, but we can\u2019t do them under our current legal authority. But if we had more flexible legal authority, we could do them.\u201d I\u2019d say we had a mutually beneficial relationship. The head of that group was retired 4-star General Bernard Schriever , also known as the father of America's ICBM program and Defense Space Program. He was the kind of guy who could call up Sam Nunn , then chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Schriever briefed what he was interested in, and there was this guy at DARPA attending. About a week later, the deputy director who had been my advocate in the hiring process had a meeting with Sam Nunn, and Nunn said, \u201cHey, these graybeards came in and they started talking to me about this stuff. What\u2019s the deal?\u201d And the deputy director said, \u201cmy general counsel knows.\u201d Senator Nunn replied, \u201cI\u2019ll have my guy call your guy.\u201d Nine months later, Other Transaction Authority was law. But it wasn't smooth sailing. It wasn't just the Senate. We had to get through the House and there were people that raised objections. Ultimately, I backed off and said, \u201cWe're only going to do this for research, it's limited to DARPA,\u201d and so forth. And that was later expanded. Absolutely. My idea from the beginning was a full-scale alternative to the acquisition system. So we would start with research, prototyping, and then the whole shebang. There are fewer budget implications. It's not everything, it\u2019s just one place, and it was DARPA-specific. It didn't look like it was goring anybody's ox. I was consulted. I don\u2019t think I pushed that per se. I drafted the prototype authority language. I\u2019m not sure where to start\u2026 It got the director of DARPA fired. The first OT was with a venture-capital supported firm that was doing work in gallium arsenide . The authority was enacted in 1989, and the first agreement was signed in April of 1990, with a startup that had about three rounds of venture capital support, about $12 million, and they were developing chips with gallium arsenide instead of silicon, and there was some defense interest in that. Politically, what was going on at that time, of course, was the Cold War was ending, and there was this question of what the government's involvement would be in directing technology, in industrial policy. Some people were adamant that the government should not be involved in industrial policy, picking winners and losers. I don't think DARPA conceived of what it was doing as industrial policy at all. DARPA was interested in enhancing defense capabilities. And one of the techniques for doing that was to have a strong industrial base in whatever the technology was that defense needed. And it wasn't just a technology baked with the big contractors, but a vibrant national industry that we were interested in, and getting beyond the narrow, kept cadre of contractors that DOD normally does business with. In any event we had this first agreement, which I've written about , was managed by Arati Prabhakar , who later became the director of DARPA and is now science advisor to the president. She managed the technical aspect of it, and I partnered to get the agreement negotiated. The agreement looked nothing like a procurement contract. It was about five pages long. The way she conducted oversight was she went out to California and sat in on the company's board of directors. It was just completely different from the way the government normally does it. Because we were supporting a VC firm, we wrote into the agreement that, if the project is successful and goes to market, the government will receive a payback, and the payback can either be a royalty on product sales, or the company's increase in value can be prorated to the government investment and the government will be paid. So there were options, but the point was the government could make money out of the deal. It had no products, it was entirely VC-supported, and we were basically acting as your next stage of VC , so we were going to get compensated in that way. When the company publicized it, it looked like the government had taken an equity interest in the company, and that was enough to cause a firestorm. There was a paper published in the Harvard Business Review that quoted Vice President Cheney [ then the Secretary of Defense ] saying if Dr. Craig Fields , the director of DARPA, stuck his neck out one more time, he was going to find his head chopped off. This was the occasion to do that. Of course, he was a senior executive and the government could move him where they wanted to \u2013 he wasn't fired, but he was moved to a closet in the Pentagon. So days after that, the Deputy Secretary of Defense [ Donald Atwood Jr. ] was before the Senate Armed Services Committee, and they said, \u201cWhat did you do with Dr. Craig Fields, and what's going on with this agreement with this little company?\u201d Apparently the people in the Pentagon believed that we at DARPA had gone off the deep end and done this all on our own. Actually, we had gone over and briefed the undersecretary of defense for R&D ahead of time [ Charles M. Herzfeld , who had previously been Director of DARPA and authorized the creation of ARPANET, the Internet\u2019s predecessor ]. I said we were thinking about starting a small OTA experiment and working up from there, and he said, \u201cCongress gave me this authority and they meant for you to use it, so you go ahead with this agreement.\u201d But Herzfeld was out of the country when this hit the newspapers. There was no one available to say, \u201cHey, a senior person signed off on this.\u201d So when the Deputy Secretary got before Congress, he of course denied that Fields had been fired. They said he\u2019d been reassigned, he\u2019d been given a new opportunity. Fine. But they required all future agreements to be run through the director of procurement and acquisition policy, who knew nothing about non-procurement agreements. We were really slowed down for a year and a half until the administration changed. The last senior \u201c advice and consent \u201d official who was in place was another former director of DARPA, and he told the procurement folks, \u201cYou\u2019re no longer reviewing DARPA procurement.\u201d Sorry to get into all this detail. OTA at DARPA is clearly seen as a success, right? In that OTA has been rolled out to other agencies, parts of DOE, the CHIPS Act deployment . How long did it take for other transactions to become widely recognized as a useful tool? As I said, we went into a hiatus in early 1990. We got to 1992 with very little action going on. There were only a few agreements, and people started bailing out of the department after the election. And Congress got involved: again, we\u2019re at the end of the Cold War, defense is downsizing, acquisition budget is shrinking. Defense firms are under stress. People start thinking that although DOD is really technically advanced, the nation is going to lose that technical advantage, it\u2019s going to atrophy. So Congre"

In popular culture, they\u2019re second only to the DMV for their anti-human qualities. But they don\u2019t have to be this way. Virginia Hamilton led the deployment of human-centered design in the Department of Labor (DOL), introducing Apple Store-style customer focus and helping the 17,000-person organization run more efficiently. This helped DOL-funded programs and offices, such as American Jobs Centers, more effectively support those seeking employment assistance. Promotional images from an American Job Center in Guam What You\u2019ll Learn What might good handwriting win you? What is institutional body language, and how do you fix it? How does risk-taking make an organization more risk-tolerant? How do you run a 52-person board meeting effectively? Hamilton worked as a regional administrator for the Department of Labor, founded and directed the California Workforce Association, and was the Chief of Office of Workforce Policy for the California Employment Development Department. She advises on effective facilitation and design through her Make Fast Studio consultancy. For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: So I\u2019ll be a little bit more precise. The DOL has lots of different agencies within it, and I was in the Employment and Training Administration . My work was primarily oversight of the programs and grants that ran through that agency. Eighty-five percent of the funding goes from the Department of Labor down to the states. My region was eight states from Alaska down to Hawaii, and four territories in the Pacific \u2013 the best region in the country. Under my oversight were the unemployment insurance program, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act , which is a job training program, YouthBuild , migrant seasonal farmworker programs, and some smaller grant programs that sometimes went to the state and sometimes to local governments. By way of background, the Department of Labor was founded to catch bad guys. It was started after the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, when 146 people died because of lack of safety standards. Then, under Frances Perkins, OSHA (The Occupational Safety and Health Administration) was created, and then later came MSHA (The Mine Safety and Health Administration). Most of the agencies within the Department of Labor are there for enforcement, to catch bad guys and protect workers' rights. Ours was a grant-making agency, which is stuck in the middle of the larger operation. It took me a while to figure out why this was the case. The culture was very much focused on compliance. I had colleagues in other parts of the country, who had the same job as I did, who saw their job as making sure that the grants were being run properly, and when things went wrong, writing them up to make sure they got reports into DC. At the end of the year, my counterpart in another part of the country might have sent in 200 corrective action plans. And I'd have sent in seven, because I felt like my job was to actually help the people running these programs do better and do them right. So if we got a call saying, \u201cI think we're in trouble,\u201d we didn't write it down in a report and send it back to DC. Instead we\u2019d say, \u201cOkay. How can we help you?\u201d Most of my job was working with our states, making sure that they were complying with the law, but also trying to help them run these programs better and provide good services to people who were unemployed. I came in at the end of the recession, so there were still all sorts of problems with unemployment insurance systems, as I\u2019m sure you read about in the paper. But I saw my job differently than some of my colleagues across the country did, if that makes sense. The big one is the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act . That program stands on the shoulders of prior job training programs that started back in the \u201860s, which focused on helping vulnerable populations and people who faced barriers to employment get into job training programs and then into jobs. I ran one of those programs when I worked for the state of California, and I don\u2019t know exactly how much money we\u2019re talking about, but at the time it was about a billion dollar program. The funding has gone down over the years. But it\u2019s a substantial amount of money which goes to the state, and then to local governments who actually run the programs. The good ones will have lots of partnerships with other organizations and work closely with community colleges, welfare departments, and establish partnerships in the private sector to make sure that the training programs are actually connected to jobs. So it\u2019s not a matter of just getting money and running a small program, though some are bureaucratic and just do that. The good programs really think about supply and demand in their community and try to understand how the labor market works. The programs that don't live up to their potential are run by well-meaning bureaucrats who get the money from the federal government, read the law, read the regulations, and do what they're supposed to do. They open their doors in the morning. People come in. They worry about their performance measures \u2014 they have to get a certain number of people jobs in a given year, keep track of how much money people are making and so on. They play to the bare minimum defined in the law. If you were to boil it down to one thing, the big differentiator is that they see the Department of Labor, and not the people relying on the program, as their customer. They try to please the DOL instead of actually trying to understand who is walking through their doors, who in the community isn\u2019t , and really trying to help them succeed in the labor market. In some cases they're getting people jobs, but they\u2019re not getting them that first job that will then help them move up the ladder and then following those people across time. They get them a job, and they can check that off, and then those people come back in again. Many of those organizations are very transactional. The good ones understand that in a given community, there's a growth industry sector, and they sit down and talk to employers and try to understand what skills they need. The best ones also work as an intermediary between the community colleges and employers. They say, \u201cOkay. These are the skills that are needed. Let\u2019s build a program so that we can get a pipeline of workers into industries that are growing and help people support themselves and their families.\u201d Yeah, they\u2019re the people I\u2019m talking about. So the administrative structure is that the DOL gets the money, it goes to the states, and from the state it goes down to local governments. The local governments have a workforce development board that oversees the local programs. All boards have a private-sector majority. The money flows through mayors and boards of supervisors. In some parts of the country, the Workforce Boards make decisions and guide the use of funds, while in other places, the government agency actually makes all the decisions and the Workforce Board is off to the side. Some local governments actually use their board to better understand their community and labor markets. But every workforce board has at least one American Job Center (AJC), if not multiple. Los Angeles has 14, for example. It is fair. There's a term I learned a couple of years ago that I really love: institutional body language. Right before COVID, I walked into one of the job centers and there were signs on the door that said, \u201cAbsolutely no food and drink,\u201d \u201cWe have a strict dress code.\u201d And \u201cyou're being videotaped.\u201d By the way, these are funky pieces of paper that are Scotch-taped to the glass. The institutional body language was like walking into a prison. A lot of our human-centered design projects initially focused on just creating a better space for people to walk into. There are some great examples now, but a lot of them are just government offices and look like welfare, or the DMV. I taught a class last year, and we had a guy from the California DMV come in to talk about what he was doing to improve institutional body language. The people from the employment department looked at each other at the end of the class and said, \u201cWe used to be able to say, \u2018At least we're not as bad as the DMV,\u2019 but that may be changing.\u201d At its core, human-centered design is a structured, replicable way to solve problems. In the case of government, rather than focusing on rules, regulations, and standard operating procedures, the typical stuff of oversight agencies, you start with what people need and what their motivations are. And so we're turning how government works on its head. Instead of getting the directive from the DOL that goes down to the state, that goes down to the county, that goes down to the AJC, and they do what's in the law, they're actually paying attention to who's walking in the door and what they need. When we first started doing human-centered design, there was an AJC which was trying to serve more homeless youth. Young people were walking through the door, standing around, and then turning around and walking out. The AJC asked the security guard to participate in their design team and he said, \u201cEverybody comes in, they\u2019ve got all their stuff with them. There's no place to put it, so they walk out.\u201d As a result of that insight from the security guard, they repurposed a supply closet up in the front and created a safe space for young people to come in and put their stuff. That's a great example of design thinking at work. It's not complicated. It's not a big fancy change of everything. It's just paying attention to small details by using the brains, heart, and understanding of the people who are on the front lines and the customers themselves. Again, I\u2019ll talk first about the physical space. I have a colleague at an AJC in Long Beach, California. In the parking lot for that center, instead of a sign that just says, \u201cAJC,\u201d (and they\u2019re called something else in LA anyway), it says, \u201cGood people and great jobs this way.\u201d Think about the courage that it takes for someone who's unemployed to just walk into a government office in the first place. They're probably at the end of their rope. To see a sign like that makes a difference. I have a million examples. Here\u2019s another: When I was doing this work at the DOL, there were four different nonprofits in Tennessee that were part of this AJC system. In theory, someone could walk into any one of them and get the kinds of services that were being funded. The directors of these nonprofits wanted to improve customer experience, so they went and sat in each other's lobbies for two days, just to listen and watch what was happening. On the second day, one of the women told me she went home and wept. Because the only feedback she\u2019d been getting from customers was from the people who were successful: \u201cI got a job, I got into the community college program I wanted,\u201d and so on. What she heard in the lobby was that groups like hers were seen as gatekeepers of information and gatekeepers of services. Like, \u201cWhy did Santi get a referral, why did he get a job interview, and I didn't? How come Sarah talked to a coach and got enrolled in a community college program, and I didn't?\u201d They had to rethink which problem they were trying to solve. As it turns out, the problem they\u2019re trying to solve is, \u201cHow do we become more transparent and communicate better to the people who are walking through the door? How do we help them understand why we're making the decisions we're making?\u201d Which is a really different problem than just, \u201cHow do we make customers' experience better?\u201d You're right. We don't do it in government at all. Or rarely. We always say that we have to treat everybody the same way, but the truth of the matter is that we never do. Even if it\u2019s the most regimented DMV. If they see an older woman who seems to know what she\u2019s doing but she hasn\u2019t filled out a form, they\u2019ll say, \u201cYou can just come right back up to me.\u201d People are always doing things differently, but we hold on to this myth of treating people exactly the same. Experimentation is always scary. Bureaucracy is designed to have predictable results, to do things the same way, to reduce risk. And here we are saying, \u201cLet's experiment.\u201d Since leaving the DOL, I\u2019ve been teaching design thinking to people in government, telling them, \u201cWe need to try stuff out. We need to develop prototypes and test them because it reduces risk.\u201d It's paradoxical that by taking these risks, we're actually reducing risk. For example, I was working in Detroit, and they realized that the people the customers first talked to when they came in the door were the least-trained people in the whole organization. As a result of our design process, we created what they called a \u201cfront desk academy.\u201d We didn't design and develop the whole curriculum. We simply put together a one-page Word document that said, \u201cThis is what the front desk academy is going to look like, here's the content, here's when we're going to do it, and here's how we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d We just made the prototype, handed it to people at the front desk and to their managers. It made a difference, and it was a lot less risky than implementing it, which we often do as well. Often, some politician in Sacramento or DC says, \u201cI think we should do X,\u201d and then we just go do it. But we\u2019ve never actually run it past someone who is actually going to receive those services. That leads to failure, or if it doesn\u2019t work for staff, they\u2019ll create workarounds, or just not do it at all. Totally. I was protected in a number of ways. I was working with IDEO , and they said, \u201cWe're doing amazing stuff out here, Let's go talk to the people in DC.\u201d And I'm like, \u201cDon't talk to anyone in DC because they will shut this s*** down.\u201d I stayed under the radar for a long time. I was also able to build a relationship with Tom Perez , the U.S. Secretary of Labor at the time, who protected me. He also wanted to improve DOL\u2019s capacity for innovation, created an Innovation Council, and made me the Chair. The first trip he took as Secretary of Labor was when the federal government was rolling out HealthCare.gov . He wanted to go to an American Job Center in Nevada and see how people were getting information about HealthCare.gov from different government agencies, including the AJCs. Because when people are unemployed, obviously, particularly in the United States, your health care is attached to your employment. I met him there in Nevada. I'm chatty and friendly and we hit it off. When he would come to California he would occasionally take me on some of his trips to different job training organizations. I decided that I wanted to do more than just my regular job, and I really wanted to leave a legacy. I have this artifact somewhere: I took a piece of paper, and I have good handwriting, and I wrote on the piece of paper \u2014 I very deliberately didn\u2019t do a Word document or PowerPoint slide \u2014 the three things that I thought should be happening at our agency, the Employment and Training Administration. I wrote the current state of those three things, in terms of what was happening both internally and externally with our customers, and three recommendations for things we should be doing differently, and I handed it to him when we were sitting in a car. I think that was a pivotal point because he saw me as someone who was thinking much bigger than my job, thinking about the potential of our programs and about the Department of Labor, and that I had some ideas about how to actually do it. I teach how to design and facilitate good meetings. And the meetings at DOL were terrible. You sit around and everybody talks to their boss about what they're doing, and it's just boring and stupid. In self-defense from these meetings, I started staying overnight in DC when I would go there for work, and I told the people I worked with, \u201cI'm going to teach a four-hour class on how to design and facilitate meetings.\u201d It caught on. I taught my immediate colleagues and they told their friends. Pretty soon there were a couple of senior people from the secretary\u2019s office who came to the meetings. As a result I was starting to get tapped by the secretary's office to facilitate high-stakes meetings with stakeholders and to help different agencies, not just my own, do strategic planning and run better meetings. I ended up on a couple of tiger teams when things were going wrong. I have really good process skills, and at the end of the day, good process outperforms best practice. People have to discover their own way, and once they do and they participate in it, there will be buy in and they\u2019ll actually get something done. If you just lift a best practice from somewhere else and plop it in, there\u2019s no ownership. It may not work at all. Something that works in Fresno is not gonna work in San Francisco. And so I\u2019m a total process geek. That\u2019s what human-centered design is, too. It\u2019s just process. I'm from New York, and I'm bossy. So I've always been able to facilitate a meeting because I was always the one willing to stand up in front of the room. I wasn't scared of people. I was always facilitating meetings by the seat of my pants and instinct. When I was running my nonprofit, the California Workforce Association , I went around and very deliberately sought out different skills, methods, and ways in which people could run good meetings. Because I had a 52-person board of directors. Usually in our meetings, five people would talk. Then I would get out into the hallway, and someone would go, \u201cI was thinking we should have done this and this,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say that?\u201d They\u2019d say, \u201cIt\u2019s clear that only Fred, Susan, Lee, and Robert talk in these meetings,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m new, I don't want to look like an idiot,\u201d or, \u201cI'm an introvert and I'm never going to talk in front of 50 people.\u201d There are lots of reasons why people don't participate in meetings, and part of the reason is that they're badly run. But I discovered a set of methods that are about participatory leadership, about how to run a meeting in a way that turns your culture into a culture in which every voice is heard and informed opinions matter. It was. I worked for the state for 17 years, and we had oversight of these same job training programs that I'm talking about. And I felt like the local boards had no political power, and that they were being stepped all over by the state. So I quit the state and the program I was running and started my nonprofit \u2013 the California Workforce Association \u2013 with all the local boards. There happened to be 52 in California at the time, and they became my board of directors. I worked for them, with them for about 15 years doing advocacy, lobbying, capacity building, and creating a different vision of where the boards could go. I've always had it in my blood. I walk into a thing, a place, and I ask, \u201cHow can I do this better?\u201d It's just always been there, and I\u2019m not afraid of people. The first thing I'd say is that on my computer, I have a Post-it that reads, \u201cWhat are you being measured by and is it in the best interest of our customer?\u201d I think our measurement system and the workforce system cause really pernicious results. Because, honestly, if I've got to meet my numbers, and I've got a group of people who've just been laid off because of COVID but they have work experience and they know how to get up on time and tie their shoelaces, and I've got another group of people who come from intergenerational poverty and no one they know has ever had a job, who am I going to choose to go into my programs? I'm going to choose the first group. It creates these perverse incentives. If we really are customer-focused, human-focused, we're going to have to start to think about a different way of measuring in government. I read a quote the other day "

We don\u2019t produce great works anymore; we\u2019re a godless nation; we don\u2019t have a coherent vision of human flourishing, we don\u2019t inspire kids to become scientists. Presumably, these problems could have all kinds of solutions: political, spiritual, personal, psychological, military, virtue-ethical. But what they call for instead are aesthetic solutions. Subscribe I reviewed a book called The Conservative Futurist for The Dispatch last week, which is basically all about this. In it, James Pethokoukis explains that certain types of content are \u201cUp Wing.\u201d That is, they share his aesthetic sensibility and inculcate an optimism about the future. Things like Star Trek and the TV show For All Mankind are Up Wing. I\u2019ve been stuck on this example, because it\u2019s a key throughline of the book: if people would make more consciously ideological art of a certain mode, that ideology would perform better in the realm of public opinion. From the review : \u201cRather than spend much time arguing with today\u2019s Luddites, Pethokoukis calls for the creation of inspiring Up Wing content that will win their hearts. American society was better when it produced and consumed cultural products that were optimistic about the future, and is worse now that it produces and consumes apocalyptic, dystopian imaginary futures. He calls for \u201cUp Wingers with resources to directly finance Up Wing cultural efforts,\u201d to fight back against a Hollywood which \u201crarely makes Up Wing content.\u201d Those cultural efforts could include more World\u2019s Fairs that showcase new technology, and a \u201cGenesis Clock,\u201d to counteract the pernicious influence of the Doomsday Clock.\u201d There are many funny things about this phenomenon. One is that consuming content is not traditionally understood as a fix to major problems. When a charity wants to \u201craise awareness\u201d for something by creating content, it usually means it doesn\u2019t know how to actually solve the problem. 1 What happened to Joseph Kony anyway? We increasingly see \u201cInstagram activism\u201d as meaningless. But what\u2019s wrong with calling for cultural production? People have always thought ideas matter! But classically, the way to push an idea into the mainstream is to do it yourself. Socrates argues in the agora, Paul preaches to the crowds, Marx and Engels write books. But the call I\u2019m noticing is always for someone else to create media that will convince other third party observers . What gives? One way to understand this phenomenon is as an inversion of the cancel culture instinct. In the digital age, the crowd is assumed to be endlessly pliable and susceptible to coded messages: this is, partially, why it\u2019s so important to stop this speaker from attending a conference, or that blogger from being hosted on Substack. The crowd is always about to fall for some evil contagion, and only ceaseless watchfulness can prevent the danger. Inverted, this instinct becomes a call for positive content; perhaps the crowd can be made virtuous by clicking through an implicit bias training, say. Maybe it\u2019s subtler, with a call for representation in media. Include the right human types in the content people consume, and the training can be implicit, sub rosa. When the Israel-Hamas war kicked off, young people began relentlessly commenting under Selena Gomez\u2019s Instagram posts. 2 In a tidal wave of comments, they called for her to make a statement in support of Palestine. Why did they do this? Wikipedia explains. \u201cSelena Gomez is the most-followed woman, actor, musician and North American on Instagram\u201d (429 million). It was understood that Selena has a media platform that other people care about. Therefore, she can influence those other people with her choice of media creation and curation. This creation of an imaginary crowd separate from oneself is very funny to me. Everyone demanding that Selena speak out is imagining some other group of people scrolling their phones and being led like sheep toward the correct stance. No one calling for memetic content to be created justifies it by asking for it for themselves. I don\u2019t need you to post the black square; they need you to. This is true even though often the askers are devoted followers and consumers of the content. Selena fans ask her to post, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs consume stories about cool scientific innovations. Pethokoukis is a super-fan of Star Trek . What these people are calling for is often simply the kinds of material they like consuming. Subscribe Why do we think media products will fix other people? Debord says it\u2019s because we live in the society of the spectacle. He says we\u2019re right to think about arguments in terms of the memetic vehicles that carry them, because that\u2019s our world now. Our focus is dedicated to content , to ideas that have taken form in public discourse. \u201cWhen the real world is transformed into mere images, mere images become real beings \u2013 dynamic figments that provide the direct motivations for a hypnotic behavior.\u201d So we\u2019re not wrong to think media conditions everything: in the society of the spectacle, it does. \u201cEverything that was directly lived has receded into representation.\u201d Another friend suggests that there\u2019s something Lacanian about the whole phenomenon, and points me to Zizek: \u201cthe subject supposed to believe \u201d is \u201cthe constitutive feature of the symbolic order.\u201d On this account, some beliefs are really more like lifestyles for us. We don\u2019t have the belief so much as we like the idea of living in a way prescribed by that belief. When primitive peoples are asked about some mysterious myth they have, about being descended from a fish or a bird, they often say \u201cOf course not - I'm not that stupid! But I have been told that some of our ancestors actually did believe that\u2026\u201d Zizek ultimately describes this arms-length relationship to belief as a feature of post-modernity. If it feels false or inauthentic to claim an earnest belief, try displacing it onto someone else, and enjoy it vicariously through them. \u201cIn an uncanny way, some beliefs always seem to function at a distance: in order for the belief to function, there has to be some ultimate guarantor of it, some true believer, yet this guarantor is always deferred, displaced, never present in person.\u201d Over text, my friend notes a strong instinct to moralize one\u2019s consumption. 3 I was struck by this: \u201cBecause we cannot stop ourselves from consuming content (we crave the stimulation, we crave the social access this stimulation gives us) we need something to justify the compulsive rhythm of this act.\u201d This is one answer to why the phenomenon exists. It may be awkward to say \u201cI like Star Trek because I like science fiction,\u201d but acceptable to say \u201c Star Tre"

    "keywords": "In the last month, we published four great interviews. One was on immigration rule making. Another was with former HHS Secretary Alex Azar, explaining why Operation Warp Speed worked so well. In his first years in office, President Biden undid many of the Trump Administration\u2019s restrictions on immigration. But with aid to Israel and Ukraine now tied to immigration in Congress, Biden seems poised to move his immigration policy to the right. How to Replicate Operation Warp Speed Santi Ruiz \u00b7 January 10, 2024 Can policy makers take lessons from the success of Operation Warp Speed (OWS)? As my colleague Arielle D\u2019Souza has noted, \u201cthe OWS model isn\u2019t a universal solution to pressing problems.\u201d But can we leverage specific features of it to prevent future pandemics, or cure Alzheimer\u2019s, or other national priorities? \u201cOn therapeutics, just from the history of dealing with monoclonal antibodies, we had reason to believe that we could create artificial human response through monoclonal antibodies. It became about brute force. Could you simply make things happen faster, execute faster than ever before? \u201d \u201cFor countermeasures, you have to say, \u201cIs there a commercial marketplace?\u201d I think we've seen with some of the recent announcements out of Pfizer that some of the antiviral markets maybe aren't as enduring and durable as we thought, but what's the commercial case that the US government needs to be involved as a guaranteed purchaser or funder of R&D to make that happen? Would it happen in the absence of government action? That for me is the first question. Because if it's going to happen without the US government doing it, we will only get in the way of it.\u201d Our most recent two interviews were about the CHIPS and Science Act, the major 2022 legislation that dedicated hundreds of billions of dollars to spurring semiconductor fabrication in the US. Specifically, we pushed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s policy director to walk us through how the bill became law, and then we followed up with the man Biden tapped to guide the law\u2019s implementation. We enjoyed pairing these interviews, and we plan on doing series-style installments more often. Focusing on the same topic from different angles improved our questions and made us better able to draw good answers out of our interviewees. Keep an eye out for more paired interviews going forward. In 2022, the U.S. passed the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, which authorized $280 billion of investment in a broad range of targets, including quantum computing, clean energy initiatives, NASA, semiconductor manufact\u2026 \u201cThere are teams of people dedicated to getting information out to senators. We process tons of complex parliamentary information every day. It often doesn't sound like English. So the whip\u2019s office and floor staff will translate that through emails and other forms of communication. There's a broad apparatus dedicated to just doing that.\u201d \u201cLet's say there are 100 unresolved issues at the start of a negotiation. The staffs will try to negotiate as many of those issues as possible, but inevitably there will be two, three, or ten that they need to, as folks would sometimes joke, kick up to people with election certificates.\u201d Last week, we spoke to Gerry Petrella, Chuck Schumer\u2019s policy director, about how the CHIPS and Science Act finally became law. But we were left with questions. Once CHIPS was signed, what happened next? How does the money get allocated to the semiconductor industry? Who manages that process? How are recipients chosen? Are these investments reasonable? \u201cSupply chain management is studied in business school because it often focuses on businesses, rather than in a public policy school where it might focus on a national government. I think that\u2019s a big difference. A harder question is, \u2018What are the best ways for a country to secure the supply of a particular input now?\u2019 To my knowledge, that hasn't been the central question in supply chain management.\u201d \u201c You don't want to get into a situation where you're competing with what's called the winner's curse . If companies are shopping for where to locate, they\u2019re going to try to get the best deal they can. If governments are competing against one another, you often end up in a situation where you're bidding against other government units... In the context of the CHIPS Act and these large grants, you have to make sure that you're not bidding against other countries, because we're going to pay more than we need to get these factories located in the U.S., and that will mean that we can finance fewer projects with a given budget.\u201d Biden official Ronnie Chatterji referenced an Ezra Klein op-ed, \u201c The Problem With Everything-Bagel Liberalism ,\u201d in his interview with us. In that op-ed, Klein suggested that trying to pack too many liberal priorities into bills like CHIPS and Science risked making them less effective at achieving their main goals: \u201cIt is very hard to read the guidelines the administration just released [ on CHIPS subsidies ] and see a serious effort to lower costs. The government is adding subsidies with one hand and layering on requirements with the other.\u201d Chatterji pushed back on this argument, pointing to the large number of companies competing for a limited number of grants as evidence that requirements will not seriously harm industry. But he acknowledged it will take time for the dust to clear and for economists to evaluate the success of CHIPS. Recent news items have suggested there may be trouble ahead: Both of TSMC\u2019s chip fabs in Arizona have had their schedules pushed back due to lack of high-skilled talent and high costs. Lengthy environmental review process are stalling other chip plants. At IFP, we\u2019ve highlighted how the same environmental review projects roadblock priorities like clean energy infrastructure. From the right, observers like the Manhattan Institute\u2019s Reihan Salam have argued that everything-bagel liberalism \u201creflects the priorities and nonnegotiable demands\u201d of key segments of the Democratic coalition. Klein responded to Salam and other critics here . This debate has been running for the better part of a year; expect it to continue as major CHIPS funding flows out the door this election year.

    "keywords": "Last week, we spoke to Gerry Petrella , Chuck Schumer\u2019s policy director, about how the CHIPS and Science Act finally became law. But we were left with questions. Once CHIPS was signed, what happened next? How does the money get allocated to the semiconductor industry? Who manages that process? How are recipients chosen? Are these investments reasonable? So we sat down with Ronnie Chatterji . Chatterji served as the White House CHIPS coordinator, directing traffic for the Biden administration. What does a war room of economists do? When do bills get White House coordinators? Industrial policy: what\u2019s the hype? How do you avoid international bidding wars? What happens when the money runs out? Aaron \u201cRonnie\u201d Chatterji A former White House economic adviser, Chatterji led the implementation of the CHIPS Act from the White House\u2019s National Economic Council (NEC) as Acting Deputy Director. Previously, he served as the Chief Economist of the U.S. Department of Commerce, where he was the principal economic adviser to the Secretary of Commerce. I think she's talking about my office, maybe, where we definitely had a war room mentality around supply chains. I had been in government before, during the Obama administration, and if you had asked me in 2010 and 2011, \u201cWho's the supply chain person, who does that kind of work?\u201d I really wouldn't have known who did it, or what the policy context was. Even coming from a business school, where I had colleagues who did work on supply chain management, I hadn\u2019t thought about it as a public policy issue in a comprehensive way. Depending on when you serve in an administration, particularly if you work on the economic policy side, the thematic events of that period are going to shape what your job is. In the Obama administration, because of the global financial crisis and the aftermath of that, a lot of my work focused on small business\u2019 access to credit. When I came back in the Biden administration years later, the big issue of the day was around supply chains. Luckily, I'm a microeconomist and I look at and talk to businesses a lot in my research. When I came in, Secretary Raimondo asked, \u201cWhy is the price of lumber so high? Where's all the steel? Where's all the aluminum?\u201d These things were important from a macroeconomic perspective because they were, to some extent, driving inflation. When we saw lumber prices spiking, we started to think, \u201cOh this is a really big deal. It's not just lumber, it's about the broader price levels in the United States.\u201d With computer chips, the fact we couldn't get them and they were short led to price increases and a scarcity in automobiles, which drove the consumer price index. Connecting the micro to the macro made supply chain issues the biggest challenge that I faced in the Commerce Department. That war room was basically my office with a bunch of colleagues, trying to figure out where these supply chains were, geographically and across industries, and how goods were being shipped from point A to point B and every point in between. The question for us was how to improve supply chains, increase their speed, lower prices for consumers, and have a positive impact on the macroeconomic environment. That was the war room mentality. I always knew a little bit about supply chains, but I didn't really become an expert until I joined the Commerce Department and went deep. Sure. In the chief economist\u2019s office, you'll work with other economists. The first thing you're going to look at is, \u201cOkay, what's the price trend? What's going on in a particular market?\u201d say, lumber. You first have to figure out which index you'll use to track prices, which is an adventure in and of itself. The great thing about Commerce is that you have people who are really familiar with all sorts of data across the economy. You have your colleagues at the Bureau of Economic Analysis , and they\u2019re best known for producing GDP and other key statistics. Then you have your colleagues at the Census Bureau . In addition to the decennial census, they\u2019re also doing fantastic research in a lot of other areas, including industrial areas. You're leveraging all those folks to figure out, \u201cHow do I measure this? What's happening here?\u201d Once you understand which price index to look at and whether it's going up or down, you start to investigate what could explain those price levels. As an economist, the best thing to do is collect a bunch of data and use empirical analysis to figure out what's going on, but you often don't have time to do that or a lot of data to work with. And so what you\u2019re doing is calling a lot of folks in the industry and trying to figure out, okay, \u201cWhat do you know about the market for lumber?\u201d And you realize, oh, gosh, there's a whole value chain starting off with the production of, let's say, resins. Resins are the glue-like substance that goes into oriented strand board , which is really important in home building. When the home builders talk about their materials being expensive, some of it is because the cost of oriented strand board is high, and some of that is because resin is scarce, and some of that is because the petrochemical plants that produce the inputs to resin have gone down because the pipes froze for an unseasonable winter storm. Oriented strand board What you're doing with your fellow economists is trying to piece together the story, put data together around it, talk to each part of the chain, talk to industry, talk to economists. There are also folks at the Federal Reserve who you can consult with. You\u2019ll then come to the Secretary of Commerce with an understanding of what is going on and what the government could do to make a difference. That's really what we're doing in a situation like that. It's small group work with quick turnarounds. You're often contributing a chart to a slide deck that will be presented to somebody making a decision. And in some sense, as the chief economist, you're making external presentations to audiences who want to know what is going on out there. Practically, what is that skill set? What\u2019s the specific knowledge or skill gap about supply chains you were missing? That's a great question. Okay. One is being familiar with the data sources. If you ask people what's going on in the economy, most people, economists or otherwise, understand where to get data on employment, where to get data on wages. You can perform variably sophisticated analyses, but there is a baseline understanding of what the data is, what it says, and what the data-generating process is. With supply chains, few folks had that expertise at the beginning of the administration. First of all, supply chains are connections, often between businesses, and they're often businesses that are located in different parts of the world. Some are public, some are private. A firm might have multiple suppliers for a particular good, and that firm may then send on their product to multiple customers. Some products are inputs into a larger integrated product, so it might be difficult to trace the impact of a particular, let's say, chip into an electric vehicle. Understanding all of the pieces of the chain and having the right data to answer the questions is table stakes, so we have to decide as a group what data we're going to use inside government. A lot of supply chain vendors have really exciting supply chain data analytics, and so you have to figure out, \u201cDo they have what I need?\u201d Some of those data vendors are optimized for CEOs or the chief of supply chain for a big company, not for the government decision maker who needs to think about the big picture instead of just a single organization. So you also need to figure out if there can be new products and tools developed, either in the private sector or inside government, to help you get more leverage. So one part of the skillset is being familiar with the data, and a big part of that is knowing who the players are who have the data. Often it's fragmented, so you need to be able to create unified datasets. The global scale is a challenge, too, because many supply chains, take chips, for example, run through Europe, Asia, and back to the United States. Once you solve the issues with supply chain data, you have to decide, \u201cWhat do I do with the data?\u201d Do I want to tell stories and have case studies about different kinds of supply chains? Do I want to do some sort of empirical analysis? What does that analysis look like? What am I actually thinking is the dependent variable and the independent variable? What questions do I try to answer? That's part of the skill set. And the last piece is understanding which tools government policymakers have at their disposal to actually make a difference on supply. Readers of IFP\u2019s work will know: we have many tools to stimulate demand. For example, we know that when we send stimulus checks to people, they might spend that money and goose consumption, which is a big part of GDP. What about supply? Are there short term things we can do to increase the supply of a good that's scarce, or can we only invest in the long term capacity of the economy to grow the supply of these goods in the future? That's going to create a very different tool kit for policymakers as they think about what they can do inside government. So from data to the right kind of analysis to what the policy implication is \u2014 that's what I mean by that new skill set. I think you're going to be seeing a lot of folks training up to do that inside our government and governments across the world. You're always monitoring, or at least I am, academic papers, policy briefs from important think tanks, even Econ Twitter, to see what people are saying, and you may get an insight or a tidbit. Someone on Twitter might mention some really interesting data about a particular port in the United States and how many ships are waiting to dock or what those ships are carrying. That's stuff you might not be seeing in the day-to-day data that you're getting in the Commerce Department, and those insights can help you message up to decision makers, \u201cHey, here's what's going on. Here's an example.\u201d It makes it real. There are also, of course, academic papers, which are published at an interval that's not really suitable for real-time policymaking, but are very important. I think where academics can play a strong role is framing the way policymakers think about issues: What are the key tradeoffs? What should we be looking for? And I would say in terms of asks for outsider researchers, how the government thinks about supply chains is a fantastic area of research. It\u2019s an area of economic policy that has been so important in the Biden administration, and one where the research base wasn't that strong, partly because supply chain management scholars have traditionally focused on a different set of problems, based on what I can understand. Now, of course, they're turning their attention to this in different ways and using new analytical tools that are fit for a different purpose. There are a few economists who've done this work in the past, but they weren't really focusing on the questions that we tried to answer in the Biden administration. Based on the experience we've had and my own work in the academy, my request here is to drive more research on the economics of supply chains. What is the policy toolkit for supply chains? That's really the big question that I'd like to see more academic research on. You do keep in touch with scholars while you're working at Commerce or the NEC, and a lot of the answers will come in the next couple of years through the research people are doing at universities and think tanks. A lot of folks would focus on a single large firm, let's say an Amazon or an Uber, and how they're managing their own supply chain or logistics. Some of the work tends to be theoretical, so we're thinking about how multiple suppliers might affect the reliability of a supply chain, really fundamental questions. A harder question is, \u201cWhat are the best ways for a country to secure the supply of a particular input now?\u201d They could probably generalize some of the models they have, but to my knowledge, that hasn't been the central question in supply chain management. Supply chain management is studied in business school because it often focuses on businesses, rather than in a public policy school where it might focus on a national government. I think that\u2019s one of the big differences. When you're working on supply chains, Exhibit A is computer chips, semiconductors. Of course, Secretary Raimondo said, \u201cHey, you\u2019ve got to work on lumber. You\u2019ve got to work on steel. You\u2019ve got to work on aluminum. What about those transformers?\u201d All these different areas, right? But in the end, chips were a big driver of the supply chain work because they were seen as contributing to the shortage of automobiles that could be sold, which drove an increase in the price of used and new cars, and that was driving core inflation. So a lot of my supply chain work was devoted to chips. We convened a bunch of CEOs to talk about supply chain issues, and in the background was this idea that, wow, in the short term, we have limited tools to increase the supply of computer chips, but in the long term, we could actually increase the capacity of the United States and not be in this situation again. That's how I saw the CHIPS and Science Act: less of a short-term fix to the problems that we were dealing with then, and more of a long-term answer that would make America more economically resilient, and, from a national security standpoint, more safe. And so we were doing these things the ambidextrous way , trying to solve a short-term problem, plug supply chains, fix them where we can, but also trying to think about what to do in the long term to make sure that this doesn't ever happen again. Bringing that together with a broader group of people across Commerce was how I got into CHIPS. I wasn't only working on semiconductors, but I was one of a small group of people who were thinking about them a lot. When the bill passed with a bipartisan majority, which was amazing, they needed someone to go to the White House to be the coordinator. All of the other major bills that President Biden passed had one. My understanding is that came from President Biden's own experience \u2014 when the $787 billion Stimulus Act was passed in President Obama's first term, Biden was the point person on that. He realized that having someone accountable is really important, someone to say, \u201cThis is how government should be working on these issues.\u201d He had Gene Sperling on the American Rescue Plan , Mitch Landrieu on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law , John Podesta on the Inflation Reduction Act , and myself on the CHIPS and Science Act . Given my work at Commerce and my prior experience on the White House Economic Team, I think the pieces came together. And it was, obviously, an honor of a lifetime to have the opportunity. That's right. It passed and then we went right over and started on implementation. As it was getting passed, I had the sense that it was going to happen and made the transition to the NEC so that we could get started on day one. One group that you have to convince is state and local leaders, because a lot of states are also providing incentives for local semiconductor manufacturing. Why are we making these huge investments in an industry with manufacturing located in other parts of the world? Why should we bring it here, and why is it going to be cost efficient? Why does it make sense for America? Although CHIPS passed with a bipartisan majority on Capitol Hill, we still need to explain to a lot of other people around the country, political and civic leaders, why it matters. We also want to explain to the general public, \u201cThis is industrial policy in a way the United States has not done for a long time, on a scale that we haven't considered for a long time.\u201d We allocated $52 billion to a single industry, the computer chips and technology industry, which most people already consider to be a profitable segment. How do we explain why we need to do this? There's also a whole \u2018nother set of people on the academic side who say, \u201cGosh, these efforts to subsidize industry are always a failure. It never works.\u201d I think explaining the effects on national security to the state and local leaders, to the general public through the media, and also to academics who have been thoughtful about industrial policy, helps people unify around an objective that might otherwise seem controversial. Yeah. There are a lot of great points from people who are critiquing industrial policy. You have to be humble when you're implementing this and listen to their critiques. There are many people who are going to give you good advice, and some people who are going to criticize it for political reasons. But you have to listen to the folks who have good advice and are trying to help you do better because this is really high stakes, really difficult, and it hasn't always succeeded in the United States or around the world. Give me a rough breakdown of your time as the implementation coordinator. Where are you spending your time in a given week? 50% of the time is spent talking to the agencies that have the money that was appropriated from the CHIPS and Science Act. That means the Department of Commerce with their $50 billion, the Department of Defense, the State Department, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Treasury, which was responsible for putting together the investment tax credit. All of these agencies have an important role to play in CHIPS. They all have money. We have to make sure we're rowing in the same direction and that one side knows what the other side is doing. I would convene calls with them very regularly, multiple times a week, sometimes bilaterally, sometimes as a group, to understand, \u201cOkay, here's what's going on with the money, here's the program you're setting up, here are the staffing decisions you've made.\u201d That led to the other 25%, which is communication inside the NEC. When you're the belly button of a program like CHIPS, one of your big roles is to make sure other folks know what\u2019s going on at the White House. My job was to tell Lael Brainard , who took over from Brian Deese as the director of the NEC, \u201cHere's what's going on with the program. Here's how it fits into the other things I'm seeing in the other agencies.\u201d We had a daily meeting where they would give me the overlay of how it affects the Inflation Reduction Act and what the president was doing on supply chains and I would feed in the updates on the CHIPS program. We'd also have staff meetings at the National Economic Council. I'd also connect to the press team if there was going to be an event, or to our office of intergovernmental affairs to think about the connection to state and local governments. My job was managing all of those different angles, messaging and informing people at the White House, and taking that information back to the NEC. My colleagues at the National Security Council were also a big piece of that, given the relationship between chips and security. I was also the connective tissue between the agencies that were implementing CHIPS and the White House. If someone had a question about what was going on around science and technology policy, then I could say, \u201cI'll talk to Arti Prabhakar ,\u201d who runs that office. That's an important skill for this kind of job, knowing how the White House works. The other 25% of my time was spent on media and speaking to groups about what the CHIPS Act is and why it is important. Very much so, yes. That\u2019s a very smart insight. Yes, it was something I welcomed and embraced, but it was a pivot for me and it took a long time. There are probably many academics who feel this way, that if you haven't been dean of your school or run a big program, you may have latent management impl"

    "keywords": "Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and then-aide Gerry Petrella in 2013, Scott Applewhite/AP Photo In 2022, the U.S. passed the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act , which authorized $280 billion of investment in a broad range of targets, including quantum computing, clean energy initiatives, NASA, semiconductor manufacturing, and $24 billion in tax credits incentivizing domestic semiconductor production to diminish supply chain reliance on China. CHIPS and Science combined two bipartisan Senate bills: the Endless Frontier Act and the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), in a complicated negotiation that involved both chambers of Congress and a rarely-used conference process. In March 2023, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor that both the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act \u201cwouldn't have happened without Gerry Petrella.\u201d Petrella, a former longtime aide and policy director for Schumer, had worked for months behind the scenes to build the support needed for both bills. Statecraft talked to Petrella about how the CHIPS negotiation went down. What are the functions of the majority leader\u2019s staff? How does information flow in the Senate? Do committees still work, or has all negotiation moved to backrooms? For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: There are a couple of differences. First, there's inherently a lot more decision-making that has to happen to actually run the Senate, because the mechanics and scheduling of the Senate are in the domain of the majority and minority leaders. I operated on both sides of that coin for Leader Schumer. Because the Senate is a body that has to work, more often than not, by unanimous consent. Even waiving the morning business, which can take hours, requires all 100 senators to agree. Senate operations require the two leaders, the staffs they have on the Senate floor, and the political and policy staff behind them to work together on both micro and macro level decisions. Together, they decide which legislation we will actually consider in the Senate, and when and how it goes from just being a bill or an idea, to a bill coming out of a committee, to getting to the Senate floor. Both leaders have to be a part of that process, and usually very early on. The majority leader staff has a larger apparatus. By the numbers, the office is maybe double the size of a senator\u2019s personal office. The staff includes multiple domain experts \u2014 health care, transportation, environment, and so on \u2014 to field incoming requests, answer questions, and provide leadership, vision, and strategy. The office also helps the committees and each of the senators' offices, especially those on your side of the aisle, understand what's going on, problem-solve, and take the incoming. There's a lot of decision-making that has to happen there, so there's more staff and more involvement. I worked in the personal office for Schumer before he was leader, and it's interesting to see the differences. There are certain things you wonder about when you're not in the majority leader or minority leader\u2019s office, like, \u201cWhy'd they make that decision? Why are we doing this? What's going on?\u201d Once you're actually there, you're like, oh, now I understand. It's really a tremendous effort on the part of so many people, including not only the leader's office, but also the whip's office, the chair of the policy and communications committee, and the press and speechwriting offices of the leader. There are teams of people dedicated to getting information out to senators. When the leader gives remarks on the floor, someone has to write those. We process tons of complex parliamentary information every day. It often doesn't sound like English. So the whip\u2019s office and floor staff will translate that through emails and other forms of communication. There's a broad apparatus dedicated to just doing that. In the Senate, both the majority and the minority leaders appoint their party secretary. There are not many roles that the senators themselves appoint, but Senate rules let them select the sergeant at arms and their secretaries. You'll see the two secretaries, currently Gary Myrick and Robert Duncan , are always on the Senate floor, and they wear a special pin. They are in their own league, really, because the entire Senate has granted them the privilege of helping make decisions about parliamentary procedure. Those two secretaries each have a staff, colloquially called the floor staff. They're wonderful, brilliant people who work way too many hours because the Senate often does business late into the night on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights. They keep the place functioning. Under the two secretaries are usually a deputy and a few other staffers who handle particular aspects of the parliamentary process for the Senate and senators. They help introduce bills, file amendments, and prepare scripts for leaders and senators to read to conduct floor business, but are separate from the policy staff in the party leader's office. I worked very closely with Gary Myrick, who is an unbelievable individual and has been there for many years through many leaders, but our roles were different. My job was to figure out how am I getting a bill, a substantive piece of legislation to the Senate floor for it to be successful? That\u2019s a great question, and it\u2019s relevant to not just CHIPS and Science, but to the legislative process in general. The Senators are the key decision makers and visionaries for legislation \u2013 they set the path and call the final shots. However, I think senators, rightfully and smartly, rely a lot on staff \u2014 not just their own staff, but the staffs of the leaders and of the committees. It\u2019s almost too complex and too much volume for any one human being to handle. My former boss Leader Schumer relied on his team to help him execute the vision and goals he and the conference had. We helped with getting bills, ideas, and issues to a place where they could come out of the committees with bipartisan support and then come to the Senate floor. Staffers also help negotiate some of the more complex terms and policy issues inside of bills, like the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science. I think senators, writ large, do that. Let\u2019s use CHIPS and Science as an example. Almost every senator has an aide who handles technology, environment, and climate change policy. Some offices break it up differently by discipline, but almost all of them have staffers who handle technology and science issues. But then the Commerce Committee has its own suite of professionals who report to the Chairwoman and to the ranking member. Those folks are very technically savvy, and they are experts in actually writing statute. Oftentimes, senators will bring their ideas or bills to the Committee staff and say, \u201cHere's my idea,\u201d or, \u201cHere's how I drafted the bill,\u201d and then encounter the committee staff whose domain this really is. A bill\u2019s outcome sometimes depends on whether the Senator wants to listen to the committee. The committee will want to put their imprimatur on the legislation, or correct how you've amended the statutes in their jurisdiction. I would always advise listening to the Committee professionals if you want to get a bill passed. The Senate staffs are really the experts in many issue areas, and they help bring the senators\u2019 ideas to life and move them through the process. The senators help provide vision, clarity, and strategy. Negotiation with other senators, especially on tricky issues, also often gets boiled up to their level. Let's say there are 100 unresolved issues at the start of a negotiation. The staffs will try to negotiate as many of those issues as possible, but inevitably there will be two, three, or ten that they need to, as folks would sometimes joke, kick up to people with election certificates. CHIPS and Science required a lot, because it was negotiated over the course of almost two years. Schumer himself was the original sponsor of the Endless Frontier Act , which was one of the individual pieces of the final bill. He also helped negotiate the original terms of it with Senator Young and others, so they were very, very involved. The bill then went through a committee process where Chair Cantwell , ranking member Wicker , and others and their staffs said, \u201cWe didn't like exactly how you did it, so we're going to try to do it our way.\u201d I was on some late-night phone calls with Senator Cantwell herself right before the markup of Endless Frontiers Plus, which wound up being called the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) in the Senate, and then was signed as CHIPS and Science. There were huge dramas related to some of the language that senators themselves had to address, like the Davis-Bacon language in the CHIPS program. Senators Stabenow and Warner were involved, for example, and they weren\u2019t even on committee. There are always these moments when you\u2019re handling major legislation, when the senators themselves are very involved as it goes through the committee markup process. Like the amendment process, committee markups are held live and the senators are present. The staffs help them organize and make decisions, but the senators are the vessels to take the votes, give the speeches, and actually pass legislation. It\u2019s a symbiotic relationship. The staffer only exists because the senator has offered them the pleasure of serving, and the senator really needs the staffer in order to do the job. CHIPS and Science is an interesting example because it had fits and starts and looked like it was dead for a while. That one maybe more than any other examples of legislation, I should say. It's pretty unique, because it started out in the Senate as a large, comprehensive, and bipartisan piece of legislation. The House really didn't have input, and they reminded us of that very often in the first year of that Congress. It was contentious. Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats were not that happy with the way we did it, so the House drafted and passed their own version of the bill, called Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing, Pre-Eminence in Technology, and Economic Strength (COMPETES). We tried doing an informal conference between the two chambers, and while we were pursuing and passing this bipartisan legislation with the Republicans at the time, we were also doing some partisan legislating behind the scenes, which wound up becoming the Inflation Reduction Act. It was hard to get a real negotiation going with the Republicans on CHIPS and Science because they were using it as leverage over the Inflation Reduction Act. We tried negotiating informally with the House, but that didn\u2019t go anywhere. To answer your question about whether there were any unique parliamentary moves used, we threatened to amend our Senate National Defense Authorization Act with the Senate-passed version of CHIPS and Science. It was getting close to the end of 2021, and we were frustrated that we hadn't made any progress in our conference negotiation with the House. We were playing what's called a ping pong , which is a legislative term for when the House and the Senate amend one another's bills to try to get to a final product, rather than go through the conference process. We got the idea to do that on the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 2022. Leader Schumer told me to go do it. I thought, \u201cIf this doesn't work, let's at least try to shake something loose.\u201d So we threatened to put our version of CHIPS and Science on NDAA. The Senate Republicans and House Democrats didn't like that, so we were able to extract a commitment to do an official conference. Or at least that it then becomes a lot harder to get your own things in, because we were attaching it to the defense bill, yes. But out of that came a commitment from all of the leaders and the chairs of the relevant committees to form an official conference. Congress rarely ever does that anymore, but it is a real, technical vehicle for resolving issues between the two chambers. You know... it's interesting. You can't do anything in Congress easily anymore, and even creating the mechanisms to resolve problems takes time. Just debating the motion to go to conference in the Senate, without cooperation from the other side, can take days or weeks, and you're not even doing anything substantive. That\u2019s one reason why it doesn\u2019t happen often anymore. Another reason, which some people bemoan, is the centralization of decision-making behind closed doors. Because of that first reason, among others, the committees and the leaders just negotiate on a bipartisan basis and resolve their issues informally. It\u2019s essentially a conference negotiation without forming the technical committee. I\u2019m a nerd for procedure, so when we formed the technical conference committee to reconcile the differences between USICA and COMPETES, I thought, \u201cThis is cool. We haven't done this in a while, and we made it happen.\u201d The conference committee is required to have public meetings, so the senators and the House members who were appointed by the leaders on both sides all showed up and talked about how much they wanted to do it, but we still couldn't get the thing going in the formal process. Fast-forwarding to the waning days of Congress in the summer of 2022, the clock is ticking, we\u2019re trying to pass Build Back Better, and negotiating with Manchin. We passed the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the veterans bills, we had Ukraine pop up and were doing tons of bipartisan stuff, but this one budgetary thing we were going to do on a partisan basis was still hanging out there and CHIPS and Science, not born of that name yet, was still hanging out there. We hadn\u2019t fully resolved all of our issues with the House, but because we created the conference committee and the conversations had been going on for so long, an understanding formed of what often is referred to in the halls of Congress as the \u201clowest common denominator.\u201d In Congress, that means, \u201cWe can't resolve all of the issues we\u2019re fighting about, but what can we all agree to on a bipartisan basis? We can't resolve all of the issues we\u2019re fighting about, but what's the lowest common denominator?\u201d Slowly it became clear that the trade provisions and some of the immigration and research restrictions in the Senate bill were just too controversial for the House Democrats, and we couldn\u2019t resolve them with the remaining time. Through discussions, we understood that everyone wants the semiconductors, the chips part was hugely bipartisan, and everyone really liked the science pieces. We had to make some changes to accommodate the House, but we thought that maybe we could just go by on the chips and science parts at the end of the day. If we had to go, maybe we could just go on that. And that conversation began behind closed doors and not in a formal process. Yes, we had to move things through. We thought, we have an election coming up in three months, the window is closing to legislate on something substantively important, and our members want to run on something. The Senate ultimately passed CHIPS and Science in mid-July, before the August recess. It then went over to the House, which Speaker Pelosi controlled, so we expected to have no problem there. I was kind of on my way out at that time, so I started the process of managing the implementation of those bills, but I didn't get to see the fruition of it. I did just see that all the tech hubs got announced. CHIPS and Science is a tricky one because you have limited resources, but the outcomes are very important for the country, and for individual states and members, so there's a lot of jockeying. Where are the fabs going to go? Where are the hubs going to go? I'll just wax poetic for a bit because I'm proud of this and I fight with Paul Kane at the Washington Post about this often. For a long time, or at least in the 15 years I was there, people have said that all of the power is with the four leaders and the White House and that all of the deals get cut behind closed doors and in back rooms, that the committees are powerless and don't do anything. Leadership does have to negotiate the terms, but much of the transformative legislation, like CHIPS and Science, the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CARES Act, COVID bills, gun bills, and much of the transformative stuff in the Inflation Reduction Act, is written by the committees. Sure, the leadership negotiated the big terms. But the committees write all that stuff. And they often wind up negotiating with Republican ranking members and members down dais [ nb: junior members of Congress ]. The CHIPS and Science Act was all legislation that got reported out of the committees, and the bipartisan infrastructure law was like seven Senate committee bills put into one. The leader\u2019s office helps provide vision and negotiates and problem solves, but I don't think it's fair to say that the House and Senate committees are not critical. They\u2019re incredibly important. The leaders don't write bills out of thin air. They don't have the capacity and that\u2019s not the way the system is set up. I have this long-standing point that I often make which is that the Senate is not an atrophied institution. It still works pretty well when you let it. Yes. Yes. I would update the rules to allow more efficiencies. People complain, \u201cWhy don't they do the 12 appropriations bills?\u201d They just tried to pass three of them, and it took seven weeks. There should be special procedures for certain types of bills. If you have overwhelmingly bipartisan support, you should be able to move faster. Thanks to Rita Sokolova for her judicious edits on this interview. How does the office of the Senate majority leader work differently from the office of a run-of-the-mill senator? What are the organizational differences? How does information enter the majority leader\u2019s office, and what does that information diet look like? How does it get synthesized? Go a level deeper for me on the distinction between floor staff and policy staff. What are the roles and day-to-days of the floor staff? When it comes to bills like CHIPS and Science, how much of the nitty gritty is driven by senators themselves, vs. by staff? When you have bipartisan support, as you did with CHIPS and Science, how often do senators have to be in the room to hash out the details? When a bill like CHIPS and Science passes, how much of that legislative success do you attribute to careful procedural and tactical work on the floor and committee wheeling and dealing? To clarify for our readers, the threat that you were making was that you would put your version of CHIPS and Science into legislation that had to pass. Why are official conferences so rare? Was that stance from the leader's office purely in the interest of moving things through in that term of Congress? What did the fights over CHIPS and Science implementation focus on? Was it about how the money would be disbursed? That's fine. Before we wrap up, are there other critical aspects of the legislative process that we haven\u2019t discussed? Are there procedural changes that you would make to the Senate as it exists today? Sen.

'Remove from saved articles' : 'Save article'\"> Some policy books have a singular idea, propounded faithfully over hundreds of pages. In The Conservative Futurist: How to Create the Sci-Fi World We Were Promised , James Pethokoukis tackles many ideas through the lens of one overarching theme: Economic growth is essential. There\u2019s much to like about the book. For one thing, the core contention is right. Pethokoukis, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, revisits the American sense of limitless technological possibilities after World War II, which stemmed from tremendous economic productivity. The United States produced approximately 60 percent of the world manufacturing output in 1950, he points out, and that era of growth created great optimism in American public life. But then came the Great Downshift, Pethokoukis\u2019 term for the productivity slowdown of the 1970s, which lingers to this day. He ably traces the origins of present-day problems back to that downshift, and he investigates leading culprits, from the scarcity of low-hanging-fruit innovations, to a flurry of regulatory barriers , to a broader societal malaise shaping our minds and hearts. Looking to the future, Pethokoukis believes the key political battles will be between the \u201cUp Wing\u201d and the \u201cDown Wing,\u201d terms he uses to describe policies, societal attitudes, time periods, and even pop culture. \u201cThe second half of the 1990s is certainly the most Up Wing period within the living memory of most Americans,\u201d he writes. Star Trek is also Up Wing, while most Hollywood movies today are Down Wing. In his words, \u201cDown Wing is about accepting limits, even yearning for them \u2026 Down Wingers are doomsters. Up Wing is about accelerating past limits \u2026 The burden of proof is on the defender of stasis.\u201d Many of the policies Pethokoukis describes as Up Wing are salutary, and they mirror policies that my think tank home, the Institute for Progress , advocates. (Full disclosure: I was once a junior colleague of Pethokoukis at the American Enterprise Institute). Smarter and more experimental spending on R&D, from both private and public sources, would likely reap productivity dividends. Ditto for making cities more affordable, reforming environmental review processes, and improving our high-speed rail network where feasible. A Pethokoukian, growth-oriented policy agenda would go a long way toward resolving key bottlenecks to thriving for a great many Americans. Where the book struggles, however, is in articulating a broader philosophical grounding for his stance that is, as the title of the book suggests, at once conservative and futurist. What is conservative futurism? \u201cI\u2019m an American-style conservative,\u201d Pethokoukis writes, adding that being one consists mainly of supporting classical liberalism, the tradition \u201cthat champions the freedom to choose one\u2019s pursuit of happiness \u2026 in particular economic freedom.\u201d Support for markets is the paramount purity test for Pethokoukis\u2019 conservatism. Pethokoukis has less to say about the importance of protecting traditional institutions, non-economic virtues, or conceptions of the human being. Though he emphasizes that he doesn\u2019t \u201cyearn for a world government to serve or an AI god to worship,\u201d he does laud dreams for humanity to see itself as \u201cone global society\u2014one free of the artificial division of race, class, gender, or nationality.\u201d He argues that \u201calmost every gadget and gizmo \u2026 that [makes] our lives something more than \u2018solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\u2019\u201d was invented in the past two centuries. He critiques William F. Buckley Jr. (\u201cstanding athwart history, yelling \u2018Stop!\u2019\u201d) and Russell Kirk (who called the car \u201ca mechanical Jacobin\u201d). And he quotes the American futurist Ray Kurzweil\u2014\u201cbrimming with Up Wing confidence\u201d\u2014who remarked that \u201cThe human species will be in a position to change the nature of mortality in a post-biological future.\u201d But one need not hate the car to think dreams of a post-biological future are not especially conservative. Moreover, Pethokoukis\u2019 Up Wing philosophy makes few appeals to \u201cDown Wingers.\u201d He\u2019s familiar with the concerns of critics like Lewis Mumford, who feared the \u201cMegamachine\u201d was devouring civic life, or Jacques Ellul and his concern that \u201call-embracing technological systems had swallowed up both capitalistic and socialistic economies \u2026 a far greater threat to our freedom of action than authoritarian politics.\u201d He thinks the critics are right, but also that the great technological \u201cswallowing up\u201d is a good thing. He writes that we should think of the American economy \u201cas a $21 trillion living supercomputer, a wondrous, wealth-generating techno-organism \u2026 with one primary purpose: to process information (to reorder matter).\u201d The goal of public policy is to produce \u201ceducated, trained, healthy humans who \u2026 connect with each other through networks of various sorts to produce complex, information-dense crystals of imagination.\u201d This is a way of thinking about the American project that likely won\u2019t convert those outside the choir. Rather than spend much time arguing with today\u2019s Luddites, Pethokoukis calls for the creation of inspiring Up Wing content that will win their hearts. American society was better when it produced and consumed cultural products that were optimistic about the future, and is worse now that it produces and consumes apocalyptic, dystopian imaginary futures. He calls for \u201cUp Wingers with resources to directly finance Up Wing cultural efforts,\u201d to fight back against a Hollywood which \u201crarely makes Up Wing content.\u201d Those cultural efforts could include more World\u2019s Fairs that showcase new technology, and a \u201cGenesis Clock,\u201d to counteract the pernicious influence of the Doomsday Clock. But it\u2019s unclear to me whether the cultural production of thrilling images of tomorrow precedes changes in attitudes about technology, follows them, or has little to do with them at all. Critics of technology have concerns that can\u2019t always be assuaged by Netflix. To his great credit, Pethokoukis goes out of his way to note historical shifts caused by technology, like the \u201c Engels\u2019 pause \u201d in the English Industrial Revolution, which produced remarkable societal loss along with economic loss. As Pethokoukis\u2019 AEI colleague Michael Strain pointed out , \u201creal wages fell dramatically for some occupations \u2026 lives were shattered. Some families suffered across generations.\u201d And Pethokoukis acknowledges that average wages for regular workers are up only about 5 percent since the Nixon administration, accounting for inflation. But the book is light on responses to those workers, or to critics of a particular technology, that might convince them to change their views. Pethokoukis isn\u2019t alone in his trouble allying a techno-optimistic spirit and a belief in the power of markets to more subterranean currents in the American right wing. I have trouble with this too, and it\u2019s not clear that a coalition exists or can be created along these lines. At the moment, one can find both prominent Silicon Valley figures and cultural conservatives united against identitarians and occasionally for American hard tech dominance. Ask them about genetically modifying one\u2019s children, uploading one\u2019s consciousness to the cloud, \u201c reality privilege ,\u201d vaccines, GMOs, or even the cultural effects of UberEats and DoorDash, and the cleavages in the coalition begin to appear. There are politicians, entrepreneurs, and thinkers trying to bridge the divide, arguing that some form of techno-optimism can exist alongside (and even bolster) the parts of human life conservatives value, but it is often a difficult argument to make. For one, building a durable Up Wing politics requires convincing individuals about specific technologies: that the desire that led to it was a good one, that people stand to benefit from its creation, that it won\u2019t replace people, lead to their obsolescence or that of their culture, and so on. That\u2019s an easier argument to make for some technologies than others. Zoom, for example, has enabled a return to the home as a site of production, and supercharged emigration from blue cities to red state suburbs. By contrast, good luck trying to frame artificial wombs as a conservative project. And more fundamentally, insofar as a techno-optimist right exists, it\u2019s far more comfortable with state action than Pethokoukis. While he\u2019s skeptical of \u201cindustrial policy,\u201d many of the Up Wing periods he cites were the products of industrial policy administered by politicians he also lauds, like Alexander Hamilton . The 1950s American manufacturing dominance he loves was historically contingent: The war had supercharged American industry, and its competitors were left in shambles. Many of his favorite innovations were produced via serious governmental involvement, whether Operation Warp Speed\u2019s pull mechanisms, the DARPA R&D funding that produced the internet, or the milestone payments that supported SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket. Free markets may be a necessary but insufficient condition for technological growth. Belief in the power of markets, therefore, may be a necessary piece of a forward-looking conservative movement. But it surely can\u2019t be the only piece. If futurists want to build that movement, they\u2019ll have to justify their vision of human flourishing to a skeptical audience. Pethokoukis\u2019 book has many strengths, but it leaves that task for the future. Santi Ruiz is the Senior Editor for Institute for Progress and author of the Statecraft Substack.

    "keywords": "Can policy makers take lessons from the success of Operation Warp Speed (OWS)? As my colleague Arielle D\u2019Souza has noted , \u201cthe OWS model isn\u2019t a universal solution to pressing problems.\u201d But can we leverage specific features of it to prevent future pandemics, or cure Alzheimer\u2019s, or other national priorities? On November 6th, the Institute for Progress , 1Day Sooner, and the Medical Countermeasures Coalition co-hosted a conference on Operation Warp Speed and its potential descendants. At the conference, former Secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) Alex Azar answered these questions and more. Why you can\u2019t do a Warp Speed for Alzheimer\u2019s Would money be appropriated for OWS today? Why HHS is a \u201cJV\u201d Cabinet member Azar played a crucial role in Operation Warp Speed by overseeing the coordination and logistics of the program. He worked closely with pharmaceutical companies, government agencies, and public health officials to accelerate the development, production, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. He was interviewed here by Taylor Sexton , who previously served under Azar at HHS as Senior Advisor to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. Azar speaks during a news conference on Operation Warp Speed. For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: I think it's a genuine challenge. A lot of people say, \u201cCreate a Warp Speed for this, that, and the other.\u201d We'll probably talk about some of those possible examples today, but the funding is a critical starting point. When Dr. Bob Kadlec , Peter Marks , Paul Mango and I sat down initially, I was able to say, \u201cTake money off the table.\u201d Since we\u2019d spent $2 trillion on COVID relief, literally any amount of money that we would spend would have an infinite return on investment. There were effectively unlimited supplies of money when I commissioned the team originally. That's unusual. I remember back in the Bush Administration when we were afraid of a pandemic flu virus, and Secretary Leavitt and I created the first pandemic planning exercise in 2000, I guess it was probably 2005 when we got it kicked off. I remember going over and negotiating with Joel Kaplan and Josh Bolten to get a budget request for $7.1 billion [ Bolten featured prominently in the first Statecraft interview, on PEPFAR ] . That was like real money back then. And we couldn't get that through. We couldn't get that through Congress, and I was literally working with the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader. I could not get $7.1 billion through Congress in the absence of a crisis. I have to be quite pessimistic about the ability to, on the financial side, execute something like OWS in the absence of a catastrophic, systemic-type crisis. It's just not how we work. But I think it's one of the defining features of what we need. We need some form of appropriated money that is accessible and available. Because I've got to tell you, if we had to go to Congress and get a new appropriation for Operation Warp Speed, it wouldn't have happened for a couple reasons. One, my good friends at OMB would have said no, because they would have known it would become must-pass legislation that would become a Christmas tree , and therefore, a $26 billion request would have become a half-trillion dollar package of gobbledygook. And so they wouldn't have let the process start. Stu Simonson , who really came up with the idea for and created Project BioShield , had the idea of a permanent indefinite appropriation for medical countermeasures. Robert Byrd , the big appropriator, didn't like that being taken out of his hands, and so that got killed, and that's why with BioShield we live with the hundreds of millions of dollars that we can get every year. I think it was about $500 million a year during our time, which was so short of our targets. So I'm somewhat pessimistic, honestly. I hate to be, but I want to be realistic. The key to Operation Warp Speed, what made it unique was it was about execution. It wasn't about discovery. It wasn't like, \u201cLet's do an Operation Warp Speed to find a cure for cancer.\u201d No. We had over a hundred vaccine targets. We knew we had a vaccineable virus, because the human body could heal itself, meaning that our body could produce antibodies sufficient to recover. If we could trick the body into believing it had COVID, you could create a vaccine. We also, on therapeutics, just from the history of dealing with monoclonal antibodies, had reason to believe that we could create artificial human response through monoclonal antibodies. It became about brute force. Could you simply make things happen faster, execute faster than ever before? Then you get into issues like \u201cHow do you make it work in a public-private partnership? How do you solve the incentive issues? How do you de-risk development for the pharma companies? How do you de-risk and accelerate manufacturing by pre-funding all of your commercial-scale manufacturing and committing to commercial acquisition, regardless of the state of the disease and the need for a product at the end of the day. How do you de-risk distribution by using existing distribution systems and funding all of that?\u201d And, \u201cHow do you solve the human capital issue of getting the right people?\u201d As with anything, people is policy. And getting the right people involved, the right leadership, the right structures of governance to enable, to empower, to isolate them, to give them the freedom of movement so that Gus Perna , Moncef Slaoui , etc. could have the power and freedom to do what they needed to do without political or bureaucratic interference. That's what Warp Speed was about. That's the core of it. When we talk about replicating it, it's keeping that aspect in mind. There are other ways to fund things, other ways to create incentive structures. We can talk about those, but Warp Speed was primarily an execution focus. The partnership with DOD was unprecedented, and without it, Warp Speed wouldn't have happened. And frankly, I think if you hadn't had a cabinet secretary like Mark Esper as the Secretary of Defense, it wouldn't have happened. I've dealt with Secretaries of Defense over the course of my pretty long public life. Remember, HHS is the JV cabinet, okay? We're on the cusp, but we're still the JV. I gotta tell you, the notion that a Secretary of Defense takes a call from the Secretary of HHS on a weekend, a cell phone call, that's big, number one. But Mark and I were very good friends and colleagues. Number two, that he says immediately, \u201cWhatever you need, you have the entire Department of Defense at your disposal.\u201d I love Don Rumsfeld, but those words would not have come out of his mouth. This was about individual leadership. What that means for the future is, we can't build enduring systems assuming certain personalities and selfless leaders like Mark Esper will be in their roles at the time. This is something Dr. Kadlec and I wrestled with, I don't know if we actually agreed on this point, DOD brought incredible capabilities to the table: the Defense Logistics Agency , procurement, logistics, operations, go through that lengthy list. There's been a long-standing debate since Warp Speed: \u201cDo you just build that at HHS so it's there at the ready?\u201d Because HHS doesn't do those things well. It's not our wheelhouse. We have really smart scientific minds, but logistics, operations, and procurement are not the core. As with pharma manufacturing, it's very hard to build something and have it run without a warm base. It gets stale, the personnel don't work, idle hands are the devil's plaything, blah, blah, blah. I've always been of the mindset that you need to have a day job, and that DOD has the day job of running our military. What you should have are systems where you can, regardless of the secretaries involved, basically pull in the DLA-type capabilities to scale when needed, as opposed to building up that infrastructure in-house at HHS and thinking that somehow it won't atrophy on the vine when it doesn't have the day job of deploying the US military around the world to keep it busy, occupied, and at a high skill level. It's a fair point of disagreement. The current administration, I think, has tried to insource that work within HHS. It's different from the decision I made. Not sure where Bob is on that issue. Were you with me or against me? I don't know. [Kadlec interjects, \u201cI was with you, sir,\u201d and the audience laughs.] But I think that's a challenge. And I would just say for any future administration, and I don't know if this has happened, having that playbook ready for interagency collaboration and how do you merge DOD and HHS or another department as need be, that ought to happen. That playbook needs to be there because it was very interpersonal, relationship-based. I always felt that we had complete bipartisan support. We, I was always quite careful to keep in close contact with, what's the formal name for the big four? With my four corners . Three years later, I even forget the terminology. My four corners, those are the top Democrat and Republican House and Senate appropriators. Anytime they wanted information, we were keeping them in the loop. We kept their clerks in the loop. We made sure that there was transparency. and they were fully on board, cooperative. We never had an issue. It was totally bipartisan. That's with people like Rosa DeLauro and Patty Murray on the other side, with me on this side. Crisis brings that to the table. I don't know that you see that replicated for the same reasons as we talked about initially. I don't know that you see that kind of bipartisan working relationship happening outside of a crisis, in a preparedness, advanced countermeasures activity. I think you get into a lot of other issues that come up: where's money coming from? That's often the issue; it doesn't have to do with the money you're trying to spend on that particular program. It's what the pay-for is, or what the Christmas tree is that's being added to it, is where the fights often come about. Few would dispute spending money on countermeasures development. We're spending a lot of money on countermeasures, development, and capabilities. It's what comes with it. Please forgive me if I misunderstand elements of it, but I don't think of Project NextGen as the latest iteration of or continuation of Operation Warp Speed. Again, Operation Warp Speed was about a very defined goal, we said it publicly, which is enough vaccines for all Americans. An approved, authorized vaccine by the end of the year. It was a very clear goal structure, and we had a credible, scientific, technical reason to believe that it could be done. As Moncef said when we interviewed him for the job, literally everything that happened, had to happen right without a day's delay. It had to be a miracle. We got a miracle. NextGen feels more like BARDA BioShield to me, in fact, because it's more of a grant than a cooperative agreement or procurement? The challenge you've got there is, what's the government's right to operate in that space? Because we have a private sector that invests tens of billions of dollars in this space, both therapeutics and vaccines. Why the government? Are you solving a market failure or a market inefficiency? For instance, botulinum antitoxin . I can make you a really good case why the US government needs to fund the development of botulinum antitoxin and needs to buy and secure supplies of and be a very predictable purchaser of botulinum antitoxin, because there are not many CVS's out there that want to stock that. Okay? That's pretty easy. But countermeasures, therapeutics for COVID variants, nasal spray, vaccines, next-gen vaccines, next-gen diagnostics: You have to analyze that. You have to say, \u201cIs there a commercial marketplace?\u201d I think we've seen with some of the recent announcements out of Pfizer, for instance, that some of the antiviral markets maybe aren't as enduring and durable as we thought, but what's the commercial case that the US government needs to be involved as a guaranteed purchaser or as a funder of R&D to make that happen? Would it happen in the absence of government action? That for me is the first question. Because if it's going to happen without the US government doing it, then you should let it happen, because we will only get in the way of it. But if it is needed, then we have to think about what the intervention is. And the challenge with the way the BARDA system works is it's often grants. That was actually what got Dr. Bob Kadlec and me down on the path of Operation Warp Speed, was a BARDA grant of half a billion dollars to a pharmaceutical company. Grants don't come with terms and conditions on the price of a product, the commercial delivery of a product, quantities of a product, timelines on delivery. Grants are like NIH. It's, \u201cHere's money. You had a neat project and a neat proposal. Here's money now. God bless, we hope good things come from that.\u201d it doesn't have the type of accountability of a procurement or a cooperative agreement. So I would hope as BARDA thinks about these things, that they think about, \u201cHow is it a real public-private partnership? Why are you there? What's the government's right to operate in this space? Why are you using taxpayer money? Why are you involved?\u201d And then, how do you set up accountability so it's not just like NIH R01 funding , just sprinkling money about and hoping some flowers bloom. Because that often is the approach . I hope the people involved have a really good understanding of pharmaceutical development timelines and finances and incentive structures around it, because you'll just need to make sure there are no valleys of death in there. That's another thing where BARDA can play a big role: Is it at the venture stage, are you preclinical, is it at clinical, is it late stage clinical, is it at manufacturing? Where do they need a little help from BARDA and the government to be involved? Among policy makers, the thing I wish they would get right would be this notion that it's about execution. You hear: \u201cWe need an Operation Warp Speed for Alzheimer's.\u201d When you tell me you have fully characterized the mechanism, what causes Alzheimer's, and what the mechanism of action is that will deal with Alzheimer's, and then it's just about brute force of going through large-scale clinical trials and manufacturing scale-up and commercial market building to make that happen, I'd say yes. But when we're still debating, is it the amyloid hypothesis , tau tangles , or whatever else, you're still in the discovery phase. That's not the brute force execution of a Warp Speed. It's a very creditable, very important scientific and human health venture. It's just not Warp Speed. That\u2019s me being technical about how one thinks about it. The thing that I worry about, from a public perspective, is they think it's replicable. With Warp Speed, truly the stars aligned. You had unbelievable people willing to give their lives like Moncef Slaoui and Carlos De Notaristefani and hundreds of others coming in from the private sector. Government officials like Gus Perna, Bob Kadlec, Paul Mango, Matt Hepburn , Janet Woodcock . You just had the right people that, thanks be to God, were at the right place at the right time. The right Secretary of Defense. And it all worked. It all aligned. But it's not cookie cutter. People now think, \u201cOh, we'll just get a vaccine in seven months for a new disease. It'll happen.\u201d No, sorry. We were very fortunate that this all worked. and it's still making vaccines and making therapeutics especially for a novel pathogen. It\u2019s rocket science. It is. I worry that people underestimate that. They think that whatever else happens, \u201cOh, we'll just turn the spigot on again and that's what will come out.\u201d I think they underestimate, frankly, the courage of those involved. This was really politically stupid. I looked back at the quotes, including from many of my own team, when we announced this in May 2020. One of these alleged \u201cpublic health experts\u201d was on TV saying, \u201cThis is another instance of POTUS in La La Land,\u201d or \u201cPOTUS in Wonderland.\u201d \u201cThis is all political, this is all dreamt up.\u201d I teach at the University of Miami, and I was talking about Warp Speed and I had a woman at the end of class say, \u201cMr. Secretary, did you think about what would happen if all six vaccines failed?\u201d And I stared into the outer distance, and I said, \u201cI actually didn't.\u201d Maybe as a leader, you have to have that supreme level of confidence that this will happen. And plus, we did our Monte Carlo probabilizations . We knew our likelihood of technical success across the molecules, but anything could have gone wrong, from supply chain to manufacturing disruption to protein replication. One thing that\u2019s overlooked by the general public is that a lot of the luck we had was built on the foundational science over decades of discovery, both in the platforms and the antigens. How do the government and private sector continue to invest in that foundational science as well? Yeah, absolutely. It was decades of funding into the mRNA platform, which was totally unproven. It is a challenge to keep support up for NIH and the funding that we do for primary research. I do get nervous. That's part of the reason I get a bit nervous when we talk a lot about translational medicine, et cetera. I get very nervous, as you can probably guess, when I hear the government talking about trying to replicate what the private sector in biopharma does. Because they do it really well, and they aggregate huge amounts of capital and are really good at placing a diverse group of bets there. What they don't do is the commons, the basic primary research. That's the foundation that becomes generally applicable knowledge. It could be on physiology, target identification, even molecule target and receptor identification, target validation: all of that can open the pathways to the multibillion dollar investments. So I always get worried. What's NIH, about 60 billion now? Maybe more. I get worried when there's any diversion of that towards playing drug company. We need so much of that focus on the primary research that is the foundation for all of that. Let's face it, the varsity cabinet is still Defense, State, Treasury, Justice, and, sort of, Homeland Security, the big five. But you\u2019re right: HHS is the world's largest insurance company, the world's largest funder of primary research, the world's largest funder of epidemiology, and the largest funder of the welfare state. That's the day job. Contingency management is important too; really, since the \u201890s, HHS has thought of itself as a national security agency. But thinking of yourself that way doesn't mean the rest of the world does. If America gets attacked, I may be sitting in coach on Southwest in the back of a plane. That's not what happens to the Secretary of Defense. The point you made about collaboration, how do we make public-private collaboration more enduring and more repeatable, is a really good point. Maybe DOD over-indexes on collaboration in the defense establishment. But we probably could do a lot better. The problem is at HHS, there are significant antibodies. You are the regulator of industry at FDA. You are the payer of industry at CMS. So there is a natural disinclination to be seen as too cozy. But for what you're talking about, that notion of exercising and validating the process of working together for creating diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines on a very short timeline: it has to be a two-way street. If you think you can come up with these ideas in the Humphrey Building on your own, you're fooling yourself. You're not running these businesses. You do not know how they work. You don't know their manufacturing processes. You don't understand the incentive structures internally. They don't know how to run HHS, but you don't know how to run their biopharmace"

    "keywords": "In his first years in office, President Biden undid many of the Trump Administration\u2019s restrictions on immigration. But with aid to Israel and Ukraine now tied to immigration in Congress, President Biden seems poised to move his immigration policy to the right. As Chief of Policy and Strategy at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Amanda Baran was central to President Biden\u2019s early efforts to reverse his predecessor's policies. Baran has been on the frontlines in some of the most contentious policy aspects of the immigration crisis, and understands the power of rules and regulations to affect immigrant communities. Previously, Baran served as the Principal Director of Immigration Policy at the Department of Homeland Security, where she co-founded the Department's Council on Combating Violence Against Women (now the Council on Combating Gender-Based Violence ). In this interview, I spoke with Baran about how to resolve policy disputes between agencies and assert your priorities during a change in administrations. How agencies coordinate on regulatory policy How to lead large overhauls of immigration rules How user interviews and feedback loops shape rulemaking For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: I was the Chief of Policy and Strategy at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, and is the agency that processes immigration applications: green cards, H-1B visas, temporary protected status, etc. It\u2019s the agency before which people apply for citizenship and asylum. DHS shares the responsibility for running the immigration system with the State Department and the Department of Justice. Here\u2019s how agency policy broadly works: Congress passes laws, and then agencies interpret those laws through regulations and sub-regulatory policy. You have to answer questions like: \u201cHow many copies of this document do you need to include when you file for your green card? What types of questions should we have on forms? How should the agency interpret words laid out in statute?\u201d This type of work doesn\u2019t make the news, but it\u2019s important that we have these policies so that people can apply for benefits. My job was to create more fair access for people coming through our system. President Biden issued an Executive Order titled, \u201cRestoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans,\u201d that prompted us to ask questions: \u201cWhat are the barriers and how do we remove them? Why are immigration forms so long? How do we make the rules clearer and easier for people to follow?\u201d Regulations are a powerful tool that most people don't know much about. Regulations define statutes, and they have the force of law. It can take years to write regulations. People complain that the process is bureaucratic, but the bureaucracy exists for a reason. The government wants to make sure that the public has an official way to weigh in on major policy changes. Anyone can comment on a regulation. You don\u2019t have to be associated with any particular organization or have specific expertise. The Trump Administration used regulations and sub-regulatory policy to curtail access to immigration benefits. My goal at USCIS was to rescind harmful policies and implement fairer ones. I led a large team of incredible public servants who did, and still do, that work every day. My specific area of expertise and passion lies at the intersection of women's rights and immigration. The law has created immigration benefits that give special status to people who are survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and trafficking and to children who are abused or neglected. I\u2019ve poured a lot of energy into those issues and my team was successful in implementing a number of policy changes to help those populations. The Trump Administration was successful in harnessing the regulatory system to make a number of significant policy changes, but many of them were tied up in legal challenges. When I arrived, many of these regulations were in different stages of litigation. We had to wade through the litigation and understand our options if we wanted to get these regulations off the books. We took steps to make that happen. We also wanted to put forward our own regulatory agenda and propose an affirmative policy platform. We had direction from the President through his Executive Orders. We engaged with advocates to understand their most urgent policy needs. We took suggestions from civil servants who are experts in their fields. We examined our resources and thought of ways to make internal processes more streamlined. We discussed these with leadership and formulated an agenda that you can find online at reginfo.gov . This agenda is updated every spring and fall and spans across government. Regulatory development requires the talents and skills of many different people at many different parts of an agency, throughout the interagency, and in the White House. At DHS, to propose a regulation for public review, it must first be cleared by all the component directorates within USCIS and component agencies within DHS. Then it must be approved by the Secretary to go to the interagency for their comments and clearance. After that process, which could take 90 days or more, it goes back to DHS to resolve comments. After comments are resolved, it is published in the Federal Register for a 60-day period to give the public an opportunity to comment. When the comment period concludes, DHS is required by law to consider these comments and explain why or why they are not taking the comments. This explanation is included in the final rule that is eventually published. It is a lengthy but considered process. Each agency has its own culture and internal process, but generally, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), which sits within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), is the hub for regulatory development throughout the government. OIRA will bring the parties within government together to resolve their issues if a dispute arises during the interagency review period. Most concerns can be resolved at the staff level, but sometimes there are disputes that have to be elevated to agency leadership or involve the White House. This is when things can get tricky within agencies, because a lot of work can be siloed. Sometimes operators don\u2019t fully understand the policy or may envision implementation differently. It\u2019s a constant challenge to ensure that the intent of the policy is being honored and implemented correctly. Good training is key, as is public engagement. The public is a valued partner because they feel the effects immediately if things are going sideways. It\u2019s vital that agencies engage early and often with impacted communities. I\u2019m so glad you asked this question, because I care deeply about proper implementation. What is the point of a policy if its intended effects are not being felt? I immigrated to the U.S. as a kid and went through the immigration process, so I understand how intimidating it can feel. Like I mentioned previously, public engagement is very important. At USCIS we would host open conference calls with the public to get their feedback about what is working and what is not working. On some of those calls, we would have hundreds of people. Similarly, we would ask adjudications officers for their feedback, because we wanted to understand their perspectives. We would hear the most interesting things and solicit a lot of information. And now, under this administration, customer experience has become a priority \u2014 so much so that the President issued an Executive Order requiring agencies to review their policies and procedures to ensure that they are accessible by the public. Amanda Baran What would you say to the person who is currently occupying your role? There is only one year left in this term. I would encourage my successor to identify some key goals and do what it takes to make them happen. There are many priorities on the table, things left undone, that folks will want to push through. Make sure you are part of this push. This requires knowing the substance and having good relationships with the right people. And make sure your policy is legally sound. Many regulations and policies issued by the previous administration were stopped in courts because they were not meticulous. And last, I would tell my successor, I believe in you. It can be hard to work in leadership positions in established institutions when you\u2019re a woman, and especially when you\u2019re a woman of color. People don\u2019t always want to respect your authority.

It originally provided real-time updates to America\u2019s children via a hotline, and it now also maintains an online Santa Tracker . But it\u2019s not easy to stay on top of Santa\u2019s \u201cachronal\u201d movements. What You\u2019ll Learn: Why Santa slows down over North America The iron law Santa always follows Why Air Force pilots escort St. Nick in American airspace Our interviewee today, Dr. Chris Ellis , was a combat career officer for 24 years. He now serves as Chief of Future Operations at NORAD, and is an expert on individual household disaster preparedness in the United States and other developed countries. For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: How has the technology to track Santa changed over time? What's the state of the art? Back in 1948, we really just had the ground-based radar systems. We hadn't put a man on the moon yet. We weren't even officially tracking Santa until 10 years later in 1958, in the height of the Cold War. But what we refer to now as the North Warning System is a system of about 50 radars across the globe. The majority of them are in North America (Alaska and Canada) primarily to detect threats. But we have them all across the globe. So that's part A, and when we do track Santa, because he takes off from the North Pole, it's perfect, he's right within our detection zone and he pops up almost immediately in a ballistic trajectory. So thanks, Santa. I appreciate that. By ballistic trajectory, think missile. Anything that kind of lofts, it doesn't have to be a nice arc, but also cruise missiles or things along those lines as well. Airplanes have a not-quite ballistic trajectory. Santa's sleigh and his reindeer work the same way. So when Santa goes to places that are far away from the North Pole, the great thing is we can pick him up in two ways by our satellites: one, just by his movements. But he also helps us out, because Rudolph's red nose does show up on the infrared spectrum. So we can track Rudolph. When he goes around to other places, like Kenya or New Zealand, we're tracking him via those two means, and then we still maintain our satellite queuing of him when he comes across North American airspace, specifically Canada and the United States. When he enters our air defense zone, basically he gets a personalized escort. So up in Canada, they have FA-18 Hornets that escort Santa and he'll actually slow down, because he's got to travel nearly the speed of light to hit all the kids around the world. But he'll slow down for us. One of the things we've learned after tracking him for 68 years is that he experiences time differently, which is fascinating. That's how he's able to hit all the kids around the world. But the third way we track him is not really tracking him, but we escort him with those fighters: Canadian in Canadian airspace, and then with our Raptors or Eagles , our U.S. aircraft, when he's over the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii. [In a friend\u2019s newsletter , Chris explained that \u201cIt is believed that A-10 Thunderbolts move too slow, even for reindeer at delivery speed. Sorry Warthog Bros.\u201d] And then he also does visit the territories as well, so he hits Puerto Rico, he hits Guam etc., and we're around him when he's doing those things as well. The interesting thing about Santa is that he almost always takes off at the same time, usually around 6 a.m. Eastern time every December 24th. But his route does vary. He's never had the same route twice. Our assumption on that is that his naughty or nice list is different every single year, and so he follows a different pattern to hit all the good boys and girls. He does. In fact, that's one of those asynchronous things, where he experiences time differently. Again, we don't know how he does it, but one of the other rules we\u2019ve found is that Santa does not visit a house unless the children are asleep. The biggest reason is that NORAD and NORTHCOM have a global presence. We have the geosynchronous satellites to follow him everywhere he goes, just because NORAD tracks all threats to North America, 365/24/7. While we don't classify Santa as a threat, again, he maintains that ballistic or aerial profile. And we\u2019re a global force, that's why we can do it. We know there are others that track him in certain areas, like the Canadian Broadcasting Company. But they don't have the global presence like we do. We're guessing that other localities and countries have their localized tracking for him, South Korea for example. But again, we're a global presence. I think it's a mix. For one, it's a show of solidarity. We are not intercepting him, we are escorting him. It's a friendly gesture, almost like welcoming a foreign dignitary. And the other reason is more of my personal view, is that... these are Air Force pilots, and sometimes they're right on the borderline between naughty and nice. If you're a pilot trying to get on Santa's nice list at the last minute, escorting him may be a good way to get that final stocking stuffer. He's exceptionally friendly. It's pretty standard in the Air Force, when you want to show a friendly maneuver saying hello, to rock your wings. And what Santa will do in return is rock his sleigh or smile. And we do think that Santa's giving his reindeers a little bit of a break when he's flying over North America and Canada. He slows down again a bit for us. It's a pretty taxing night for St. Nick. I think it's just a show of mutual gratitude. Like Colonel Harry Shoup , who took that kid's phone call back in 1958 and started NORAD\u2019s Santa tracking, a few times a month, I will sit in on what's called the \u201cJOC floor.\u201d The JOC ( Joint Operations Center ) floor\u2019s motto is \u201cWe have the watch,\u201d and we will watch live for any and all threats against North America. A few times a month, I'll sit in that job as the chief of operations and monitor all indicators, warnings, and threats against North America. Yep. Watch Matthew Broderick in WarGames or any movie that shows a military thing with all the big screens on the TV. Just think of that with a whole bunch of computers and a whole bunch of TV screens. Maybe we do watch football every once in a while if it's a slow night. Sometimes. It depends on what's going on. I'll just give you some facts and figures on our tracking, because I find this pretty amazing. The website itself is now in nine different languages. We get calls and website visits from the United States, from Canada, Japan, South Korea, Ireland, Australia, Chile, Spain. I'm talking in the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, and in the millions for website visits. We get over a quarter of a million phone calls every single year in just one day. And we live-answer roughly 80,000 calls talking to kids from across the world. Obviously the overwhelming majority of our volunteers speak English. For those who don't actually get through to us, you'll get a pre recorded message of where Santa's at. But we do tell the children where Santa's at, based upon our three systems. But we\u2019re not able to tell them if they're on the naughty or nice list. I'll tell you that we now get about 10 million hits a year just from Amazon\u2019s Alexa alone. You can ask \u201cHey Alexa, can you ask NORAD where Santa's at?\u201d Alexa will connect to our systems and say, \u201cSanta's located over Portugal right now\u201d or wherever he is. So it's pretty extensive. And the roughly thousand volunteers that we have, from what I've heard, they really enjoy it. The furthest call that I've known was someone from Morocco. No, that's Santa's OPSEC right there, his operational security. He keeps that close to the chest. Let's say Santa is over, I don't know, Italy. So we're tracking him by satellite. And we see where he stops by, maybe he goes to Rome and maybe he's moving northward to Venice and Vicenza and on his route to Austria. That gets relayed up to our satellites. Our satellites then come through our system. We get a ping, for lack of a better term, of where Santa's at, because, again, he's got a sleigh-and-eight-reindeer profile. So we're able to track, in near real time, exactly where he's at. I would call it, and this is my non-technical term, it's almost like a rubber band effect sometimes, where you're watching a movie and things speed up and go back, like when your video is buffering. That's how Santa operates. Again, it's that \u201cachronal time\u201d that he's able to do outside of time. Even though children haven't gone to bed, sometimes he's able to achronally go back to a location that he's already passed. We haven't figured that out. We talked to NORAD\u2019s chief Santa tracking officer about how it works. I've got a quote here from a US Air Force memo , dated Christmas Eve 1948. \u201dAn early warning radar net to the north detected one unidentified sleigh powered by eight reindeer at 14000 feet heading 180 degrees.\u201d How has the technology to track Santa changed over time? What's the state of the art? For our lay readers, what\u2019s a ballistic trajectory? When does Santa pop up on your tracking? I would assume that if some kids are awake at a given time, or the kids in Kenya are staying up late on a given Christmas, that he might shift around and come back later. Why is NORAD tracking him everywhere? There's not somebody else we can hand him off to when he's over Africa or Asia? And that fighter escort you mentioned, is that for him? Or for our peace of mind? What else do we know about Santa as a result of this once-a-year relationship? And what\u2019s your involvement in tracking St. Nick? I'm picturing a NASA control room kind of situation? And are you pacing up and down behind guys at desks? Okay. No cigars. You're not bright purple in the face. When you say you can't tell callers if they're on the naughty or nice list, is that a lack of intelligence or lack of authorization? Walk me through the night of Christmas Eve itself, when you\u2019re in that operations room. I'm curious how he covers for the kids who stayed up late. Do you see last-minute switchbacks? What\u2019s his method? Santa, tracked by patriots Since 1958, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) has tracked Santa Claus\u2019s whereabouts on Christmas Eve.

Offering them a prize to invent something that doesn\u2019t yet exist is a little more complicated. But this kind of incentive, a \u201cchallenge prize,\u201d has produced many of the technological achievements we take for granted today. Over the last decade, presidents have tried to encourage more agencies to issue prizes, rather than simply relying on their traditional procurement techniques of grants and contracts. But how do you make one of the biggest bureaucracies on earth adopt a new practice? Today we talk to perhaps the world\u2019s most authoritative source on getting government agencies to use prizes. Why prize challenges have been so historically effective When a prize can be too large How the OMB operates as \u201cthe president\u2019s disciplinarian\u201d What the CFO of a federal agency does Our guest today, Cristin Dorgelo , served at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) from 2012-2014, as chief of staff and as the assistant director for Grand Challenges, driving national initiatives in science and technology. She was recently the senior advisor for management at the Office of Management and the Budget (OMB), from January 2021 through January 2023. Previously, she managed major prize challenges at the XPRIZE Foundation, including the $30 million Google Lunar X Prize , the $10 million Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize , the $10 million Archon Genomics X PRIZE , the $2.5 million Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge and the $2.4 million Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup X Challenge . Dorgelo was also President and CEO of the Association of Science and Technology Centers. For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: What are prizes good for, and what are they bad at? It's helpful to have historical context for what prizes are good for and where to put them to use. Prizes are not new. In 1795, Napoleon offered 12,000 francs to improve upon food preservation methods at that time. This is how we got the canning methods we all use today. Dava Sobel\u2019s book Longitude is about the series of prizes from Spain, the Netherlands, and Britain that eventually led to the awarding of a prize in 1773 for John Harrison's method of longitude. Even flight: think of Raymond Orteig in 1919, offering a $25,000 prize to push the envelope on aviation and reward a nonstop flight between New York and Paris [which was won by Charles Lindbergh for his 1927 flight in the Spirit of St. Louis]. That prize inspired the eventual Ansari XPRIZE for commercial spaceflight, which was won by Burt Rutan for Spaceship One, and that led to Virgin Galactic and a rising commercial space industry. In the early 2000s, we saw this resurgence of incentive prizes. Mainly this was happening with the financial backing of philanthropy and high-net worth individuals. McKinsey issued a report [in 2009] finding a tripling to $375 million in incentive prize purses over the \u201800s. Governments started taking a look at this, and DARPA ran a series of challenges for autonomous vehicles in the early 2000s. NASA offered a series of centennial challenges starting in 2005 for a bunch of NASA's space exploration and space technology challenges, and Congress charged DOE in the early 2000s to run a prize for advanced performance in LED lighting . And that was awarded in 2011. Why was all this happening? Because prizes are a good way of shining a spotlight on a problem. You can draw attention by offering shiny prize purses and saying, \u201cThis is a goal we should work toward.\u201d You're only paying for results. A lot of government procurement in particular is done on the basis of a proposal, and somebody's ability to write on paper. By contrast, some of the most effective prizes have actually put technology into a demonstration environment that can show what it can do. We've seen prizes enable the offerers to reach beyond usual responders. You can identify some new talent. You might get some out-of discipline-perspectives, and sometimes that's the primary reason someone is offering the prize. Especially in technology demonstration prizes, you see private sector investment on top of that prize purse, sometimes even 10x or more. One of the geeky things that I'm most excited about in terms of prizes is the establishment of a level playing field \u2013 sandboxes where people from all corners can come and try something out. In particular, if you're going to award a prize, you have to know how to judge it. You have to figure out metrics and protocols for assessing performance. In clean energy in particular, that's been really helpful for establishing: \u201cWhat are we looking for?\u201d \u201cWhat are the standards that these technologies need to meet?\u201d And, \u201cwhat are the tradeoffs with things like cost, equity and performance?\u201d Sometimes offering a prize helps get a conversation going about how we measure progress in a given technological field. Prizes are not just one thing. Since that McKinsey report, a whole bunch of frameworks have been developed that have defined different types of prizes. I would note that there have been prizes for technology demonstration and hardware. Those are most of the examples I've given you so far, in part, because I think they're actually the most effective prizes. There also have been a few scientific challenges that look at pushing earlier in the scientific development process, a whole bunch of quite interesting data and algorithm competitions that are focused on ML and the use of large data sets to build on each other's progress iteratively to improve machine learning and algorithms. There\u2019s some sort-of effective app development challenges, which may or may not drive new effective apps and software. There\u2019s entrepreneurship and business plan challenges, where sponsors offer prizes in order to train and equip future entrepreneurs. Probably less immediately impactful, but an interesting way of uncovering new ideas, would be ideation challenges or design challenges, where the winners are really winning in a smaller award, usually for a proposal on paper. But it is a good way of getting a sense of a variety of options out there. First, some nascent technology development has already occurred. So if you look across the market, you can say, \u201cWhy yes, there are quite a number of promising potential performers out there that have not yet been able to bring their potential solutions forward.\u201d So some level of technology maturity. Second, you're actually asking for a demonstration in the real world. I've run competitions at the Department of Interior test tank at a Navy base in New Jersey, at a NASCAR track in Michigan, and in the deserts of California. You are seeing those prototypes get tested against a common set of metrics. The Oil and Hazardous Materials Simulated Environmental Test Tank, or \u201cOhmsett\u201d A floating wave energy conversion buoy being tested at Ohmsett So you know at the back end whether the technology is doing what it is claiming to do. That's different from an ideation competition, where it's much like a competition for proposals. You're just seeing this thing on paper. And I think the other part of that is it really can drive that private sector investment, because these are often entrepreneurs or academics that are doing some degree of technology transfer activities. People come in, investing in those companies and then licensing or patenting that technology to bring it further forward to market. So it feels like a sweet spot for prizes in the technology development life cycle. Well, now you think that there's private interest in investing in private space technologies. But at the time the Ansari XPRIZE was offered, it was really only governments that were going into space; it was pretty hard for new players to break in. So prizes are particularly helpful as a market stimulation or demand-pull mechanism . Not to use overly wonky phrases, but they are one of a class of demand-pull mechanisms where the market might not be fully functioning on its own, where the financial incentives aren't clear enough to create the startup momentum for private sector investment to initially come in. The buyer may be unclear. This is similar to why we see advanced market commitments being offered. It's clarifying that call for that demand for something new and really creating that start at momentum. That is the sweetest spot. Sometimes you might think you're in that spot and you\u2019re not. So we've seen genomics competitions getting outpaced by the private sector investment and the private sector market. While those competitions contributed cool ways of measuring progress in genomics, we probably would have gotten there anyway, because of the market forces at work. I don't think there is, because it is so specific to the state of a given market and the state of a given technology. And I think the way I'd come at your question is that it is not always about cash. Sometimes cash money is the driver for headlines, coverage, and the way in which the public gets attention, but sometimes the most powerful incentives for the entrepreneurs or solvers themselves isn't just the money. It might be the glory, the hardness of the problem. Also, that ability to be tested by a third party and have a third party tell you how effective your technology was against their bar is really attractive for entrepreneurs, who may otherwise lack a place to do that sandboxing and get that feedback from a third party validator. One of my very favorite questions. So President Obama launched a White House Grand Challenges initiative that I helped to lead. A grand challenge is an ambitious yet achievable goal. We call them moonshots today, although we hear the phrase Earthshots being used by the Department of Energy. There are some similarities to prizes. You're making your goal obvious. You're making your goal as specific and measurable as possible, but there's not necessarily an assumption that you're using a prize incentive as the only way to drive progress. Grand challenge efforts like President Obama's BRAIN Initiative in some cases use prize challenges to advance some aspect of the mission, but also use grants, philanthropic partnerships, R&D funding, contracts, even just research agenda setting, in order to make progress. Some of the Department of Energy grand challenges have been powerful because they've convened the people interested in that goal on an annual basis with the thousands of researchers working on making solar cost-competitive with fossil fuels. They're also focused on technology. Often they are thinking about the full picture of what it would take to reach that goal. That ability to say, beyond technology development, \u201cWhat else do we need? What are the market challenges at hand? What are the consumer awareness questions at hand? What unlikely partnerships need to be developed to solve this problem?\u201d So they are related, but you can think of grand challenges as a bigger umbrella in which you're going to use a lot of strategies to go after that big moonshot goal. But I would say it has proven to be. For instance, the Department of Energy was trying to make progress on concrete clean energy issues for buildings, like wireless smart meters and rooftop air chillers. One of the ways they did that was not by putting up new cash, but actually by bringing together the building managers who had a sense of the technology requirements they needed, with companies that could potentially design, develop, test, and deploy those technologies. That is essentially a convening function: setting the table, getting those requirements to be made more explicit, and then translating that into a market demand statement for the build side of industry. We've also seen powerful progress on health research done the same way. The National Eye Institute essentially did an innovation initiative, where they called out promising areas of research. They used their convening function to bring in people who hadn't worked on eye disease issues before, and really set that forward research agenda for the field. There's countless others. To me, it's actually one of the most underutilized, low-lift ways for the federal government to drive progress towards some of these big challenges. I would say that's true both for federal government-offered grand challenges and moonshots and for other organizations that might step into issuing those things\u2026being really crystal clear about your top priorities, right? Whether you\u2019re a federal agency or a local university. After I left the Obama OSTP, I spent time with 25 research universities that were launching their own grand challenge initiatives, which tended to be more locally focused on issues like opioids, or climate resilience, or mental health in the community. Those universities found it really important to pick one or two, maybe three that were their signature initiatives, that were really driving the way they engaged with local elected officials, with philanthropy and with community groups. That clarity of priority was super important. Some mistakes are actually common to both grand challenges and prizes. For instance, poor problem definition is a failure state not just for prizes and grand challenges, but for grants and contracts as well. The ability to reach, as one of my mentors Tom Kalil used to say, the \u201cGoldilocks level\u201d of problem definition, not too vague in that no one can see their part in \u201cwhat would I do to help work toward that goal?\u201d And not so specific that you aren't actually stimulating interest, or you're leaving out a set of disciplines or potential contributors. I wish we could have a class on problem definition for almost everyone working in the federal government. Another failure is not understanding the maturity level in the space you are trying to work in, or, as federal agencies might call it, the technology readiness level. That informs what mechanism you use, whether that's a prize, basic R&D investments, or a more broad grand challenge approach that looks at technology adoption. I've often seen people wade in without understanding, \u201cWhat is the maturity level of the solution I'm trying to advance?\u201d And people get the incentives wrong. The dollar figure might be too low. Sometimes it's just too high! And you've truly scared off people who might say, \u201cWell, there's no way my solution would be eligible for 30 million.\u201d The final one I'd mention is not planning for what comes next. This is a continuum of technology development, and once that prototype exists, what are you going to do to help bring it to market? What happens next? You see plenty of prize competitions that have had their winners fall flat because there's no ready next step for where they go from there. I was at OMB from the start of the Biden administration through January of this year, and I worked as part of the OMB management offices, and I agree, people don't fully understand OMB's broader missions. OMB's responsibilities in developing the president's budget and other supplemental budgetary proposals and requests is somewhat broadly understood. I think that OMB's role in leading the federal regulatory process through OIRA is somewhat broadly understood. As people pay attention to rules that they're tracking, they might interface with that part of OMB. OMB gives advice to the president, like other offices in the Executive Office of the President, and I would shout out the OMB Office of General Counsel for being a particular place of legal interpretation for any administration. But less well understood, I think, is that OMB is a small federal agency in the Executive Office of the President that has a vast amount of current and historical institutional memory. It follows how the implementation of federal programs and operations is happening, where there are long term challenges, unresolved issues, unfinished work under the law that needs to be addressed. Almost no small cadre of federal employees has a more high-elevation view of federal government implementation challenges. Both by statute and administratively, OMB steers the management of federal agencies, including through the President's Management Council with the deputy secretaries of federal agencies, and they work to ensure the federal government operates as an organized enterprise, on topics like procurement and federal financial assistance. I would have to disagree. The OMB career workforce may be tired. They may have had some hard go\u2019s over time, but they are also some of the smartest, most passionate federal employees I've ever had the opportunity to work alongside. There is indeed a small layer of political appointees that come in with any administration. And there are hundreds of career employees, and also detailees and those that come in from other sectors through the Intergovernmental Personnel Act and other fellowship authorities. Those career officials are the primary points of contact to federal agencies on a wide range of issues. OMB people value accuracy. They value historical knowledge and not recreating wheels. They value creativity in the ways you can implement a piece of legislation or an executive order and make sure that's done with effectiveness, with efficiency, with accountability and openness where possible. So when a new executive order is signed by the president or a bill is signed into law, OMB starts by understanding the requirements. These things are usually very complex, very legalistic. Sometimes they need a cheat sheet or a translation into plain English, even for federal agencies. So, you'll see OMB convening the agencies to talk about what just got passed, what just got signed. You'll see OMB issuing guidance to agencies, sometimes in the form of OMB management memoranda, or M-memos as they're called, providing answers to agencies for frequently asked questions about what does this mean, what can I, can't I do. I wish that all law and all executive orders were written in simple language that one could read and understand, but that is not always the case. Then OMB follows up through a variety of mechanisms, whether through interagency councils or specific agency discussions about where deliverables might be behind. Every part of OMB is involved, whether that's the budget teams, which are also called resource management offices, the general counsel's office, who is helping to interpret those new laws or those new executive orders, and even to help draft those executive orders in the first place, and then the teams I got to work with, the management offices of OMB that are looking at different facets, like the procurement aspects, the financial assistance and management aspects, the digital services and technology delivery aspects of those executive orders and legislation. If additional legal clarification is necessary, which is almost always, then OMB is creating a position from the executive branch to the Hill about what new law might be needed to make implementation of this body of work more effective. And OMB convenes the agencies to inform those legislation positions that any administration takes. This is a great example because OMB and OSTP worked very closely with center-of-government agencies like the General Services Administration (GSA), and with specific mission agencies across the federal government. GSA is a key partner to OMB in almost every aspect of supporting federal agency implementation. With prizes, the collaboration started even before any government-wide authorities were passed. We\u2019d seen early government adoption prior to the Obama administration. When the Obama administration came in, OSTP and OMB started to document those examples. On the first day of his administration, President Obama signed a memorandum on open government. The President releases a Strategy for American Innovation in [September] 2009"

Nice is joining the Institute for Progress as Distinguished Immigration Counsel , and is also Distinguished Immigration Scholar at Cornell Law. In this interview, we discuss: How can the U.S. attract and retain more high-skill STEM immigrants? How can existing immigration pathways keep STEM talent in the U.S. for longer? How can you remain focused on your priorities in a job at the White House? Recently, Nice served at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) as Assistant Director for International Science and Technology Workforce. She practiced at Dickstein Shapiro, served in the Office of General Counsel in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and was executive director of immigration policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. For a printable transcript of this piece, click here: I joined OSTP in June 2021. I led the STEM immigration policy portfolio, focusing on federal agency policies that could help attract and retain international STEM talent. On my first day, I arrived with a little leather folder that contained a bullet list of problems I wanted to work on. I asked my boss: \u201cWhat sort of approval process do I follow to get started?\u201d He said: \u201cJust get started. If you run into problems, let us know.\u201d I had four things topping my list: First, I wanted to increase the number of fields that were eligible for the Optional Practical Training Extension for STEM Students (STEM OPT). International students with F-1 visas \u2014 required for them to attend U.S. colleges and universities \u2014 who received STEM degrees could apply for a two-year extension of their optional practical training (OPT), which would allow them to remain in the U.S. for a total of 36 months to gain practical employment experience related to their field. Our question was: Can we make more fields that meet the existing regulatory definition eligible for the STEM OPT extension? We thought if there were more STEM experts who can live and work in the United States for up to 3 years after earning their degree, this could be consequential, given that nearly three-quarters of STEM OPT participants have earned a masters degree in the U.S. From my previous time at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), I knew someone who leads the DHS Student and Exchange Visitor Program who I thought might be interested in working on this. I reached out and she said: \u201cI\u2019d love to talk with you about that.\u201d We got started in my first week, and DHS announced in January 2022. I also wanted DHS to keep the STEM OPT extension list updated and modernized. We worked with the Office of the General Counsel to regularize the process where stakeholders could nominate fields that involve innovative research or technology to be on the list. The goal was to institutionalize the process, rather than doing it once and forgetting about it again until someone in the future takes it up. Second, I wanted to make it so companies could host J-1 researchers. The J-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa that\u2019s designed for foreign nationals to temporarily stay in the U.S. for specific educational, research, training, or cultural exchange purposes. J-1 gets used by professors, camp counselors, summer interns, and even au pairs, and it\u2019s a program administered by the Department of State. There\u2019s a category for researchers, but it\u2019s primarily used by universities and hospitals. The statute, as written, seemed like it could be used for companies, too, and it seemed the State Department\u2019s existing regulations also permitted it. The J-1 is powerful for people in STEM R&D because it allows them to stay for up to five years, and there are no numerical limits or country caps. I found out a principal reason we hadn\u2019t applied the J-1 researcher visas to companies was that no one had ever thought about focusing on it. This led to the development of the Early Career STEM Research Initiative , which I\u2019m working to help promote outside of government, figuring out how to get people to use it. This experience taught me about the dynamics of certain bureaus \u2014 many of which are looking for ways to have a deliverable that\u2019s useful to the administration. And here was someone from the White House saying \u201cWe think it could be a really cool opportunity to use science and technology policy to facilitate more exchanges with companies in STEM research. What do you think?\u201d Third, I wanted to expand O-1 visas so they could be used regularly by STEM PhDs. A statute enacted in 1990 created the O-1 visa status. When I was in private practice, people in the immigration bar called it the Oprah Visa. It was understood that if you were famous \u2014 or just very notable in some other way \u2014 you could use the O-1. From 1990 to 2022, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and its predecessor agency, never established guidelines on using this category for STEM PhDs. But that didn\u2019t imply that it couldn\u2019t be used. Again, our idea was simple: If we could siphon people who are getting STEM PhDs from the H-1B program and, where qualified, request O-1 instead, we could make the H-1B program more usable without Congress. Also, H-1B is a random lottery at this point, while the O-1 is in your control. There\u2019s no numerical limit and it doesn't have the same cumbersome process that H-1B has. There\u2019s just a very high standard to qualify. Part of the problem for the O-1 was the way the regulation was worded. The agency\u2019s regulation could be read to say we\u2019re looking for people who\u2019ve won a Nobel Prize or people who, alternatively, have three of the following eight criteria. Since the setup is \u201cNobel Prize,\u201d people think they won\u2019t qualify. The truth is, \u201cNobel Prize\u201d is not actually the standard; it\u2019s just what the regulation says as an explanatory predicate. So, the approach was for USCIS to create a working group, and at least for some meetings I was able to attend and actively participate. We went through the eight criteria and provided examples of how someone with a STEM PhD might qualify. Now, outside of government, we have to get the world out to these graduate PhD programs, specifically during their three years of post-completion STEM OPT. Would you qualify for an O-1? What are the steps you have to take? Not everyone will qualify, but if they knew the pathway, they\u2019d have more certainty. Finally, I was interested in providing more objective criteria to STEM graduate students on how they could access the National Interest Waiver (NIW) for permanent resident status. Immigrants who are engaged in endeavors that are in the national interest can self-petition for permanent resident status. We weren\u2019t able to create any new numbers for permanent resident status \u2014 only Congress can \u2014 but our idea was to create more certainty and predictability. We might get more people to use this category if we could provide more objective criteria about how it applies to both STEM masters and PhD candidates. It has been on the books since 1990, but there\u2019s never been any guidance. We wrote about 15 pages of guidance outlining how this works. We also said that if you\u2019re working in a critical and emerging technology field, that\u2019s in the national interest. We linked to an OSTP report identifying fields of critical and emerging technologies, and created a useful, accessible resource. This also has the benefit of helping our own government. Another measure of work that\u2019s in the national interest is work that\u2019s relevant to an interested government agency. Again, this is not rocket science, there's like no insight here. This was always permitted, but it was never announced. There\u2019s a whole section about this in this guidance, describing how an interested government agency can play a role. After the policy guidance was announced, we had a briefing for just the science and technology directorates at different agencies, and there were 42 different agency staff that listened in, representing over a dozen agencies. Very few of them are actually using it yet, but we created an awareness that this was a new thing they could, in fact, use. Amy Nice What did you do before working in the White House? I worked for 20+ years in private practice, and, in 2010, I left to work on immigration policy. I had a variety of roles for 10+ years before coming to the White House, covering legislative reform, rulemaking processes, and coalition building among outside stakeholders. By the time I got this mysterious call from the guy who would become my boss at OSTP, I had learned how to get things done in the arena of immigration law and policy. One of my adult children told me, \u201cMom, it\u2019s like you\u2019ve been training for 30 years for this job that you didn\u2019t even know existed.\u201d My most important experience to prepare for the White House was working at the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 learning how the bureaucracy works, and trying to pass legislative reforms for years as the executive director for immigration policy at a large business association, coordinating with the Hill. In both my agency and legislative efforts I came to know that people, process, and politics can complicate everything. I spent a lot of time at the beginning trying to figure it out. I was distracted by everything that was getting thrown at me. I realized pretty quickly that I needed to focus on the smallest possible thing that wasn\u2019t meaningless. I wanted to figure out what I could do as one human. That was the impetus to become very focused on my bulleted list of top priorities. I jumped in, identifying the specific tasks that I would undertake. I knew I was not going to master everything that was happening in the White House. But you can be very effective just by being sensitive to the politics, the people, and the process that surrounds you. But don\u2019t let it consume you, because by the time you figure that all out, it\u2019ll be time to wrap up. Ultimately, I learned that one person can make a difference. If you believe in your thing, if you\u2019re enthusiastic about your thing, and if you're a technical expert about your thing, you will find people in the bureaucracy who share your interests. You can\u2019t actually get that much done from the White House unless you have career officials, staff, policy analysts, lawyers, and politically appointed leaders who believe in what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s very easy for departments and agencies to never get around to your initiative. I worked on projects that became policies and were announced \u2014 and they probably wouldn\u2019t have happened if I wasn\u2019t there, but it was not rocket science. I was just enthusiastic, and I was a little bit relentless. Departments and agencies would say they have a lot of priorities, but I wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer and would always look to be a partner. I would do research, provide papers, and do analysis. A lot of times that work ended up in the agency's document because they realized I had done the work for them. My big takeaways were: In the White House, it\u2019s easy to be overwhelmed by all you don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t force it. It\u2019ll come to you eventually. Take initiative. Don\u2019t wait for the assignment to come to you. Think five steps ahead. You can make a difference. Some people, depending on where they are in their career, think that just having the job is enough. No, that wasn\u2019t enough for me. I wanted to see what I could get done. I appreciated my experience so much. I loved everything about my little corner office with five other quantum science guys, the 20-foot ceilings, and the marble staircases. I made a point, every day that I was in person for 18 months, to walk out of the EOB on the Navy Steps side of the building facing the White House, instead of the 17th Street side which was closer to my walk to the Metro, just because I wanted to have that experience \u2014 to realize, I survived another day. 21 3 1 Share Previous Next Discussion about this post Comments Restacks Leah Libresco Sargeant Nov 16, 2023 Liked by Santi Ruiz This is so excellent.

Reply Share 1 reply Antoinette Uiterdijk Nov 15, 2023 Edited It can be done so much more simple. If you need a high level worker, issue him a Green Card. This means you can under current regulation ask for his police certificates - to rule out a criminal past - and a medical examination. Same for his spouse. Make the Green Card a conditional Green Card, that needs to be turned into a permanent one, if the worker makes his promises come true. With a permanent Green Card the worker has the same rights and options as a US citizen when it comes to being an employee. He can no longer be used to force other workers to work more hours, take less income home. With this schedule a Green Card could be issued in 6-9 months. It would save a lot of unnecessary action at USCIS and the State Department. It would also mean significant less stress and misery for the foreign worker. He would know after two years if his future is in the US or not. Going back to the home country would still a viable option re. a job search over there. For the wives of the workers it would make a difference comparable to heaven vs. hell. But, why would you do something in a sensible way, if you can make it a bureaucratic nightmare ? Loved by civil servants and lawyers alike ! I speak from experience. How many work-bound immigrants has Ms. Nice talked to ? What Ms. Nice proposes will probably bring in more foreign students, hoping to be able to stay here. But she forgets that many talented people have gone to foreign universities, worked abroad. That mix of different experiences is exactly what often makes foreign workers valuable. Especially when a co. builds products intended to be sold all over the world ! Interestingly, in this whole interview, the H-4 visa and the built-in cruelty of this visa, is never mentioned. Of course H-4's are mainly women, mostly from India. so who cares. Edit: a need many US businesses have from time to time is again not addressed. Which is, a really short term work-visa (up to six months) for engineers etc. to implement a foreign product of piece of machinery. This is currently done, sometimes, on a restrictive and confusing B-1 in lieu of an H-1B visa, but more often these workers come on the Visa Waiver Program/ESTA. Easy-peasy for the foreign employer but dangerous for the worker, as he is the one that can be hit by penalties if it turns out the work is a real short-term job. A short term work-visa, quickly issued to eligible candidates, would be a real improvement. Another idea would be to give foreign workers the option to turn an IRA or 401-k into an Individual Return Account by allowing them to take the money out tax-free and without penalties, when they indeed leave to return to their homeland. If you want people to \"go back to where you came from\" like I was invited to do so many times, the US should put money where the mouth is. Reply Share 1 more comment...

Peter Weir\u2019s cult classic suggests that something is lost in a world without hierarchy. Peter Weir\u2019s cult classic suggests that something is lost in a world without hierarchy. When Robert Peel was appointed Under-Secretary for war and the colonies for Great Britain in 1810, in the middle of the greatest war it had seen, he was only twenty-two. On his appointment, he received a letter from his dean at Christ Church Oxford. \u201cWork very hard and unremittingly,\u201d it said. \u201cWork, as I used to say sometimes, like a tiger, or like a dragon, if dragons work more and harder than tigers. Do not be afraid of killing yourself.\u201d The Napoleonic Wars were won by young men entrusted with incredible amounts of responsibility, and callow youths did work themselves to death as clerks in the offices of Whitehall. William Pitt the Younger died at the age of 46 after years of sickness, leached of his health by serving in the role of wartime prime minister for fully half his life. His departments were staffed and led by as many 20-year-olds as 60- and 70-year olds. In Peter Weir\u2019s Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World , we see the other ways young men won the war, in gory detail. The elfin 13-year-old midshipman William \u201cLord\u201d Blakeney has his arm amputated, of course sans anesthesia. The film is about homosociality in all its guts and glory, from the friendship between Dr. Stephen Maturin and Captain Jack Aubrey that undergirds it, to the closed-ranks the ship\u2019s crew present to the unlucky Midshipman Hollum, an eventual suicide. Master and Commander , which celebrates its 20th anniversary today, was not a smash box office hit (it came in second in 2003\u2019s Christmas season, to Elf ). But it has reemerged as a cult classic, a phenomenon for which observers advance different explanations. In March, GQ asked \u201cWhy Are So Many Guys Obsessed With Master and Commander?\u201d and sourced a cluster of predominantly New York leftist men to explain their affections. GQ \u2019s writer hastens to point out that the movie is \u201cbeloved by a certain type of guy (gender neutral)\u201d and that \u201cany nostalgia for the traditionalism in the movie is less reactionary and more about the healthy male bonding between the characters.\u201d This is not really true. There\u2019s plenty of unhealthy men with unhealthy relationships: see the bullying of a colleague into killing himself. But there is \u201chealthy\u201d male bonding in the movie and the original novels by Patrick O\u2019Brian. Aubrey and Maturin are a fully realized friendship, a kind of Frodo-Sam pairing in which the guys don\u2019t just suffer together but actually commune. That relationship keeps the novels and movie from being just a genre fiction jaunt. The novels themselves, fans will inform you, are formally titled the Aubrey-Maturin series. (I have read 11 of the novels, enough to be considered a grade A nerd but not enough to claim real expertise.) That series is more expository than the movie, and has a particular appeal to the autistic and their fellow-travelers. O\u2019Brian has a habit of using the landlubber Maturin as a foil for the explanation of nautical facts and mechanisms. By contrast, the heavily memed title screen of the film contains all the necessary exposition: Oceans Are Now Battlefields . Critics in 2003 poked at it for a plot that landed \u201c On the Far Side of Credibility ,\u201d as the New York Times \u2019 Jason Epstein put it. Even critics like Epstein appreciated how accurately the film captured details of the period and the nature of war on a ship at sea: the long stretches of grinding maintenance tasks, mending rope or sails, punctuated by achingly slow pursuits. Those tasks were mirrored by massive systems of regimented production on the homefront. As Roger Knight puts it in his excellent history Britain Against Napoleon , \u201cThe foundations of military victory lay in\u2026the diligence of shipbuilders and the makers of ropes.\u201d Care in craft played an essential role in military success. The underground water storage tanks built at Gibraltar during the war for the British Navy were still in use in this century. But Master and Commander is a compelling dude movie principally because it presents a world of organized, coordinated busyness among the members of a tight-knit warband. Like the ancient Indo-European comitatus , the crew of HMS Surprise is tied to its leader by an explicit oath of fealty. Under the leadership of someone like Russell Crowe\u2019s Aubrey, that warband can be incredibly effective, and that leadership turns the terrible drudgery of work on the open sea into something fulfilling. Zones of action that hold out the promise of coordinated, task-oriented grand achievement will always be attractive to young men: space, the ocean, Silicon Valley. The Napoleonic wars, in their naval form, were won by thousands of these cadres, toiling away beyond civilized life. Regimented systems of command and control, combined with communication difficulties, put tremendous pressure on relatively green leaders to make decisions that could be justified to the Admiralty. The lives of the men fictionalized in Master and Commander were profoundly unfree. Their paths were often set before they\u2019d reached puberty, or forced upon them by press gangs. What contemporary viewers envy them is not their diet, or the health of their teeth, or their romantic lives. It\u2019s the doing things together, the pulling toward the same goal and experiencing glory in doing so. The forms of communal life that permit that don\u2019t tend to be presented to teens and late zoomers; they\u2019re counseled to spend as much of their time as possible learning about the world and themselves before committing to a particular path. Master and Commander suggests that the constraint of being under authority, in its best form, might be something valuable. This is not a paywall!

    "keywords": "The decisions that humans make can be extraordinarily costly. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were multi-trillion-dollar decisions. If you can improve the accuracy of forecasting individual strategies by just a percentage point, that would be worth tens of billions of dollars. Yet society does not invest tens of billions of dollars in figuring out how to improve the accuracy of human judgment. That seems really odd. That\u2019s a quote from today\u2019s interviewee, who has made his career helping the intelligence community predict the future better. In this interview, we discuss: Which prediction methods perform the best? How does IARPA create tech for American spies? What technologies give democracies an advantage over autocracies? Could the Internet have been designed better? Our interviewee, Jason Matheny, championed research into human judgment and forecasting at the R&D lab for the intelligence community: the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, or IARPA , which he directed from 2015-2018. As one bio notes , Matheny spent time in academia \u2014 Oxford University, Princeton University, and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory \u2014 and the startup world before joining IARPA. He developed new forecasting capabilities at IARPA\u2019s \u201cOffice for Anticipating Surprise,\u201d has spent time in the Biden White House, and now runs the RAND Corporation, a major think tank. [ This interview was originally published in 2023, at this link, without the audio: Statecraft was still transcript-only then. ] For a printable transcript of this interview, click here: The basic ARPA model is hiring entrepreneurial program managers who are given a budget and autonomy to pick \u201chigh-risk, high-reward\u201d research problems. The program managers select researchers to fund, based either on their individual judgment or the judgment of a small selection panel. Then those researchers compete in parallel against a common set of metrics, usually with some disciplined approach to ending funding every year for teams that aren't succeeding. The three core and unusual elements are the program managers, research tournaments, and defunding research that isn\u2019t succeeding. They distinguish the ARPA model from conventional science and technology funding efforts. Program managers are recruited by office directors, typically on the basis of technical knowledge, an entrepreneurial mindset, creativity, risk tolerance, and predicted ability to succeed in pitching and executing a program. The program manager candidates make a program pitch based on the Heilmeier questions [ guiding principles for choosing ARPA programs ]. They go through multiple rounds of review, first with the office director who serves as a gatekeeper. There are other characteristics to program managers that are important. Typically, they need to get a security clearance. Program managers are given very little training or management. The main performance measure is whether you get your program approved. That process is like a cross between a dissertation defense and a pitch to a venture capitalist. The goal is ultimately to persuade this group of people that your idea could be transformative if successful. Some projects are too risky. If the premise is, \u201cIf successful, this would be transformative, but in order to be successful I have to violate the following laws of physics,\u201d or, \u201cI have to solve a problem that Nobel laureates haven't managed to solve in the last 50 years,\u201d that's going to be deemed too risky. There\u2019s some Goldilocks zone of appropriate probabilities, probably under 50% and over 5%. There are then problems that aren't risky enough, that are seen as \u201cnot ARPA-hard,\u201d even if those problems, if solved, could be transformative. Really, just from a policy point of view, what you would love is low-risk, high-reward research. You shouldn't disqualify a research project just because it turns out that it would be easier to solve. Ultimately, you should be optimizing based on the cost benefit of a particular research investment. ARPAs do not tend to go after transformative but easy problems, even if the reason they haven't been solved is because they're neglected or ignored. That's right. Across the portfolio of federal agencies that fund R&D, the comparative advantage for the ARPAs is to focus on higher-risk research. The point of having entrepreneurial program managers with relatively little oversight is to give them the ability to go after high-risk research. IARPA developed a process that we called research technology protection: Before any program started, we would do a cost-benefit analysis of making the program secret or not. It included questions like, \u201cWhere are the researchers to solve this problem? Are they in academia?\u201d In which case, most of them don't have security clearances, so we wouldn't be able to access them. If the program is secret, \u201cDoes it require a mix of academics and contractors? Does it require crowdsourcing itself to solve? Do we want to pose the problem as a prize challenge, to give it to the world to solve?\u201d You want to figure that out in advance and decide whether the costs of secrecy exceed the benefits or vice versa. And it really depends. I thought of some problems as much better to keep secret. But then you actually do the math, and you find the benefits of secrecy aren't so significant, and we wouldn't be able to solve the problem in secret. With others, the opposite is true. Stealth technology, for example, would be in the high-risk, high-reward space. That was a historic DARPA (and Air Force) investment. We had models for significantly reducing the radar cross section of an aircraft, but those models produced designs that we couldn't figure out how to fly. That was technically risky. But the impact on military operations, if successful, was going to be transformative. It would mean that you could have aircraft that were penetrating your defense zones. That's a classic case of an ARPA-hard problem that benefited from having program managers who were constructive contrarians, despite being told, \u201cIt just won't be aerodynamically feasible to design an aircraft with such a small cross section.\u201d An example of a project that isn't ARPA-hard: solving a problem that the commercial sector is going to solve in a year anyway, like a better camera for a cell phone. It's not clear that it's super risky because advances are happening in these commercial cameras all the time. The counterfactual, of the world in which an ARPA doesn't invest in that, is that ultimately those advances get made anyway. Faster-than-light travel. Maybe there are tachyons that are achieving faster-than-light speeds. But figuring out how to leverage that is probably beyond the risk tolerance of an ARPA program. What are you trying to do? How is it done today? What are the limits of current practice? What is new in your approach? And why do you think it will be successful? Who cares? What difference will it make? How much will it cost? How long will it take? What are the midterm and final exams to check for success, (which basically means: how do you evaluate that you're succeeding or failing)? Those questions are deceptively simple, but they help to guide one's approach to designing a program. So I love the ARPA model. I think it's a great alternative to a lot of traditional science and technology funding. There's also some blind spots. For instance, the Heilmeier questions don't have a question about counterfactual impact: \u201cWould this work get done otherwise?\u201d The office tends not to rigorously assess the other funding streams going to solve this particular problem, and their likelihoods of success. We also tend not to think much about strategic move and countermove. Particularly in national security, where different actors are competing against one another in technology, we probably should think more about baking security and safety into the technologies we create. For example, are there ways of making a technology less prone to reverse engineering, to theft, to misuse? Because many things that the U.S. government funds get stolen, even when we classify them. It probably is prudent to assign at least a 10% probability to some exquisite, classified technology being stolen. So you should think in advance: \u201cWill I be better or worse off having developed this technology if it's stolen?\u201d By making certain research programs known, you create a security dilemma: you prompt foreign intelligence services into thinking that you're planning to use some new offensive weapon. You need to be thoughtful about what information can be misinterpreted by others if they're aware of an investment. We also tend to overestimate our ability to keep secrets. In part, when you're operating in a classified environment, you're so aware of the protections: the guards, the guns, the gates, the special rooms with air gapping and no electronic devices. The environment creates so many inconveniences to go in and out, you assign a high level of confidence to it. But there are so many historical instances of our protections failing that we should be more realistic about the base rate of things getting stolen. That has implications for the research that we pursue and how we pursue it. For example, if you develop a technology that would actually create an asymmetric disadvantage if used against you. That strategic analysis isn't inherent in the DARPA Heilmeier questions or the ARPA Heilmeier questions. We continued to use the Heilmeier questions, but we wanted to get at how competitors are going to respond to a technology being developed. So we developed some additional questions: What's your estimate about how long it would take a major nation competitor to weaponize this technology after they learn about it? What's your estimate for a non-state terrorist group with resources like those of Al Qaeda in the first decade of the century? If the technology is leaked, stolen, or copied, would we regret having developed it? What first mover advantage is likely to endure after a competitor follows? How could the program be misinterpreted by foreign intelligence? Do you have any suggestions for reducing that risk? Can we develop defensive capabilities before or alongside offensive ones? Can the technology be made less prone to theft, replication, and mass production? What design features could create barriers to entry? What red team activities could help answer these questions? Whose red team opinions would you particularly respect? Red teaming is a really important check on the strategic value of a particular technology, and it's not done frequently enough. We typically start research programs in the ARPAs without having somebody assigned to thinking, \u201cImagine we're successful. What are you going to do in response to this technology that we've just created? How are you going to counter it?\u201d We don't do enough red teaming in general. Sometimes it's just awkward, because you're trying to beat the stuff that you're investing a lot of money and time to building. You're not highly motivated to see the ways that it breaks. There are institutional and even personal incentives not to explore the ways in which your own investment is potentially vulnerable. Also, it takes time and investment, and that trades off against efforts that are seen as more within the \u201cjob jar\u201d of an R&D agency. But in fact, it\u2019s one of our best ways of identifying vulnerabilities early and creating countermeasures. The ARPAs could say, \u201cIt\u2019s not our job to figure out how to break our own technology.\u201d But it's not clear any agency is better qualified. You need folks who are going to be sincere about trying to break it, who aren't friends with the program manager, who are sufficiently separated as honest brokers. Most ARPA programs will have testing and evaluation teams. Those roles are typically played by a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC), or a university-affiliated research center, which are able to leverage private sector expertise, but have reliable enough funding that they don't have to worry about irritating the government. They can just be trusted to tell the truth. They're also temperamentally selected to tell the truth even if it's unpopular. Places like RAND , IDA , the Center for Naval Analysis and others are magnets for nerds who are honest to a fault. The ARPAs then put the FFRDCs to work in evaluating whether the program is successful. They are typically not put to work on the other side, which is, \u201cNow pretend that you're our enemy and are figuring out how to counter this technology, or figure out how you're going to put it to use once you\u2019ve stolen it.\u201d I think the institutions already exist to carry out that work: they're just not typically asked to do it. Again, in the cyber realm, we have organizations that focus on red teaming and pentests , and there are competitions, like Defcon, in which that red team activity is celebrated. We don't do that as systematically in national security. There's no permanent red team at the National Security Council (NSC) that tries to anticipate how China will respond to a particular US action. It might be incredibly valuable for that to exist. What\u2019s the relationship between IARPA and the intelligence community like? So IARPA is similar to DARPA: it has the same overall model of program managers, programs run like research tournaments, and a rigorous process for stopping funding for things that aren't working. The main difference is that our end user is the intelligence community, which is a collection of 18 agencies that collect, analyze, interpret, and protect information for US decision makers. The goal of IARPA is to fund advanced research that ultimately improves decision advantage. The intelligence community is maybe 1/10th the size of the Defense Department. And because things don't need to be mass-produced, you don\u2019t need as many pieces of equipment for the intelligence community compared to the DoD, the problems that are worked on can be one-offs. You might just need to build a single device, or five of a device. Because there's often a greater premium on secrecy, there's more thinking about the security around technology efforts. In some cases, that includes preventing it from even being recognized as an area of research. The technology base is different for DARPA. There\u2019s a lot of established defense contractors. The intelligence community will often have contractors that are smaller and less well known for security reasons [ for more on these reasons, see IARPA: A Modified DARPA Innovation Model ] . All the program managers require a TSSCI clearance. That's not true of DARPA, where most of the program managers might have secret or top-secret clearances. In some ways it can open it up because if you don't have to mass produce something, then the technical space of options offers more degrees of freedom. The problem of collection is typically in collecting electrons or photons, so those end up being physics and electrical engineering problems. There's also chemistry problems, since we're increasingly concerned about misuses of biology, so figuring out how to analyze chemical signatures of biological activity is important. And the analysis side certainly does involve things like statistics, computer science, and machine learning research. But ultimately, decision making is predominantly human, and the psychology of cognitive biases and heuristics is really important. There's been more room for investing in research, human judgment, and in cognitive psychology compared to the other ARPAs. Then there's the problem of information protection, and there it's back to physics and engineering problems. On the protection side, it's a cat-and-mouse game of trying to figure out how you would counter all of the clever things that you're doing to collect information. I became interested after reading the book Expert Political Judgment by Phil Tetlock, which is one of the more ambitious pieces of research on the accuracy of human judgment about policymaking. Part of the reason for working on those problems at IARPA was that they seemed neglected, relative to what the societal benefit could be for US decision-making in national security and foreign policy. Over a 20-year period, Tetlock evaluated the accuracy of forecasts from a bunch of different participants about world events and found that the accuracy wasn't substantially better than random chance, in many cases. The decisions that humans make can be extraordinarily costly. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were multi-trillion-dollar decisions. If you can improve the accuracy of forecasting individual strategies by just a percentage point, that would be worth tens of billions of dollars. Yet society does not invest tens of billions of dollars in figuring out how to improve the accuracy of human judgment. That seems really odd. You really can substantially improve human judgment through a few interventions that are pretty robust, over different cohorts of people, over different periods of time, over different kinds of analytic questions. I was lucky that I had great bosses. They weren\u2019t completely convinced that the methods were necessarily going to work, but they recognized the value of methods that would work and were willing to take the risk. The Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper , Robert Cardillo as Deputy for intelligence integration, and Stephanie Sullivan as Principal Deputy Director: the three of them supported and protected this research. We also took a particular approach: setting up a repeatable process to evaluate methods, rather than picking which horse was going to win in advance. That created an experimental test bed in which you could evaluate a bunch of different analytic methods for their accuracy, and some of them could be based on human judgment. Some of them can be based on machine learning. Some of them could be based on a combination. Then you could run them all in a forecasting tournament to see whether they're making accurate forecasts about real-world events. The goal really was to create an observatory in which different kinds of methods could be compared to one another and tested for accuracy. Here\u2019s the math intuition: that if you think of a human judgment as (truth + random error + systematic bias), when you take the average of a bunch of human judgments, you're tending to cancel out the random error. And if those judgments are diverse, based on different sources of information and different mental models, that will tend to cancel out systematic bias, so your estimate is going to get closer to the truth. This goes all the way back to Francis Galton and his experiments of getting crowds to estimate the weight of an ox. The work that we did at IARPA in the ACE program and in forecasting tournaments that followed supported this notion. There is a way of improving on that: finding subsets of people who are consistently more accurate than others, \u201c superforecasters ,\u201d and then taking the average of their judgments. It's still, though, taking an average of relatively large numbers of judgments, as opposed to simply taking the super-duper-forecaster who's consistently #1. Methods of picking a single individual didn\u2019t perform well, even if it was cherry picking the single best individual for a particular field. That's an important insight into analytic accuracy that not many institutions have adopted. That's peculiar, because it's a research finding that's been pretty robust across different subjects, and many institutions should be highly motivated to increase their accuracy. I don't have good answers to that question. It's something that Robin Hanson has a pretty cynical hypothesis about; that the leaders of most institutions aren't primarily motivated by increasing accuracy, but are more motivated by protecting their own status, or those of senior leaders. Crowdsourcing is inherently disruptive to lea"

Nick Land, who coined the term, is a misanthrope. He doesn\u2019t like humans much, so the idea that there could be an entity coming, already being born, drawing itself into existence by hyperstitionally preying on the dreams of humanity, cannibalizing their desires, wearing \u201cthe invisible hand\u201d as an ideological skin: he\u2019s into that. \u201cTechno-economic interactivity crumbles social order in auto-sophisticating machine runaway,\u201d as he would put it, and that\u2019s good . You\u2019re being colonized by an entity that doesn\u2019t care about you, except insofar as you make a good host. There are other technocapital advocates. Nyx Land inherits the original Land\u2019s misanthropy and adds gender dysphoria. Technocapital is good because, in the long run, it turns boys into women, in the same way that industrial chemicals turn the frogs gay and warmer oceans make turtles female . Read the blackpaper . \u201cThe liberation of the female sex by acceleration in general, towards maximizing productive potential under such a time that the male is no longer needed.\u201d There\u2019s no place in the hyperstitional future for individual action, protection of the household, physical labor, or other typically male traits: the inhuman will reproduce itself, the human will die away, and good riddance. Subscribe These boosters of techno-capital like it because it\u2019s an end in itself, which lets them avoid asking questions about the ends of man himself. Which is why it\u2019s odd to see the same ideas used for ostensibly pro-human political projects. Marc Andreessen cites the first Land, approvingly, in his new Techno-Optimist Manifesto . \u201cCombine technology and markets and you get what Nick Land has termed the technocapital machine, the engine of perpetual material creation, growth, and abundance.\u201d Andreessen is consciously bastardizing Land here, because what he terms \u201cperpetual creation growth and abundance,\u201d Land understands as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Andreessen, a Straussian, likes to do this with his sources. The first quote of the essay is from Walker Percy, who sees individuals trapped within technological society. Andreessen uses him to make the argument that only technological society can free us from the things that entrap us. It\u2019s a neat inversion, but it doesn\u2019t work. Thinkers like Percy, or Heidegger, or Land, or Byung-Chul Han, think we\u2019re shaped by technocapital (or by modernity, if you like). They suggest, and this is obvious to anyone who is reading this on social media, that technologies make us different kinds of people. This isn\u2019t always bad, but it\u2019s always the case, they say: I\u2019m not the same person as I was before I used the phone, or the food delivery service, or the chatbot. And according to Heidegger, this changing process is always happening even if I\u2019m not using the specific piece of technology. I could cut lumber with the same ax as my grandfather did, but if I now supply that lumber to the industrial mill, I am \u201cstanding reserve\u201d for that mechanical process. By seeing technologically, I risk losing a part of myself. Psychopolitics, Byung-Chul Han Andreessen isn\u2019t interested in this dynamic, not on the surface of the text. Instead, \u201chuman wants and needs are infinite,\u201d and technology is simply the vector for the fulfillment of those needs. Those needs generate more market demand, which generates more innovation, which generates more wants and needs, and the machine rolls on. Once I sat with my friends and listened to a well known biotechnologist speak about defeating death. This technologist spoke about their mom growing older, and how impossibly painful it was to watch, and how, if all things worked out, the doctors would soon be able to remove her mother\u2019s head just before death, freeze it, slice the brain up into wafer-thin pieces, and reconstruct her consciousness in a vat. (More on this in another essay.) I think about my mom getting older too, although my hope is in the life of the world to come and not in a surgeon removing her head. But that vision of technology, as weird and eldritch and sinister as it may be, is more human than the Landian/Andreessenian vision. The L/A view is of the glory of the runaway machine, its size and our tiny scale. Andreessen dismisses my view as so much sentimental nonsense: \u201cLove doesn\u2019t scale.\u201d This evening, I talked to my son, who didn\u2019t exist in any form a year and a half ago, and who now stares at me adoringly and uncomprehendingly while I try and point out the zucchini on the right of his tray table and the banana on his left. He just gazes at me and smiles and then slowly giggles as I talk. And he\u2019s a 150% return on familial investment, with almost limitless potential for further personal and genetic line growth. By contrast, when Andreessen lauds people and the human, it\u2019s for their ability to be plugged into the technocapital machine. \u201cPeople are the ultimate resource \u2013 with more people come more creativity, more new ideas, and more technological progress.\u201d There is a dangerous contradiction that he avoids, though: \u201cWe believe material abundance therefore ultimately means more people \u2013 a lot more people \u2013 which in turn leads to more abundance.\u201d But this is the opposite dynamic to what we\u2019ve seen play out in every country in the world, that birth rates decline as material abundance increases. Perhaps the artificial womb beckons. To be clear, I\u2019m in Andreessen\u2019s camp in more ways than one, I like technological progress, and I work for an institution dedicated to it. Silicon Valley techno-optimism is an improvement over many ideological projects. But I\u2019m a techno-optimist because I think the only way out is through, and that technology must be made to serve human ends. Without a better philosophy of what a human is for, and a higher view of humans than of the technocapital machine, it\u2019s just a vehicle for Land\u2019s creatures from beyond the void. Subscribe I\u2019ve been off schedule for the past two months. I\u2019ll be trying to publish something, anything, twice a month going forward.

    "keywords": "When the Soviet Union fell in 1991, hundreds of tons of nuclear materials were suddenly unsecured. The new, fragile Russian government had no ability or desire to claim facilities in formerly Soviet states like Georgia and Kazakhstan, and it could no longer pay nuclear plant workers. Operatives from Iran, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea offered cash to purchase uranium and hire nuclear physicists. If not for urgent action by American diplomats and their foreign partners, a rogue state or terrorist group could have acquired a nuclear weapon. How did the US secure dangerous nuclear materials? Why didn\u2019t the Department of Energy want the US to acquire them? Why shouldn\u2019t you bring bourbon to Soviet functionaries? Today\u2019s interviewee can answer these questions better than anyone. As his DARPA biography outlines , Andy Weber led the removal of weapons-grade uranium from Kazakhstan and Georgia, and nuclear-capable MiG-29 aircraft from Moldova, to reduce biological weapons threats, and to destroy Libyan and Syrian chemical weapons stockpiles. He has spent thirty years in the US government, including more than five years as President Obama's Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Programs. In addition, he coordinated US leadership of the international Ebola response for the Department of State. Andy Weber (right) and the head of security for the Ulba plant, in front of trucks full of highly enriched uranium After the fall of the Soviet Union, you were trying to secure nuclear materials in those former Soviet states. Where were you getting your intelligence? We had access to all source intelligence, ranging from SIGINT (signals intelligence) to HUMINT (human intelligence), and open source intelligence. Then there was another form of intelligence that I called \u201cGOINT\u201d or \u201cASKINT.\u201d That's when you get on the plane and you go to the site, or talk to the government, or visit the facility and talk to the scientists. After the Soviet Union collapsed, the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program gave us a reason to be there. Being on the ground was our best source of information. The amount of non-espionage intelligence that we were able to gather, just in the course of our business, was truly extraordinary. It depended on the level I was serving at. When I was at the Pentagon, we would get our morning take of intelligence and we would read it. When I was more senior, serving at the Assistant Secretary of Defense level, I actually had a briefer assigned to me who would come in several times a week, with the analysts who wrote the more in-depth reports, to brief me on different intelligence topics. But I was an avid consumer of intelligence. I read the so-called raw intelligence: the signals, intelligence reports, the CIA human reports. When you put it all together, it gave you a good picture. There were times when specific intelligence led us to action. Some of the projects I was originally involved in were based on very sensitive intelligence. I had a lot of interaction with individuals, and that gave me a good sense of who was telling me the truth, and who was just blowing smoke. The ability to size up people and know whether or not to trust them was an invaluable skill for reading intelligence. You learn to evaluate the sourcing. Usually in human intelligence, there's a source description that describes not just the reliability of the source, but the chain in which he received the information, whether it was information that he had direct access to, or whether he was talking to third parties or more indirectly. Understanding that was very important. I think there's a tendency to overvalue things based on the classification. Just because something is classified or top secret doesn't mean it's true or correct. Especially in crisis situations, you are just flooded with information, and a lot of it is bad information. In a crisis, the collection is amplified, and anybody who thinks they have something to add will send in a report. The quality filter is lower. But when I served as Assistant Secretary of Defense, I had a fantastic relationship with my briefers from the CIA, the NSA, and the DIA , and I did something that not all policymakers do. Oftentimes, I would go out to them and see them on their turf, whether it was up at Fort Meade, or at Langley, or down in Charlottesville, where we had a DIA group focused on weapons of mass destruction issues. I got to know them too. It was really important, as a good consumer, to have a relationship with your intelligence analysts. I just learned so much. The expertise these people have is not written down. So much of it is in their heads, because an intelligence analyst has the luxury of spending all of their time narrowly focused on one thing. They read everything imaginable about it, and, although they're trained not to give policy recommendations, what\u2019s in their heads can certainly help define options and allow policymakers to bounce ideas off of them. It was a process of quite a few months. Slava was my car mechanic, a fixer kind of person, and occasionally my driver. He asked me one day if I'd be interested in buying some uranium. No. And this was at a time when the Soviet Union had collapsed, so there were all kinds of scams, crazy stories about suitcase nuclear weapons. Oftentimes on the black market, they would offer actual plutonium, or what they\u2019d claim was highly enriched uranium for sale. But it was very small quantities, much less than a gram, and they would say, \u201cThis is just a sample, but there's much more behind it if you're interested.\u201d We would actually observe these scams through signals intelligence and other intelligence when they were targeting countries like Libya and Iran, who they knew were interested in buying these things. Most of these stories didn't check out, but I told him that I would be interested in learning more. Sometimes, as in this specific case, which ended up being called Project Sapphire. My initial discussion with Slava led to an introduction with the director of a factory in east Kazakhstan, at Ust\u2019-Kamenogorsk . He was a director of the Ulba Metallurgical Factory named Vitaly Mette, and he had direct access and knowledge of everything that was going on at his factory. It took me many months, and a lot of developing personal rapport and trust, before I got any detailed or usable information about potential uranium at his facility. There were a lot of dinners, a lot of vodka. Once, I made the mistake of giving him a gift of a bottle of Wild Turkey during one of my visits up north to his apartment in Ust'-Kamenogorsk, and he proceeded to say thank you, opened it, and immediately said, \u201cOkay, now we\u2019ll finish this together.\u201d But the time I remember best is, after a meeting in Almaty, which is very far from Ust'-Kamenogorsk, we talked about hunting. He knew I was a hunter, and it was maybe late October. He said, \u201cWhy don't you come up to Ust'-Kamenogorsk? I'll take you hunting.\u201d I said sure. One weekend, I went up there on a hunting trip with him. At the base camp, we did naked banya with his hunting guide friends. That was really important in eventually uncovering what was at his factory. It was first snow early in the morning when we went on the hunt. I actually shot a moose on that trip. A KNB lieutenant colonel fell asleep in his Jeep, trying to stay warm. He woke up, and there was an elk that had walked right past the Jeep, and he pulled out his nine-millimeter Makarov pistol and shot the elk. It was a lot of drinking, and the banya, and salted dried fish and vodka. We really bonded. But he didn't tell me any specifics about the uranium. I said, \u201cLook, the United States government might be interested in purchasing this, but we need to know the details. What's the enrichment level?\u201d Because we knew his plant was producing low-enriched uranium fuel pellets. Over time I pressed him. And then, this is something that I play over in my head, like a video, I remember it as if it was yesterday. Slava came one afternoon to the US embassy in the old capital of Almaty. It's since moved up north to Astana . He said, \u201cAndy, somebody wants to meet you,\u201d and I said okay, sure. We left the embassy, hopped in his Soviet vintage military Jeep, and he drove me to the outskirts of town, to a small company called Bars , which means snow leopard. They were selling night vision goggles, basically military equipment, to sportsmen and hunters. I went up into this apartment building where they had their office, and met Colonel Korbator, who was a former KGB border guard. We were all talking, a bunch of guys, and then he said, \u201cAndy, let's take a walk.\u201d It was snowing that day. We went out into the courtyard and he said, \u201cAndy, I have a message for you from Vitaly Mette,\u201d the factory director. We were walking, and he discreetly passed me a very small piece of paper, folded in half. I took it out of his hand and I kept walking, and I looked at it, and I gulped, and put it back in my pocket. It said \u201c600 kg, U-235, 90%.\u201d That's weapons-grade, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and 600 kilograms is enough for perhaps several dozen nuclear weapons. I was just absolutely shocked because our intelligence didn't indicate that there was any HEU at this factory. There was a lot of skepticism when I reported that back to Washington. Right off the bat, I did. And honestly, I took a risk in believing it, but it was because I trusted Vitaly. By then, I got to size him up, know him pretty well, and he seemed like a straight shooter. So I reported that back to Washington and this led to an effort on my part, with guidance from Washington, to try to move this from what had the feel of a black market deal into a secret government-to-government channel. I was able to do that over time. President Clinton invited President Nazarbayev to visit Washington, and we had a private meeting in President Nazarbayev's bedroom where he was staying in Blair House . Well, I was a young man then, 33 years old. I worked for an extraordinarily talented ambassador, William Courtney. We were in constant communication about this, and he was very supportive. I was lucky in that respect. Together, frankly, we went out on a limb with this whole concept of even considering that the US government would purchase this material, because this is something we had never done. It seemed like the right approach to us, but it took Washington a while to make that decision. In fact, there was a lot of opposition to bringing foreign origin enriched uranium into the United States. Mostly from the Department of Energy and the Secretary of Energy, on the grounds that it was a risk or a bad precedent. There were a lot of reasons. The main argument was that we would somehow create a market for this type of material. Yeah, but my feeling was: boy, if there are people selling this, we want them to come to the United States government first. One of our requests to their president was to arrange for me and a technical expert to visit this facility and verify that highly enriched uranium was there. He turned to a general who was Chairman of the KNB and said, \u201cMake this happen.\u201d So in March of 1994, Washington sent out a technical expert named Elwood Gift from Oak Ridge National Laboratory . Elwood Gift at the Ulba plant Would you have been able to access the site without a formal channel to the Kazakh government? Well, on my hunting trip, Mette had arranged for his staff to give me a windshield tour of the plant, before my flight back to Almaty. But I couldn\u2019t really learn anything by just looking at buildings. I think it would've been very, very hard to verify the quantity and quality of the uranium without cooperating with the government. This was probably one of the biggest secrets that the government of Kazakhstan had. It's only in the movies that somebody would break into a facility and take samples. That just doesn't happen. But we still did it secretly, because that's how they wanted to do it, and because we felt that the best security of this at-risk material was the fact that very few people knew it was there. Elwood and I were escorted up to Ust'-Kamenogorsk by a Lieutenant Colonel from the KNB who flew with us in an Antonov An-12, which is a small turboprop. We had dinner with Vitaly and his team. We spent the whole next day going through the factory, and he showed us the warehouse-like area where the HEU was. It was protected by a good padlock, is what we reported back to Washington. It was like one of those Civil War, antique shop-era padlocks. There was one female guard, armed with a Makarov pistol. Vitaly Mette had the key brought, unlocked the padlock, and we entered this large room with a platform on the floor. It was a plywood on cinder blocks kind of situation. There were different sizes and shapes of stainless steel buckets, intentionally spread out for criticality safety, on this platform. [ The uranium had been prepared for a secret submarine fuel project, which had been canceled in the 1980s. The highly enriched uranium was left behind. ] We randomly took samples from different buckets. We'd say, \u201cWe want to open that one,\u201d and they were very cooperative. We were able to take some samples and send them back to Washington. We also did assays on-site, and were able to verify the quantity of material and the enrichment level. Further analysis was done when the samples were shipped back to laboratories in the United States. Weber at Ust\u2019-Kamenogorsk during the March visit A worker opens a cannister holding uranium rods at the Ulba plant What did the interactions between you and the ambassador and DOE look like? It's mostly restricted cable traffic back and forth with the State Department, Defense Department, CIA and Department of Energy. There were NSC meetings held on this once that verification went back to Washington. The ambassador's cable said, \u201c...and it's protected by a good padlock.\u201d That set off alarms in Washington in early March. It took many, many months before we actually had a team come to Kazakhstan to package the material and secretly ship it back to the United States. They arrived in October, and then left right before Thanksgiving in November. [ Details of the packing process have been documented in the Sydney Morning Herald : \u201cEach day, they left their hotel before dawn and returned after dark, spending 12 hours packing the uranium into special containers suitable for flying. There were seven types of uranium-bearing materials in the warehouse, much of it laced with toxic beryllium. Altogether, the team discovered 1032 containers in the warehouse. Each had to be unpacked, examined and repacked into milk carton-sized cans that were inserted into 448 shipping containers \u2013 55-gallon drums with foam inserts \u2013 for the flight.\u201d ] Weber at the Ulba plant, fall 1994 Where did the uranium end up? We packaged it in Department of Transportation approved containers for transporting fissile material and flew it back on a C-5 Galaxy, the military cargo aircraft. That was, at the time, the longest C-5 flight ever. It was flown back with three, perhaps four aerial refuelings en route. The planes didn't land in Europe, they just went all the way straight back to the United States over water, and they landed at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. They were met by a secure ground transport convoy and the material was taken to Oak Ridge, Tennessee to the Y-12 plant , and there it was secured. loading the uranium, in drums, into the C-5 Galaxy The Galaxy on the tarmac in Kazakhstan Once it was behind the fence, there were press conferences in Almaty and at the Pentagon in Washington, announcing the successful partnership between our governments. And the material was eventually blended down to low enriched uranium and used for the nuclear power industry. Yeah, I don't know how cheap, but sure. There was a catchphrase for the bigger HEU purchase agreement, Megatons to Megawatts . The official seal created for Project Sapphire What would've happened to your career if it was a false alarm? I mean, I could've recovered, but it certainly would've caused reputational damage. But I thought this was probably the most important issue in Kazakhstan at the time. They had inherited, on their territory, well over a thousand nuclear warheads. Those were still on military bases under Russian control. The world's biggest biological weapons factory was located in Kazakhstan, and they were actually at a reactor site on the Caspian Sea. There were, we learned later, three tons of plutonium in spent fuel from a fast breeder reactor. That led to a multi-year project to securely package that material and move it by rail across the country to a site in Semipalatinsk , Kazakhstan for more secure dry storage. Well, individuals matter. History doesn't just happen. I've been held up as the example for this project, but there was a massive team involved. Everything you do in government, perhaps unlike academia, is a team sport. One piece of advice I could give to young people starting out in government service is: don't sit at your desk and have lunch. Spend time getting to know the people that you have to work with. You get stuff done by having that network. My whole career really was about networking, whether it was in my overseas interactions or back in Washington inside the Pentagon. A bar of highly enriched uranium at the Ulba plant You've been at State and DOD, two very different institutions. What have the pain points been? The pain points for me have always been my sense of urgency vs. the bureaucratic pace. Things are complicated, and it always takes longer than you'd expect. I learned about the 600 kilograms of highly enriched uranium in December, and it wasn't until the following October that the team and packaging materials arrived in Kazakhstan. Can you imagine? The slowness was very frustrating. It was a big complicated operation that required training and a lot of specialized preparation. But, when there was focus and high level leadership \u2013 in this case Bill Perry was Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter was Assistant Secretary of Defense and Jeff Starr was a senior advisor to them who worked on this full-time \u2013 they really drove Washington to make this happen. Sometimes it takes that high-level push to really unblock the bureaucracy. It's process, it's decision making, it's overthinking things. Countless NSC meetings on so many topics. The project to remove and destroy serious chemical weapons is a good example of that. I had a reputation for not letting go of issues that I care about. I get very passionate and almost obsessed and, I don't know if that's always good, but it certainly is in entrepreneurial policy making. In fact, I love that word, entrepreneurial. I remember we were with colleagues from the National Security Council staff and from the State Department, briefing on a program that had successfully interdicted Iran's attempts to gain access to pathogens, technologies, and the expertise of scientists at a bioweapons institute in Siberia called the Vector Research Center for Virology . It's one of the two places in the world that has a WHO-authorized repository of smallpox virus. The other one is CDC in Atlanta. We learned about it from very sensitive signals intelligence. The normal thing at the time, in a situation like that, would be to dumb down the intelligence and d\u00e9marche [ formally solicit ] the government of Russia and ask them to do something about it. We\u2019d call them d\u00e9marchemallows. But that's not good, because you risk compromising intelligence. At that time, Moscow was a very weak government, not in control of things around the country. So we went to the source of the problem; not to some Ministry of Foreign Affairs office in Moscow. Instead we went out to Siberia to negotiate with the director, a guy named Lev Sandakhchiev . He cared mostly about being able to pay the people"

At Statecraft , we\u2019re nerds for the procedural, the nitty-gritty. We won\u2019t be lobbing softballs. Instead, we\u2019ll push interviewees to explain exactly how the sausage gets made: How do successful government initiatives happen? Who did you have to win over to make them happen? And, just as importantly: What did you learn from failing? What would you have done differently? We think these interviews can serve as roadmaps for readers trying to get big hairy things done in the public sector, and illuminate the inner workings of government for the policy-curious. We also think they\u2019re tremendous stories. We\u2019ll be publishing a new interview every two weeks, and will be operating with support from the Institute for Progress and the Policy Entrepreneurs Network.

There\u2019s a shared sense that this ability has atrophied. The specific cases invoked vary, but they include the CDC\u2019s slow response to COVID-19, housing shortages, multi-year backlogs for entry visas, the Obamacare website rollout, California\u2019s failure to build high speed rail, and so on. Liberals and conservatives disagree about the macro-level solutions to our lack of state capacity. Do we need more funding? Fewer regulations? We\u2019ll interview folks of all ideological stripes, but we won\u2019t be adjudicating those high-level debates. Instead, we\u2019re after concrete lessons at the micro-level. In our view, these interviewees have lessons about getting stuff done that can help inform anyone trying to achieve results in the public sector. To build state capacity, we need to understand what that means to practitioners in their day-to-day. The folks we\u2019re interviewing are policy entrepreneurs: people who have worked on policy areas for a while and have built up implicit knowledge over time. They have the procedural and organizational chops to get stuff done in large, kludgy bureaucracies. Often, their knowledge is contextual and hard to explain. How do I convince my agency to act? How do I work around the dreaded Paperwork Reduction Act? How do I establish a partnership with the private sector? Our goal with Statecraft is to make this insider knowledge explicit and public \u2014 demystifying how governance really works. We expect there to be some similarities across interviews, like best practices for coalition-building, or who not to piss off. But government agencies are heterogeneous, and trying to improve USCIS looks different than trying to improve the DOE. Building state capacity isn\u2019t about turning one dial in a particular direction: Each case study will tell us something novel. We\u2019d love suggestions from readers about who we should interview, and what you\u2019d like to hear them explain. If you have an idea, email santi@ifp.org . We\u2019re looking for interviewees who do some of the below: Prioritized important but neglected problems.

An Inaugural Regress Studies Symposium Santi Ruiz Aug 23, 2023 20 5 8 Share What have we lost to the past? Limiting ourselves to the material and technological, here\u2019s a non-exhaustive list. There are cities and civilizations reclaimed by the jungle: the Mesoamerican Toltecs, Khmer cities and their hydraulic marvels across Cambodia, great Amazonian societies. The Mississippians with their great mounds, Carthage, razed and salted. Pre-Mongol Baghdad, the greatest city in the world. The mysterious peoples of Gran Patajen , the Tiwanacu, and the Nazca line drawers. We\u2019ve lost vast libraries of human knowledge, like Alexandria, of course, but also more recent cases: thousands of texts during the English dissolution of the monasteries, Leuven in 1914, the great Polish Krasinski and Zaluski troves in 1944. We know many of the texts we\u2019ve lost: Aristotle\u2019s dialogues, Pindar and Sappho\u2019s poetry, Pliny\u2019s Naturalis Historia, works of Sulla, Cicero, Caesar, the vast majority of Maya and Aztec literature, Incan quipus, an epistle to Corinth, the Yongle Encyclopedia, Shakespeare\u2019s Cardenio. Two of Bach\u2019s Passions , George and Martha Washington\u2019s letters, Carlyle\u2019s first draft of The French Revolution , all of Hemingway\u2019s work pre-1922, Walter Benjamin\u2019s final manuscript. And there are others we\u2019ve lost which we can\u2019t know, of course: countless oral traditions, for instance, including works of Homer. Losses of the natural world come readily to mind for Americans: bison on the Great Plains, or beavers great and small, or the passenger pigeon, the mammoth, or perhaps the dodo bird. In 1497, John Cabot's crew reported that the Newfoundland sea \"is full of fish that can be taken not only with nets but with fishing baskets.\" Oysters were the size of dinner plates in the Chesapeake Bay, said the first European explorers. Salmon in the Pacific Northwest was so plentiful that even during the Great Depression it sold for the contemporary equivalent of a dollar per pound: poor man\u2019s food. Then there are losses of craft, of techne , and of ability: Dhaka muslin , or bardic chant, or poetic navigation. Greek fire, whatever the antikythera mechanism slotted into. Oppenheimer believed ancient Indian civilizations had already come upon atomic power and more besides. And there are more esoteric claims of loss, if you\u2019re interested: Atlantean geoengineering , alchemical knowledge, Lemurian stone cutting, the Giza power plant . The Book of Thoth, which contains secrets to comprehend the speech of animals. Does it Matter? Here\u2019s a question: does it all matter? That we lost all those things, the troves of human knowledge, the jungle-devoured cultures, the technological advances, the keys to understanding the ancient Hittite jokes? Really, who cares? I had this argument with a friend last fall. He suggested (I paraphrase) that the great texts that were lost can\u2019t in fact have been a great loss, because human reason is such that, if we didn\u2019t have Aristotle, someone else would have invented him. Moreover, by definition and by Providence we weren\u2019t meant to have those lost texts, because they\u2019re lost. Share I asked four friends, each of whom works with the past in some way, to weigh in on this question: why care? They contributed mini-essays below. Brief introductions: Wendi Yan is a new media artist and historian of science, whose Tiny Museum of Mammoth Technologies is one of the most striking physical art installations I\u2019ve experienced. In addition to being the managing editor of The Washington Review of Books , Chris McCaffery reads more than anyone I know. Ruby Thelot is a designer and classicist whose essays on virtual realms, digital communities, and artificial intelligence have deeply shaped my thinking. And I have shared an essay by Isaac Wilks on this newsletter before: he\u2019s an incisive critic and polymath. For Wendi: I\u2019d be curious for your thoughts about this question in the context of geological time . What have we lost that we\u2019re not even aware of? Have we lost parts of the past that we could never have known about? What does it do for us to become aware of the grand sweep of history that we missed out on? Up until the late 18th century, the Western world still considered the Earth\u2019s history to be just thousands of years older than humans\u2019 own history, if not specifically dating back to 4004 BC. Through the \u201ctime revolution\u201d of the 19th century, the West discovered what later came to be known as \u201cdeep time.\u201d It vastly enlarged humans\u2019 perception of the timescale of the universe, which, just like what Copernicus did with the spatial scale, revealed humanity\u2019s smallness against the Earth. Yet today, we still don\u2019t know how the origins of human civilization looked like, and how that intersected with the Earth\u2019s own evolution. We significantly underestimate how far humans and megafauna like mammoths traveled in \u201cprehistoric times.\u201d We have crude speculations about how humans organized themselves socially in paleolithic times. We don\u2019t really know how humans were doing in the Ice Age. As Marcia Bjornerud argued in Timefulness , most of us humans are temporally illiterate, utterly unaware of the scale of the Earth\u2019s history before our appearance, and too shortsighted to see its importance in guiding our environmental actions. When \u201cancient\u201d means Rome in 0 AD, when popular media falsely portrays 10th century Vikings as barbarians, how is it possible for us to make reliable sense of the humans that sculpted the bronze \u201calien\u201d heads of Sanxingdui in 2000 BC and built Stonehenge in 4000 BC? Perhaps it is the necessity of modernity to hold relentless prejudice against prehistoric humans. I find it rewarding, following Claude Le\u0301vi-Strauss, to frame mythological thought as \u201cneolithic science.\u201d We could see progress through a more expansive lens when we examine what was happening in \u201cprehistory,\u201d a concept that is itself encoded with bias toward a particular frame of science. A most curious\u2014and haunting\u2014case for me is the mammoth huts discovered in today\u2019s Ukraine and Russia. Dated to 25,000 years ago, these huts comprise bones of at least 60 mammoths, at around 40-foot diameter. Historian of Science Claudine Cohen called it belonging to \u201ca mammoth civilization,\u201d which not only ate mammoths, built such mammoth structures, but also wore mammoth hide and wore sculpted pieces from mammoth tusks. These huts could be for daily living, or ritual purposes\u2014how the Ice Age humans lived alongside mammoths, we don\u2019t really know. In recent years, some scholars have started to write histories that zoom out, spatially and temporally, from the human-centric perspective of history (e.g. Daniel L. Smail\u2019s neurohistory, or Martin J. S. Rudwick\u2019s deep history). Compared with how much we know about the American Civil War, or World War II, we know very little about the history of the Earth with humans as one embedded component. We have perhaps been writing too much human history. But we have lost, or perhaps never really gained, the perspective of humans continuously interacting with their environment, co-evolving with the Earth. Subscribe For Isaac: You might consider notes on Amazon civilizations; if they were, of what sort were they, and what might we stand to gain from encountering them? Only one group of men from the Old World ever saw the civilizations of central Amazonia in their flower. This was the expedition of the Spaniard Francisco de Orellana in 1540-1. Rumors\u2014and were they not mostly true?\u2014of La Canela , a land of cinnamon plantations, had trickled in from east of the Andes. They pulled Orellana and his forty-nine men down a river which began in the uplands of eastern Ecuador and which, to his shock, did not seem to end. In those hills they left behind a host of 220 Spaniards and 4,000 natives under the command of Gonzalo Pizarro, half-brother of the executioner of the Inca; Pizarro stumbled naked back into Quito two years later, lea"

Santi Ruiz Aug 11, 2023 2 Share The destruction of Tenochtitlan, Spanish, 16th century I wrote a book review for The American Conservative print edition in June, that\u2019s now out from behind the online paywall, on a new history of the Aztec/conquistador encounter. It\u2019s the third book review I\u2019ve gotten to write in about a year on histories of the New World, specifically histories that attempt to focus more seriously on native accounts of encounters with Europeans. I don\u2019t think this book was very good, both because it was dry as a bone and because it purported to tell the native side without actually trying to articulate the native experience. We have copious Aztec texts from the fall of Tenochtitlan, and the narrators don\u2019t portray themselves and their people as just like the Spaniards. There are real, gaping cultural differences that matter for our understanding. Taking them into account may mean upsetting both right-leaning readers unconvinced that there\u2019s something to be learned from native versions of history, and left-leaning readers who would like to impose a contemporary racial/social reading on a more complicated set of events.

Santi Ruiz Aug 11, 2023 2 Share The destruction of Tenochtitlan, Spanish, 16th century I wrote a book review for The American Conservative print edition in June, that\u2019s now out from behind the online paywall, on a new history of the Aztec/conquistador encounter. It\u2019s the third book review I\u2019ve gotten to write in about a year on histories of the New World, specifically histories that attempt to focus more seriously on native accounts of encounters with Europeans. I don\u2019t think this book was very good, both because it was dry as a bone and because it purported to tell the native side without actually trying to articulate the native experience. We have copious Aztec texts from the fall of Tenochtitlan, and the narrators don\u2019t portray themselves and their people as just like the Spaniards. There are real, gaping cultural differences that matter for our understanding. Taking them into account may mean upsetting both right-leaning readers unconvinced that there\u2019s something to be learned from native versions of history, and left-leaning readers who would like to impose a contemporary racial/social reading on a more complicated set of events. A pinched view of New World history is acceptable if you\u2019re a European, I think. But for natives of this hemisphere, buying nonsense narratives of your land\u2019s history and the histories of the people on it hurts only us. If you\u2019re an American, you owe it to yourself to have an understanding of the country that moves beyond noble savage utopianism, and manifest destiny chicanery. You may not have the same obligations about Central and South American history, but I feel some; there were men with my last name and from the same regions of Spain as my ancestors on Cort\u00e9s\u2019 conquista . Please do give TAC the clicks and consider reading the full review here . One fascinating fact I didn\u2019t know before this piece: Cortes commissioned the construction of three ships on the Pacific coast of Mexico in 1535, to continue sailing across the Pacific and locate a path to the Spice Islands. These ships were built 6,000 miles from home, with almost entirely local materials, without a dedicated port. Pretty cool. 2 Share Previous Next Discussion about this post Comments Restacks T"

So it is with Iris Murdoch, a top-tier Platonist philosopher. One work called The Sovereignty of Good , a rigorous and original defense of a \u201cmoral reality external to ourselves,\u201d is as deep and as clear as the best of C.S. Lewis. Murdoch also wrote novels: The Black Prince won the 1973 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction and was shortlisted for the Booker. It holds up. Formally a psychological thriller, unreliably narrated by an older writer in a jealous, symbiotic relationship with a younger writer (and the women in his family), The Black Prince is functionally about the relationship between love and art: whether being in love makes art better, whether it replaces the artistic instinct, and whether loves directed toward the wrong things make one\u2019s art worse. As in The Sovereignty of Good , Murdoch is interested in the hierarchies of virtues and experiences. Is it better to love truly and fully than it is to tell the truth (and is it possible to be truly in love if one is estranged from reality)? It ends with a remarkable twist, and then another (which I didn\u2019t understand on the first read-through) involving and invoking the muse. Can\u2019t recommend this one highly enough. Subscribe Nature, Toothless and Declawed Readers of this newsletter are disproportionately likely to have strong opinions, one way or the other, about \u201cshrimp welfare.\u201d For those not read in, the idea that the suffering of shrimp may be the most important moral issue of our time comes from a utilitarian view held in effective altruist circles, that measuring and minimizing pain and suffering is the most admirable thing one can do. It follows to many that shrimp, which appear to feel pain and exist in tremendous quantity, deserve our attention. It appears to follow, to some, that we should focus our resources on stopping shrimp from suffering not only in our diets but in the wild. And perhaps we should do the same for all wild animals, if such a thing becomes possible. Martha Nussbaum brings her own philosophical approach to the question of animal welfare, oriented around her framework of \u201ccapabilities,\u201d in a new book, \u201cJustice for Animals.\u201d As Clare Coffey describes in this review, Nussbaum\u2019s idea of capabilities refers to \u201cthe ability of sentient creatures to flourish in the specific form of life of their species \u2014 for the pigs to wallow and root and farrow, for the dolphins to swim long distances and play, for the ruminants to range freely in a herd, and so on. Underlying these differences are capabilities \u2014 goods \u2014 common to all: bodily integrity, health, mobility, and others.\u201d When it comes to the question, \u201cShould we try and stop all predation in the animal world?\u201d I\u2019m with Coffey against Nussbaum, who thinks the answer is yes. The essay is a genuine engagement with different ways of thinking about our obligations to the animal kingdom. And it brings up potentially the most interesting conundrum for animal welfare: what do we do about the fact that plants are far more sentient than we give them credit for? (Aristotle\u2019s vegetative soul may be due for a refresh.)

Like numismatics or philately, it\u2019s not the most useful hobby, but it satisfies two urges. For one, it\u2019s pleasant to read glowing reviews of an editor\u2019s body of work, since I am an editor. And it\u2019s also pleasant to read extremely good and tight pieces of writing. The authors must feel an absurd amount of pressure to write glistening little jewel obits. Given the topics, readers are especially primed to pay attention to sentence structure and word choice. And perhaps the deceased editors observe as well, from far above. Perhaps as a result the obituaries are tremendous works.

Gottlieb apparently woke up in the middle of one night and called Joseph Heller with a realization: his upcoming book should be \u201cCatch-22,\u201d not \u201cCatch-18.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s funnier,\u201d said Gottlieb. Another Robert, Bingham, from 1982, left one writer the same note regularly: \u201cMy patience is not inexhaustible.\u201d Miss Gould applied to the New Yorker at the age of 22 by mailing in the most recent copy, with every grammatical error and inconsistency highlighted in blue pencil (in response to which the editor-in-chief apparently bellowed \u201cFind this bitch and hire her!\u201d). Roger Angell, who died at the ripe age of one hundred and one, \u201cmay have carried on one of the longest engagements with psychotherapists in the city\u2019s history.\u201d As one might expect from New York\u2019s toniest publication, the obituaries reveal wonderful little nuggets of blueblood drama. Angell, who edited Nabokov, Updike, and Thurber, was the son of the magazine\u2019s founding fiction editor, Katharine Sargeant Angell White, who married E.B. White (he of Stuart Little and Charlotte\u2019s Web fame). She did so without mentioning it to her son, who was nine at the time: he learned about it from a newspaper column. When Angell White died, \u201cher office \u2013 a prime piece of real estate \u2013 was left vacant for several years,\u201d to \u201clet the meaning drain out\u2026 so its future inhabitants wouldn\u2019t get any big ideas about who they were.\u201d Of course that kind of sustained legacy, the son doing his mother\u2019s job in his mother\u2019s office, leads to deeply rooted editorial rules and practices, which the obituaries do their best to show off. See the comma work: \u201cBennet, who died, of cancer, earlier this month, a few weeks short of seventy-seven\u2026\u201d You can\u2019t get away with that just anywhere. One can dispute the following characterization of the New Yorker \u2019s prose in the obituary of \u201cGrammarian\u201d Miss Gould (the title was invented for her): \u201ca kind of Euclidean clarity\u2014transparent, precise, muscular.\u201d Personally I find the endless accent aigus effeminate rather than beefy. But it\u2019s undoubtedly a style, and any style maintained long enough is worthy of at least some admiration. I will leave you with the obituary of Robert Bingham, in the hope that you will appreciate it, since it is from 1982 and was rather hard to find. And I may start, as Miss Gould did, to inscribe \u201cHave we completely lost our mind?\u201d in the margins of pieces I edit. Share Thanks for reading Regress Studies!

Santi Ruiz Jul 10, 2023 8 Share New England Editor, Thomas Hart Benton, 1946 Something I\u2019ve taken to collecting recently: obituaries of New Yorker editors. Like numismatics or philately, it\u2019s not the most useful hobby, but it satisfies two urges. For one, it\u2019s pleasant to read glowing reviews of an editor\u2019s body of work, since I am an editor. And it\u2019s also pleasant to read extremely good and tight pieces of writing. The authors must feel an absurd amount of pressure to write glistening little jewel obits. Given the topics, readers are especially primed to pay attention to sentence structure and word choice. And perhaps the deceased editors observe as well, from far above. Perhaps as a result the obituaries are tremendous works.

    "keywords": "A Guest Post on metricizing your health  Technical Nemesis A Guest Post on metricizing your health Santi Ruiz Jun 30, 2023 2 Share The Birth of the Virgin, Jan de Beer, circa 1520 On June 26th, the fitness tracker company Oura announced an integration with Slack, allowing users of the tracker to link their Oura Readiness and Sleep Scores for their colleagues to see. The integration is billed as a tool to help remote team members \u201ccommunicate with empathy,\u201d by signaling when your colleague may be tired or stressed. But it can also be read as a metricization of health that alienates users from their bodies, rather than further integrating the mind and body. Here at Regress Studies we\u2019re excited to publish our first guest essay, from Paige Brann , on what the modern transformation of medicine does to our feelings of embodiment. I purchased an Oura Ring for Nicole a few months ago, so Paige and I disagree somewhat on how to engage with the biotech metricization complex. But it\u2019s a sharp, provocative essay worth chewing on. Going forward, Regress Studies will publish occasional guest essays like this one. If you\u2019re interested in contributing, please reach out via email. We\u2019re interested in essays that treat the past seriously, and essays about things which persevere. Subscribe We use the words that are presently available to us in our culture to signify basic human realities. In a technological age, the words available to us are technological: \u201clet me double click on that,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m wired that way,\u201d \u201che scanned the room,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m monitoring it.\u201d But the words we use also have the power to shape our understandings of the things we mean by them. This process is not a new one. Methodist preacher John Wesley complained about the use of the word reproduction to mean sexual generation: \u201cBuffon substitutes for the plain word Generation , a quaint word of his own, Reproduction , in order to level man not only with the beasts that perish, but with nettles and onions.\u201d Nettles and onions reproduce, but generation is sexual. For Wesley, this was a theological and political issue. Kinship with God, who generates, elevates man above other biological organisms, and using a desexed term like \u201creproduction\u201d would level out all creatures. Now, I\u2019m a vegan, so I depart from Wesley in thinking that humans are far closer to God than any other living thing. But I\u2019m struck by the small but real sense of loss he conveys: that the move from the language of the human to the language of the machine process, or the vegetative, abstracts us from our bodies. The term \u201creproduction\u201d in the eighteenth century entered the broader lexicon as a product of changes in the organization of work as well as science. As work shifted toward mechanized and standardized procedures, the language of reproducing emerged. Changes in science mirrored those in work: birth had been left to midwives and non-professionals in a community, only unprofessional in the sense that they were untrained and uncertified, but reproduction became a scientific, professional matter that could be explained and broken down into trimesters and medical terms. This is what Jacques Ellul calls technique: the essence of technique is to compel the qualitative to become quantitative. 1 Technique is essential to the process of medicalizing behaviors and experiences, since redefining a human condition as a medical condition makes it something that can be concretely described, diagnosed, and treated. Ancient visions of health ranged from the humors of Greece to the elements in Ayurveda, but they all treated health as a virtue, because it required harmony with a particular community and environment. Health science has allowed us all to replace vague complaints of malaise with a clear checklist of symptoms, potential sites of infection, and tests that run the gamut to find out precisely what the problem is. But as more complete technical knowledge of man is developed, promising efficiency and control over our body, the reality of this technique is turning our bodies over to a certified professional for maintenance. Relying on scientific metrics of health encourages us to divide ourselves into discrete fragments, we see different specialists for each problem, and erodes our ability to be conscious of our own \u201cliving presence.\u201d Embodied and sensorial knowledge is at odds with mechanical, technical development since it is much harder to sort qualitative experience into precise categories. This is most apparent in the current growth of biotechnology. The transformation in medicine that defines our current era is one where health is an individual responsibility, and in which health is increasingly understood quantitatively. The Oura Ring, a wearable gaining traction in the women\u2019s health market, describes its mission as nothing less than to improve the way we live our lives. Nowadays, health care is sick care. People are feeling worse, not better. Ultimately, we want everyone to realize health as a daily practice. We are creating a future where people have the understanding and tools to practice their health through continuous access to accurate information and personalized guidance wrapped around their finger. That's why we exist: to empower every person to own their inner potential. The ring gives you daily scores based on the measurements of things like basal body temperature, sleep quality, and heart rate, and informs you whether today is a day to push yourself or take it easy. Despite its use of phrases like \u201ctune in\u201d or \u201cinner potential,\u201d Oura\u2019s app is designed so that those inner processes become external. Rather than returning health to something unprofessional and qualitative, the Oura Ring has made all aspects of an individual body\u2019s health quantifiable \u2013 and scorable \u2013 so that you actually don\u2019t need anyone but the numbers to truly unlock your \u201cinner potential.\u201d Share The Ring is just one of a bevy of wearables designed to translate the internal, qualitative experience of the body into data which is external and metricized. At Apple\u2019s WWDC 23 keynote, VP of Health Dr. Sumbul Desai announced new features to track physical and mental health on the Apple Watch and Health app. She wrote in her announcement that the goal is to empower people to take charge of their own health. This vision of people taking responsibility for their own health is one Dr. Desai has been promoting , believing that \u201cif [users] take action using science-based data and insights\u2026 there\u2019s nothing more powerful. Because you\u2019re tapping yourself as a motivator.\u201d Once users generate enough data about their biological processes, the Apple Watch can identify problems before users even see a doctor. New features promoted at WWDC 23 included adding mental health data to the Health and Mindfulness app that will allow users to log emotions and moods daily across devices. Scrolling through amoebic shapes in soothing pastel colors, users can choose a shape that represents their mental state on a scale of \u201cVery Unpleasant\u201d to \u201cVery Pleasant\u201d and log what might be causing those feelings to give insights into their mood. As users log their moods and listen to music, Apple will identify what daily habits are affecting the user\u2019s state of mind. Funky shapes come to symbolize certain moods, and Apple is positioned as a therapist capable of providing insights. These models and numbers seem at first like a tool to understand the body, but tools are like sacraments: what they symbolize is inevitably what they do . Wearables symbolize the return of health to laypeople, in a manner that suggests you really can be in charge of your own health. Rather than dismantle the doctor/patient dyad that exists in professionalized healthcare, the devices make an individual a permanent patient. In a 1990 speech, social critic and priest Ivan Illich predicted the effects of an increasing technicization of health: It would be politically naive, after health and responsibility have been made technically impossible, to somehow resurrect them t"

    "keywords": "Western historians must interpret Aztec culture on its own terms. Western historians must interpret Aztec culture on its own terms. Western historians must interpret Aztec culture on its own terms. Conquistadors and Aztecs: A History of the Fall of Tenochtitlan , by Stefan Rinke, Oxford University Press, 328 pages. Contemporary historiography aims above all to treat native peoples seriously, in particular to recognize them as potent political actors in their own right. This approach has obvious benefits, but it also has its flaws. At times this historiography has a tendency to treat all its subjects as functionally equivalent, wearing various cultural skins but remaining liberal individuals underneath. Anthropologist Marshall Sahlins argued persuasively in How Natives Think that to understand native Hawaiians, we must take seriously the idea that they actually believed Captain James Cook was a god. In 1996, the book felt like a decisive blow against critics like Gananath Obeyesekere, who claimed that to take Cook-worship at face value was a kind of Western chauvinism, a mocking of savages. Conquistadors and Aztecs: A History of the Fall of Tenochtitlan , a new history of Cortes\u2019s conquest by Stefan Rinke, ably describes the basic beats of the encounter but fails to bring to life the fundamental otherness of Aztec culture. The book\u2019s publication comes on the 500th anniversary of the fall of Tenochtitlan, the Mexica (as Rinke refers to the Aztecs) capital. The author sets out his historiographical goal in the introduction: \u201cto question the manner in which contemporary witnesses and later historians constructed and represented their subjects.\u201d But although he fairly describes them, Rinke can\u2019t quite make them legible in full color. Conquistadors and Aztecs is at its strongest in its presentation of Hernan Cortes. While Golden Age poets glorified Cortes as a new Mars, he was in many ways vicious, murdering fellow Spaniards while still in Cuba, and venal (likely syphilitic). The popular narrative accurately captures his almost unfathomable greed, which seemed to surpass that of his contemporaries. The reader cringes when Cortes repeatedly insists to natives that his men \u201csuffered a disease of the heart that could only be satisfied with gold.\u201d But he and his men were also genuinely motivated to end the barbarism of human sacrifice and cannibalism. In one tense political negotiation, Cortes killed a man who had offered him a bowl of human blood. All sources highlight his intensity and his power to win men over. The men he led came from a social class of petty nobility, all between twenty and forty years old, pushed into the new world when their ambitions in the Old were stymied. Many of his men sold all their possessions to outfit themselves for the conquest. Drawn mostly from Andalusia, they inherited a cultural memory of the Reconquista , and styled themselves after the heroes of Troy and the Punic Wars. Perhaps the social precarity of Cortes and his men explains their best quality: a bias to action, an alea iacta est instinct which time and again served them well in the New World. Cortes keenly understood that in an era of distended communication and fragmented political authority, almost any insubordination could be swept under the rug or rewritten later. But he took pains to publicly follow the letter of the law. The Aztecs mocked Cortes\u2019s \u201cwomanliness\u201d for his insistence on reading out royal proclamations before acting. Rinke struggles to explain the motivations for Mesoamerican human sacrifice, and he doesn\u2019t articulate the fundamental rift the practice caused between Aztecs and Spaniards. According to John Keegan\u2019s History of Warfare , \u201cthere is a cruelty in the warfare of some pre-Columbian peoples of North and Central America that has no parallel elsewhere in the world.\u201d When the Aztecs are compared to other ancient empires, it is the centrality and regularity of ritual torture and killing that stands as unique. At a temple in Tlaxcala, one valley away from Tenochtitlan, a conquistador counted one hundred thousand skulls. Twenty-thousand were slaughtered at the inauguration of one new temple. That some, perhaps many, victims were complicit partners in their own days-long murders makes the Aztecs that much harder to understand. Inga Clendinnen, an authority on the Aztecs from an era of less circumspect historiography, argued that the practice can only be understood as self-justification by the Aztecs. To make this number of sacrifices, constantly, to the ravenous gods proved their devotion and therefore their moral standing. Rinke elides this insight, preferring language like \u201cpolitical purposes\u201d or \u201cdemonstrations of political power.\u201d Of course Tenochtitlan was the center of an incredibly powerful political order, larger than every European city bar Constantinople. But its success held the seeds of its downfall. An empire that had reached its apex through killing had spent several generations training itself to fight only to wound and capture, the better to harvest sacrifices with. The conquistadors were saved from slaughter largely because Aztec warriors competed to capture rather than kill them. It is hard for any Western history to capture a culture this foreign, worshiping gods who, in Keegan\u2019s words, demanded constant sacrifices \u201cof everything and anything of value, even of the most trivial value, but above all of human life itself.\u201d But if it can\u2019t capture how its subjects perceived the world, even the most accurate history will remain incomplete.

    "keywords": "What we mean by \"bearing witness.\"  Are you supposed to watch videos of people getting killed? A couple days ago, Unherd writer Aris Roussinos made a strong argument for the no camp, and I think I agree. Which is a little funny, because if you\u2019d looked at his and my work five years ago, you might have thought we both wanted you to see more videos of dying people. I\u2019m being slightly too flippant, so let me back up: Roussinos is a former foreign correspondent for Vice TV, from back before Vice focused on Bushwick marginalia. He produced lots of excellent warzone reporting (and continues to write great essays). I spent a summer working for Airwars , a London organization tracking civilian casualties from airstrikes in Iraq and Syria during the fight against ISIS. The following year I wrote a thesis on the gap between our casualty numbers and the official numbers produced by the Department of Defense: it was Airwars\u2019 contention that the DoD was fudging its numbers on purpose, and I agreed. I thought it was profoundly important that we \u201cbear witness\u201d to what was happening in Syria and Iraq, by counting and naming dead civilians. And we did this by looking at photo and video evidence that those civilians were dead. As I saw it years ago, there were people like me and my colleagues, who looked, and the American populace, which didn\u2019t look. Now Americans follow the war in Ukraine closely, and a small but real contingent of people watch individual people get killed in high definition, and clip compilations of those videos for YouTube. If they\u2019d watched the equivalent videos for the war in Syria, would that have been better? When I was frustrated that friends back home didn\u2019t know what was happening in Idlib, what was I actually frustrated about? Here\u2019s Roussinos, explaining the battlefield content machine in Ukraine: ...By one grim milestone, the conflict surely surpasses any war in history: it must hold the record for the greatest number of individual human deaths captured on camera. Through the ubiquity on both sides of cheap consumer drones, used for battlefield reconnaissance and target acquisition, the trenches of eastern Ukraine are surveilled to a hitherto unimaginable extent. And by rigging the drones to drop grenades with pinpoint accuracy \u2014 a tactic initially pioneered by ISIS in the conflicts in Syria and Iraq \u2014 both sides can hunt down, chase and kill individual soldiers with the ease of a video game, sharing the HD video footage for their rival supporters. That HD video creation gets supercharged by social media: ...To follow the Ukraine war on a platform like Twitter means your feed is interspersed with the lovingly zoomed-in deaths, shared with crass jokes by Western enthusiasts, of human beings, perhaps unwilling conscripts. Niche online communities like Reddit\u2019s DronedOrc share videos with names such as \u201cDrone drops grenades on orc without pants,\u201d or, \u201cGrenade dropped on orc makes its helmet pop,\u201d for the enjoyment of its subscribers. Scrolling Twitter brings up posts such as \u201c18+ The drone operator drove the orc to suicide,\u201d in which a lone Russian soldier, cornered by a drone, shoots himself. \u201cLast seconds of an orc\u2019s life after catching a grenade from the drone in his rat hole,\u201d gloats another. To fully erode the distinction between themselves and the drone, distant internet consumers of the Ukraine war can even donate 3D-printed fins for their grenades via Twitter, inscribed with their own message, like \u201cHope this hurts XO.\u201d Roussinos goes on to articulate all the ways our existing relationship with social media makes the snuff video pipeline impossible to stop. Social media primes us to look for enemies (and creates them for us). It doesn\u2019t distinguish between the things you love and the things you love to hate-watch. And by feeding us more of what we ate in the last meal, it retrains our desires toward more viral, more common-denominator material: things which satisfy the most base impulses. When we consume war as content, it often makes us worse. But it\u2019s striking that Roussinos used to be in the business of showing an American audience the brutal realities of war. In another essay, he explained a key motivation for Vice\u2019s war correspondents: As is the nature of the trade, it was always a source of pride, and of glittering awards, to obtain better combat footage than anyone else: always getting closer to the action, dancing at the edge of death like a gladiator in the amphitheatre for the audience\u2019s thrill and delectation. The highest word of praise from an exec was \u201cgnarly.\u201d To be clear, war correspondents are good and necessary. Roussinos covered stories that needed to be covered, and I\u2019m a consumer of all kinds of grainy Twitter footage of African coups, pitched Indo-Chinese brawls in the Himalayas, and the Ukraine war (though not the snuff videos). I like following this stuff immensely. And it seems like there\u2019s an obvious distinction to make between witnessing war, which sometimes includes confronting death directly, and searching out those deaths for personal satisfaction. The former comes from a fundamental, human, visual curiosity; the latter is closer to titillation. A Marine friend refers to it as \u201cPredator porn,\u201d after the drone. Like the Aztec festival of the flayed man, the videos are a kind of ritual sacrifice, a \u201c carnival of violence .\u201d It doesn\u2019t help that the Ukraine war has clearer good and bad guys for American viewers. The consumer can take in professionally produced slaughter content, safe in his own home, and feel justified doing it. All the same, my time at Airwars wasn\u2019t entirely motivated by pure curiosity, or sober witness. At times I felt the emotional, NGO-world cousin of this consumer enjoyment. It was a source of pride to watch all the gory footage of civilian casualties in my effort to bear witness. It felt like an unheralded sacrifice, or a service done in the dark. It may be that this feeling wasn\u2019t wrong, but that the line between it and enjoying the snuff videos is thin. Maybe I was wrong to think we\u2019d prosecute the war against ISIS better if more Americans were paying visual attention. Maybe any mass consumption of this stuff would always tend toward the lowest common denominator, the most pornographic and desensitizing version. Roussinos points out you can see the Syrian war as a macabre dress rehearsal for the Ukraine war: most of the same players, all the new toys (like drones that micro-target individual fighters). But whereas the Ukraine war is eagerly observed by Americans, journalists and NGO types covering Syria largely felt they were bearing witness to something that the world didn\u2019t want to see. Reporters resigned themselves to opinion polls showing Americans don\u2019t care about foreign policy and aren\u2019t interested in the fate of Manbij (home to the best yogurt in the world, my Syrian coworker said) or Deir ez-Zor.

He produced lots of excellent warzone reporting (and continues to write great essays). I spent a summer working for Airwars , a London organization tracking civilian casualties from airstrikes in Iraq and Syria during the fight against ISIS. The following year I wrote a thesis on the gap between our casualty numbers and the official numbers produced by the Department of Defense: it was Airwars\u2019 contention that the DoD was fudging its numbers on purpose, and I agreed.

The TLDR is that we all have a tremendous facility with language, which we exercise every day, and that many of our struggles with writing occur because we don\u2019t leverage that facility. We treat writing as a field we\u2019re completely unfamiliar with, even though we unconsciously communicate with great clarity every time we speak to each other. And we can use speech to overcome all kinds of complications and difficulties in writing. Features of writing and speaking There are, of course, real differences between speaking and writing. Speaking operates in the medium of time, but (mostly) not in space. That said, speaking is bounded by space in interesting ways. Many of our new tools for online orality feel weird because of the lack of this boundary. We\u2019re used to a kind of spatial interaction, and a knowledge of who is being spoken to in a given space, that we don\u2019t get over Twitter Spaces or Clubhouse. (Some researcher friends are very interested in these dynamics.) Writing operates across time (it persists) and in physical space (on the page and in distance between writer and reader). Some cultural historians describe the advent of written language as a kind of inducement to schizophrenia: suddenly, someone can talk to you when no one is there. Although everything that can be spoken can be written, and vice versa, speech and writing are different linguistic products, with modal differences. In particular, we use a broader range of words in writing. Sentences tend to be longer and more structurally complex. Writing tends to be more explicit, in that it has complete idea units. It relies less on shared situation or background knowledge, is less personally involved than speech, and is characterized by more new information than speech. Says Elbow, \u201cWriting is spatial and visual, and this helps it do things that are hard or impossible in audible temporal speech.\u201d For instance, writing helps people step outside of their language and see it as an external object. Additionally, \u201ceven though writing puts language into external visible space, it also turns out to be a medium that enhances privacy.\u201d Writing can conserve speech and therefore tends to function as a conservative force, according to Elbow, although this seems contestable: oral cultures too are by definition cultures that conserve speech. Help me out here. Subscribe The affordances of writing Writing doesn\u2019t just help us to create complex meanings. As a physical medium and process, it actively encourages us to. We feel this pressure of absent readers who don\u2019t share our context. \u201cWhen we have to spell out what we leave implied in conversation, we have to work out our thinking more clearly. Our words might have seemed clear and convincing to live listeners, but the process of writing out our thoughts often shows us a big hole or contradiction that we didn\u2019t notice in speaking.\u201d \u201cJust as writing gives writers time to create complex meanings in language, it also gives readers time to take as long as they need to re-read and work out and ponder complex meanings. Indeed, writing helps readers surpass writers in the complexity game. While speech is valuable for its \u201cvocality\u201d (the ability to carry meaning with intonation), writing is valuable for its polyvocality . Readers can interpret multiple meanings or voices of a text. \u201cSee for example the sentence \u2018I didn\u2019t think he stole the money,\u2019 which can be spoken with multiple different intonations or emphases, but only one at a time. The same sentence, written, can carry all those emphases at once, and a reader can interpret or read into it. Here\u2019s the Encyclopedia Britannica, articulating the benefits of writing incredibly clearly: Writing allows exactly repeatable statements to be circulated widely and preserved. It allows readers to scan a text back and forth and to study, compare, and interpret at their leisure. It allows writers to deliberate over word choice and to construct lists, tables, recipes, and indexes. It fosters an objectified sense of time, a linear conception of space. It separates the message from the author and from the context in which it was written, thereby \u2018decontextualizing,\u2019 or universalizing the meaning of, language\u2026 Share The problem with writing The permanence of writing is the traditional reason we uphold writing. But it also leads to a strong intuition we all operate within: the written word is more real or authentic than the spoken version of the word. And it can create a hyper-awareness in us that makes writing incredibly difficult and forced. Here\u2019s Elbow, citing another researcher. \u201cWe usually notice the words \u2014 as words \u2014more often when we read a text than when we listen to speech. The difference is most pronounced\u2026 when we are learning to read\u2014trying to say the words one at a time and even sounding them out, letter by letter. Olson argues that we never fully lose that awareness even when we become fluent and automatic readers and think of ourselves as \u2018not seeing the words.\u2019 And when a text causes us even the slightest difficulty, we go back to consciousness of seeing words.\u201d For those of us working on improving our writing, it\u2019s useful to meditate on this feature of textuality. When we read a good book or text, we often talk about being \u201ccaught in the spell.\u201d There\u2019s a rich history of meanings behind that phrase, in particular a history of belief about the magic power of words, spells, charms, emblems. When we write, we are often attempting to leverage that power of orality, using the tools of textuality. 1 We want to use text for our purposes: to clarify our thinking, to help us see words as words and choose the most potent ones, to fill in the gaps of our lines of thoughts, and so on. But often we want our readers to have a different experience: not to see the "

Lake Constance gave J\u00fcnger the setting for his novel. On The Marble Cliffs by Ernst J\u00fcnger, translated from the German by Tess Lewis, introduction by Jessi Jezewska Stevens, afterword by Maurice Blanchot NYRB, 144 pp, $10.47 I haven\u2019t quite found the words yet, but this will be one of my favorite books of the year. It\u2019s a dream of an allegory, something like Lewis\u2019s Till We Have Faces , with that same kind of radiant truer-than-true brilliance. Translator Tess Lewis, in another essay , taught me the German word Wortschatz , or word-hoard. Marble Cliffs is back in vogue owing to her new translation of the J\u00fcnger novella, which comes across at once as deeply Germanic, with its wortschatz of recurring compounds (\u201cwisemen,\u201d \u201clanceheads,\u201d \u201cspellbound\u201d), and as Ancient Greek, although perhaps the latter is the result of the setting: sheer marble cliffs overlooking a Mediterranean lake, ringed by vineyards and a little monastery. J\u00fcnger\u2019s unnamed Mary Sue is a botanist with a Linnaean fixation, trusting that words, wielded correctly, order the world. I won\u2019t spoil the fantasy, except to say that not much happens, and that which does happen is telegraphed from the very first page. But it\u2019s all conveyed with astonishing, piercing intensity and a narrative stillness that doesn\u2019t waver even in the kinetic final scene. Originally published in 1939, J\u00fcnger\u2019s anti-Nazi allegory was the only regime-critical book allowed to reach print, and reached then-viral reach before getting kiboshed in 1942 by the Gestapo. In an afterword, J\u00fcnger describes how popular the book became on the front lines and in occupied Paris, where he spent the war as a kind of military dilettante. According to Bruce Chatwin , \u201cHow it slipped through the censor machine of Dr. Goebbels is less of a mystery when one realizes that Braquemart [a minor character] was modeled on Dr. Goebbels himself, who was flattered and amused by it, and later alarmed by its popularity among the officer caste.\u201d J\u00fcnger was a strange bird: vigorously anti-Nazi, but from the right; all cold clarity in the heat of battle, but a true aesthete who later wrote extensively about his experiences with psychedelics; a staunch German nationalist who found himself overcome with self-revulsion on seeing Jewish girls wearing the yellow star. Subscribe Young Lords and Their Traces Theaster Gates Exhibition, The New Museum J\u00fcnger, for all his activity, was an archivist, committed to saving things from destruction. Chatwin: \u201cIndeed, he had saved a lot of things in the blitzkrieg. A week earlier, he had saved the Cathedral of Laon from looters. He had saved the city\u2019s library with its manuscripts of the Carolingian kings. And he had employed an out-of-work wine waiter to inspect some private cellars and save some good bottles for himself.\u201d Like J\u00fcnger, Chicago South Side artist Theaster Gates specializes in salvaging precious items, and seems to exert a magnetic pull on them. His lapidary survey exhibition at the New Museum just closed, but here\u2019s a good video tour. It was full of stuff : a Russian scholar\u2019s 20,000 book strong library, African tribal sculptures, a Hammond B3, hairpins and doodads from black cultural figures. There\u2019s an interesting tension in Gates\u2019 work: he professes a black radicalism, but his process is deeply conservative, focused as it is on memory and physical artifacts. I\u2019ve read two especially provocative essays recently on global development. Michael Walzer, Revolutionologist \u201cBut instead of proffering the American Revolution as a model for the emerging nations of the decolonizing world, American policy-makers in the 1950s and \u201960s rolled out a more all-encompassing program: modernization theory. This was the self-flattering story that explained the labor of decolonization and global capitalist integration as a manageable and inevitable process: the entry of new nations into modernity itself. The theory was consecrated in Walt Rostow\u2019s The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto (1960), an inverted Leninist tract that neatly substituted a liberal end point for history in place of a communist one. By 1968, the leading historian of American liberalism, Louis Hartz, appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and explained that the Third World revolutions were more akin to the birth pangs of Europe leaving the Middle Ages than either the French or American Revolution.\u201d The Long Slow Death of Global Development The thesis: the vast majority of successful globalization has occurred in China (and to a lesser extent the rest of East Asia), while much of the third world has not progressed much at all, or minimally without moving substantial chunks of its population from poverty into lower-middle class status. The East Asian success story has left these countries no room for a transition to manufacturing, but deagrarianization has already occurred, leaving them trapped in a service-based, informal economy system in which masses of underemployed young men create political instability. Here\u2019s the first page and a half of On The Marble Cliffs : You all know the fierce melancholy that overcomes us at the memory of happy times. How irrevocably these have fled, and we find ourselves separated from them by something even more pitiless than vast distances. In the afterglow, too, these images appear even more enticing; we think of them as we do of a dead lover's body, buried deep in the ground, now appearing before us like a mirage, and we tremble at its greater, more spiritual splendor. Again and again, in our parched dreams we grope for every detail, every lineament of the past. And we feel we have not been allotted our full share of life and love, yet no amount of regret can bring back what we have lost. Oh, if only this emotion could serve as a lesson for every moment of happiness we do enjoy! And the memory of our years under sun and moon become sweeter still when fear has put an abrupt end to them. Only then do we recognize how fortunate we humans are to live from day to day in our small communities, under peaceful roofs, engaged in pleasant conversation, and with affectionate greetings morning and night. Alas, we always recognize too late that these simple things offered us a cornucopia of riches. So it is that I, too, look back on the years we lived on the Grand Marina- only in memory are their charms revealed. To be sure, at the time it seemed that many a problem and care clouded our days and above all that we needed be on guard against the Head Forester. That is why we lived with a certain austerity and dressed simply even though bound by no vow. Twice a year, however, we let our garments' rich red lining show--once in spring and once in autumn.

A frank study of native history requires nuance and moderation. Indigenous Continent: The Epic Contest for North America by Pekka H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen (2022, Liveright), 592 pages. In Indigenous Continent , Finnish historian Pekka H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen reinterprets the colonization of North America as an encounter between civilizational and political equals. It is a major undertaking, and it\u2019s not clear that he manages to back up his core contentions. But even in partial failure, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen illuminates the complex relationship between American and indigenous power. The book takes as its subject all of North America, from Columbus\u2019s arrival to the Battle of Wounded Knee. It contends that Native nations functionally ruled the continent for centuries after colonists arrived, and the U.S. didn\u2019t establish political hegemony over the continent until the late 19th century. Indigenous imperial power forced French, English, and Spanish colonists to settle in specific locations and extracted constant tribute from them as a precondition for survival. \u201cColonists could do very little in North America without Native support and consent,\u201d he explains, \u201ca constraint that drove them to radically calibrate their ambitions.\u201d The Iroquois, Comanche, and Lakota (Sioux) appear in this grand narrative as the formidable indigenous empires of the New World. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen is at his best when highlighting that much of great power politics in North America had little to do with white colonists or their young nation. Wars in the interior between the Seven Council Fires of the Sioux, the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and other polities dramatically reshaped population flows and political boundaries. To their white contemporaries, struggling to survive on narrow strips of coastal or riverine land, these imperial wars were often invisible. Well into the 1700s, the western interior was assumed by many Europeans to consist of a \u201cSea of the West\u201d that led directly to China. The new technologies of guns, powder, metal, and horses intensified indigenous military encounters in the interior. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, perhaps the world\u2019s preeminent scholar of the \u201c expansionist equestrian regimes \u201d the Comanche and Lakota, argued in his previous books that the arrival of the horse into the American West gave rise to new imperial forms. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen understands these nations as colonial, no less so than the American model. \u201cThe systematic repetition of key political acts,\u201d including raids, tribute extraction, and diplomatic missions, made up the power projection of Lakotas and Comanches. Only an American innovation in mobility, the railroad, allowed the federal government to finally impose its own order on the indigenous interior. By contrast, H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen struggles to back up his claim that smaller Indian nations wielded the power he wants to attribute to them. He admits Eastern seaboard nations used \u201cmore nuanced and delicate tactics,\u201d evading colonial powers through misdirection. Most often, Indian tribes and nations \u201ccannot stop the colonial advance, but can slow it down.\u201d It is unclear how this view is different from traditional historiography. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen commits to certain rhetorical techniques that struggle to hold up under scrutiny. Consistently, he describes both massacres and military victories by colonists as signs of weakness rather than strength. The Pequot and Raritan massacres \u201cdistort historical reality\u2026they make the colonies seem more powerful than they actually were,\u201d and they \u201cexposed a deep-rooted anxiety over enduring Indigenous power: the attacks were so vicious because the colonists feared the Indians who refused to submit to their rule.\u201d The argument is forced and made weaker by repetition. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen\u2019s perspective on brutality varies dramatically depending on who is committing it. The Iroquois practice of \u201ccaressing\u201d bound captives with firebrands and boiling and eating their corpses is a ceremony for peace. \u201cRitual absorption of enemy bodies and souls\u2026eased the Iroquois\u2019s pain and helped them regain reason; it restored normalcy.\u201d When Susquehannock war bands torture their prisoners to death, they are \u201coverwhelmed by grief and driven by distress.\u201d Elaborate Lakota diagrams made out of severed body parts are \u201ccommunicating through violence.\u201d H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen missteps in speaking about religious encounters with Indians, treating them as less real than economic interactions. The Indians\u2019 presence did not \u201cthreaten the souls\u201d of the Puritans, and Puritan attempts to convert Indians were not simply cover for an \u201cunderlying, unspoken impulse\u201d to turn them into productive laborers. The text mysteriously glides through the Revolutionary War, a crucial inflection point in Indian history, as well as the arrival and devastation of alcohol in Indian country. At various points in H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen\u2019s story, both Native and American leaders believe that a social union could improve both peoples. Cherokee women welcomed the arrival of modern farming and home building techniques. Thomas Jefferson openly desired Indian and white settlements to \u201cmeet and blend together, to intermix and become one people.\u201d Lewis and Clark\u2019s expedition was as much diplomatic as it was exploratory, including more than fifty conferences with Indian leaders and a summit in the Lakota \u201ccapital.\u201d That vision of mutualist cultural assimilation is now largely lost. It may never have been possible, even before Wounded Knee. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen\u2019s perspective, recognizing Native nations as genuine powers in all their awfulness and splendor, may help reconstruct this vision. But his overbroad thesis makes it difficult to fully buy it. This article appears in the November/December 2022 issue This is not a paywall!

Gesturing at the little apartment around us and the skyscrapers beyond, he said, \"It just takes one corrupt politician paid off by developers, to turn some lovely neighborhood into this .\" If, unlike that field specialist, you think the existence of New York City is generally a good thing, you will enjoy M. Nolan Gray\u2019s Arbitrary Lines: How Zoning Broke the American City and How to Fix It , a slim book that articulates the historic and economic case for YIMBY (Yes In My BackYard) politics. But in the interest of building a big tent coalition, Arbitrary Lines also leaves out some of the most compelling arguments for zoning reform. Gray bounds his argument carefully. He is a vicious critic of zoning itself, the practice of segregating land uses and regulating densities, but makes clear urban planning is not his target. His attack on zoning comes from four directions: Zoning has created an affordability crisis, it has taken a bite out of economic growth, it encourages and at times enforces racial segregation, and it causes environmentally damaging, spiritually deadening suburban sprawl. Gray acknowledges his goal of shifting the \"Overton window\" by limiting his critique to zoning, which is often purposefully opaque and run by feckless local bureaucrats. It\u2019s primarily an economic argument slightly abutted by the argument from racial justice (\"zoning remains first and foremost a tool of racial and economic exclusion\"). Gray tells us that \"by blocking the growth of our most productive cities, zoning is stunting growth and innovation nationwide .\" Alain Bertaud\u2019s model of the city as labor market features prominently: Cities that allow people to live densely near their work experience far greater economic growth than those that impose finicky zoning rules. The economic argument is powerful: Gray notes that one in four American renters spends more than half their income on rent. In New York City, \"zoning regulations restrict the number of apartments that can be subdivided within a building, not out of any health and safety concerns, but simply to restrict housing production.\" And many suburban and rural zoning codes outright ban manufactured housing. These regulatory burdens are often imposed by corrupt or venal local politicians. Gray argues that our model of the home as an investment vehicle is a relatively new phenomenon, dating back to a particular mix of 1970s inflation and tax code innovations. The \"homevoter hypothesis\" comes in for particular criticism for the vicious cycle it created. \"A mixture of rapid inflation and generous federal tax policies heavily incentivized the treatment of a home as an investment, which in turn provided homeowners with an even stronger incentive to oppose new housing construction.\" To many readers, particularly the younger and more online, these critiques will not be foreign. YIMBY political organizing has become one of the few bipartisan issues in my age cohort, uniting center-left wonk types and \"I just want to grill\" right-wingers against the far left and older homeowners. But Gray stays away from the rawest nerves of the zoning debate. One of the reasons the YIMBY movement skews so young is that my age group sees zoning as a tool of generational warfare, wielded by boomers who castigate the young for their dissolute ways while barring the developments that would allow them to change their lifestyles. Gray also stays away from the value-laden conservative case for fixing our zoning problem. Every behavior that the right would like to see more of in younger generations\u2014getting married, settling down, having kids, putting down roots\u2014is out of reach for increasing numbers of Americans. Culture obviously shapes those norms, but so does lack of material availability. Why even consider moving to the suburbs and having a couple kids if you\u2019re priced out and your commute time will triple? Like NEPA , the environmental review law that often bars environmental improvements, too much zoning aimed at encouraging quiet family neighborhoods has the side effect of discouraging family formation in the first place. Arbitrary Lines also highlights the role of the federal government in driving restrictive zoning, and the tools at its disposal to reverse that trend. Rather than allowing municipalities that break \"fair housing\" laws to \"make it right\" with \"antiracism poster competitions,\" the federal government could simply stop providing HUD dollars to those municipalities. There is value to local control over neighborhoods. But Gray points out that the current zoning model doesn\u2019t even do much of that. Zoning in many municipalities is so restrictive that new buildings are largely at the discretion of a handful of bureaucrats, through variances, special permits, rezonings, and planned unit developments. It\u2019s an argument that will be reminiscent to conservative free-marketers: \"In every other sphere of public policy, the idea that this anachronistic style of top-down planning can achieve even passable outcomes has been thoroughly discredited. Why is zoning any different?\" Ultimately, Arbitrary Lines makes its appeal to the right on classically liberal economic lines. But it avoids the more charged, socially conservative arguments that may carry greater weight. Arbitrary Lines: How Zoning Broke the American City and How to Fix It by M.

Google would be a good start,\" the Peter Thiel acolyte Blake Masters told the Washington Free Beacon . Masters, 34, announced his candidacy on Monday, making him the fifth GOP contender in what is shaping up to be a crowded field. The tech executive, who was Thiel\u2019s student at Stanford a decade ago, is a political neophyte largely unknown in Republican politics now vying for the chance to unseat Democrat Mark Kelly in what is likely to be one of the most important Senate races of the 2022 cycle. A win over Kelly, also a political newcomer, could be enough to flip the Senate. Having made his career in Silicon Valley, Masters is well-versed on the political issues posed by Big Tech. He is less confident in the articulation of his views on foreign policy. Asked whether he supports an American reentry into the Obama administration\u2019s Iran deal\u2014and about whether the U.S. should condition aid to Israel, as an increasing number of Democrats believe\u2014he voiced general opposition to the deal and offered to follow up with detailed answers. Masters is boosted by a $10 million donation from Thiel, and his candidacy is one demonstration of the PayPal cofounder\u2019s attempts to assert political clout. The Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance, also a former Thiel employee, received an identical $10 million donation. In fact, Masters says he and Vance are friends, that he is backing the Hillbilly Elegy author in another crowded Republican primary, and that their political views are similar. \"Broadly, I think we\u2019re running on pretty similar platforms,\" Masters says. Like Vance, Masters is an advocate for a sort of populist economics that is gaining traction within the Republican Party as it grapples to piece together policy proposals that represent former president Donald Trump\u2019s attitudinal governance. He praises the Biden administration\u2019s Federal Trade Commission chairwoman Lina Khan, a bugbear for many conservatives, for her aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement, and champions a move away from an antitrust doctrine known as the consumer welfare standard first popularized by the conservative legal giant Robert Bork. \"I think you give up in advance if you look at standards from 100 years ago,\" Masters says, \"You\u2019re just tying your hands. That\u2019s what conservatives have done for a long time. You get rigid about the status quo, about a particular orthodoxy, and you fail to update your views based on real-world consequences.\" Masters sounds a Trumpian note on globalization, a topic he wrote about critically as Thiel\u2019s co-author in the business bestseller Zero to One . \"There\u2019s no free trade with China,\" he says. \"They subsidize their industry, they dump steel. When that happens, we have the right to respond with a tariff.\" Masters holds senior positions at Thiel Capital and Thiel\u2019s charitable foundation. But he dismissed concerns about Thiel\u2019s influence on the campaign. \"It\u2019s my campaign, it\u2019s not Peter\u2019s campaign,\" he says, adding that Thiel \"sees some promise in me, but he knows I\u2019ll be an independent-minded senator.\" Democrats have for years worked to move Arizona into the blue column. Although it was once a red state represented by Republicans John McCain and Jon Kyl, President Joe Biden prevailed over Donald Trump in the state in 2020 by a narrow margin. The state is now represented by two Democratic senators, and Republicans are looking for an opportunity to pick off Kelly, who won a special election last year and will face voters again in 2022. Masters, a Tucson native, says he is focusing his campaign on immigration, big tech censorship, and what he calls \"pro-family policy.\" He\u2019s an immigration hawk who is calling for a return to the Trump administration\u2019s \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, which the Biden administration reversed. The rule required asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their cases were adjudicated in the United States. \"Halting construction of the border wall and practically inviting people to come in had predictably disastrous consequences,\" Masters says. Masters will face off against the solar power executive Jim Lamon and Arizona attorney general Mark Brnovich, who is entering the primary on the heels of a Supreme Court victory that vindicated the state\u2019s voting regulations.

The House Select Committee on the January 6th Attack also subpoenaed Reddit and Alphabet, Google's parent company. In a letter, the committee said it was investigating \"what steps\u2014if any\u2014social media companies took to prevent their platforms from being breeding grounds for radicalizing people to violence.\" The letter named Facebook, now called Meta, and YouTube, an Alphabet subsidiary, as particularly negligent. But it said all four companies subpoenaed were \"unwilling to commit to voluntarily and expeditiously\" cooperating with the committee. The committee also said \"Twitter has failed to disclose critical information.\" In the immediate aftermath of the Jan. 6 riots, several big tech platforms cut off access to conservative social media site Parler, blaming it for hosting the planning of the riot. But recent investigations found many of the rioters organized on large platforms like Facebook. Some rioters live-streamed their entrances to the Capitol on YouTube. The subpoena follows an August 2021 request for relevant documents to 15 social media platforms, including several pro-Trump forums. Twitter, Facebook, and Google have become flashpoints on Capitol Hill after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked a trove of internal documents. Haugen testified to Senate Democrats that Facebook \"cannot adequately identify dangerous content.\" Some conservatives worry the Jan. 6th committee may use the subpoenas to crack down on free speech on major tech platforms. All four companies subpoenaed have restricted conservative users on their sites. Twitter and Facebook suppressed claims of Kyle Rittenhouse's innocence and censored stories about Hunter Biden in the months before the 2020 election. The committee says it is working to address \"the spread of false information\" on social media platforms. Recent moves by congressional Democrats have exacerbated conservative worries about government overreach in tech. House Democrats have called for legislation that would punish tech platforms for user posts that cause \"emotional injury\" to other users. Senate Democrats have endorsed \"racial equity audits\" from their close friends as another tool to control the behavior of social media companies.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected Facebook's motion to dismiss the FTC's lawsuit, which alleges that Facebook's purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram were anticompetitive. If the suit is successful, Facebook could be forced to spin off the subsidiaries, two of its most valuable assets after the Facebook platform itself. The court's decision reverses its June ruling, which held that the FTC's lawsuits were too vague. At the time, District Judge James Boasberg said the FTC had not proven that Facebook's 60-percent share of the market for \"Personal Social Networking services\" constituted a monopoly. He directed the FTC to refile the suits with a narrower, more specific argument. The FTC's amended filing alleges Facebook has bought competitors WhatsApp and Instagram with the aim of destroying competitors. It also notes that Facebook retains users following major scandals, a sign of market power. Boasberg found the revised suit \"far more robust and detailed than before, particularly in regard to the contours of Defendant's alleged monopoly.\" The case is widely seen as a test of President Joe Biden's FTC appointees, who have set their sights on curbing Big Tech. FTC chairwoman Lina Khan has prioritized curbing tech power at the agency. Another Biden FTC nominee, Alvaro Bedoya, has criticized big tech for violating user privacy. Critics say, however, that Khan is stretching the law to go after tech companies. Republicans in Congress have attacked tech companies for restricting speech on their platforms but are divided on providing the FTC with more power. Republican senators Josh Hawley (Mo.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa), and Tom Cotton (Ark.) have all cosponsored bills that would give the FTC more authority over tech companies.

Mandel says Facebook's actions cost the company six months of advertising data. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment but told Heroes of Liberty it was being punished for \"consistently promoting ads that don't comply\" with Facebook's standards. \"We just assumed we were going to be safe from big tech censorship because we are so plain vanilla,\" Mandel told the Washington Free Beacon. \"It's a children's book company. But even a children's book company will not be safe from the tentacles of big tech censorship.\" Heroes of Liberty publishes \"quality illustrated biographies of great Americans,\" including President Ronald Reagan and Supreme Court justice Amy Coney Barrett. Mandel said the company spent most of its marketing budget on Facebook ads. The company will now pivot to a subscription model. Mandel hopes the switch will stop tech companies from interfering with the company, though she acknowledges it is \"not what we normally do in America for books.\" Facebook is one of the biggest players in online advertising. The company earned more than $84 billion in advertising revenue in 2020, over a quarter of all U.S. ad revenue. The social media giant regularly shuts down right-leaning advertisers and individual users. In 2021, Facebook suspended the Instagram account of a Gold Star mother who criticized President Joe Biden and blocked ads for a song that criticized Biden's Afghanistan withdrawal. Facebook also removed a political ad that criticized the withdrawal, suppressed claims that Kyle Rittenhouse was innocent, and blocked a Russian activist from posting evidence of abuse of political prisoners. While Facebook regularly bans right-wing content, it also maintains a \"whitelist\" of nearly six million prominent users who are exempt from the platform's rules. At press time, Facebook allowed ads for a children's book titled Who Was Fidel Castro? , which describes the Communist leader as \"a boy who loved sports\" and \"a lawyer for the poor.\" Published under: Amy Coney Barrett , Big Tech , Censorship , Facebook , Ronald Reagan Facebook Bans Conservative Children's Book Publisher Social media giant calls patriot picture book ads 'disruptive' MacKenzie Scott Sends Millions to Terror-Tied Nonprofit Network Bring in More Prosecutors: Finally Ending Minnesota\u2019s \u2018Never-Ending\u2019 Somali Fraud Schemes Requires Reinforcements Take My Governor\u2014Please Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Prepared To Flee to Moscow if Regime Loses Control Walz Drops Reelection Bid as Minnesota Reels From Massive Welfare Fraud Facebook Bans Conservative Children's Book Publisher Politics Trump Resolves the Maduro Problem The Foreign Policy Winners and Losers of 2025 As Europe Steps Back, Asia Steps Up Newsletters Morning Beacon Heroes of Liberty Facebook ads"

Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) took steps on Thursday to ban a new Chinese digital currency from government devices, arguing that China could use the currency to surveil people around the world. Blackburn told the Washington Free Beacon that the ban, introduced as an amendment to the Senate's omnibus infrastructure bill, is needed to prevent China from stealing information. \"The People\u2019s Bank of China is trying to use this as a way to hack into networks,\" Blackburn said. \"Once you\u2019ve got them in your wallet, you\u2019ll have them in your wallet from now on.\" China is rolling out the digital currency in an attempt to better surveil its users and to create an alternative to traditional financial systems backed by the U.S. dollar. Lawmakers are sounding the alarm about the digital yuan ahead of the 2022 Olympics, where Chinese officials plan to test the currency more broadly. Blackburn, Sen. Roger Wicker (R., Miss.), and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R., Wyo.) last month asked the U.S. Olympic Committee to ban American Olympians from using the currency at the Beijing games. Blackburn told the Free Beacon the digital yuan is part of a larger push by China to displace the United States as a world leader. \"We know that China is seeking to push the yuan as the currency that countries will peg to,\" she said. \"We\u2019re attentive to the aggressiveness they are exercising when they push this as the standard.\" Blackburn\u2019s amendment would give the Office of Management and Budget two months to develop standards to remove the digital yuan wallet app from government-issued devices. Most digital currencies give users anonymity. But the digital yuan allows the Chinese Communist Party to monitor transactions in real time. Yaya Fanusie, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said, \"The CCP recently released a notice that Mongolian families who didn\u2019t send their children to state-mandated schools would be put on a blacklist. The digital yuan would allow the government to combine financial data with lists like that.\" The lack of anonymity could allow the CCP to manipulate users in other ways. China has already experimented with setting expiration dates on some yuan to encourage users to spend them quicker. Chinese officials have pushed back on American concerns about surveillance. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters on Tuesday that U.S. politicians should \"figure out what a digital currency really is.\" He added, \"The U.S. politicians should abide by the spirit stipulated in the Olympic Charter, stop making sports a political matter and stop making troubles out of the digital currency in China.\" The People\u2019s Bank of China says over 20.8 million people have opened a wallet to store digital yuan since China started testing the currency in 2019. The digital yuan is mainly used for domestic retail transactions, but the People\u2019s Bank says it hopes to use it for cross-border transactions. Since the digital yuan is not denominated in dollars, its widespread use could make U.S. sanctions less potent. China is not the only country to consider a digital currency. The European Union plans to create a digital euro. In response, both Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell have said they are looking into the possibility of a U.S. digital currency, although some experts have questioned whether the United States needs such a currency, given the dominance of the dollar.

Researchers at Top10VPN determined that 17 of the 69 countries studied use the Chinese telecom giant's hardware to enforce censorship laws. Cuba uses Huawei's \"middlebox\" devices to censor stories that criticize the country's communist regime. In Burundi, the government blocks media outlets that have criticized the president. Fifteen other countries use Huawei hardware specifically to censor news, the report found. Huawei is deeply embedded in internet networks across the world, particularly in countries with close economic ties to China. Huawei's founder is a member of the Chinese Communist Party. Through its Belt and Road Initiative, China has pushed to integrate technology from state-backed companies like Huawei into foreign networks. Huawei's involvement in censorship regimes suggests China is finding common ground with authoritarians across the globe. In an interview with the Committee to Protect Journalists, report authors Valentin Weber and Vasilis Ververis warn that Huawei's tools could also be used to violate user privacy. The pair said it is unclear where user data are sent after they reach Huawei middleboxes. But Ververis, a cybersecurity researcher at Oxford, said he \"would not be surprised if that data was being sold or analyzed.\" A comparison of this report with Weber's 2019 report found that 9 of the 17 countries that use Huawei tools to censor news have adopted them since 2019. Huawei has become a political flashpoint in the United States. Lawmakers worry that allowing the company to operate on American soil could give the Chinese government access to U.S. citizens' data. Both the Trump and Biden administrations placed Huawei on a blacklist.

The Saudi government sentenced Ali Abu Luhum, a Yemeni citizen, to 15 years in prison for promoting \"apostasy, unbelief, and atheism\" on Twitter. Saudi officials linked anonymous Twitter accounts to phone numbers connected to Abu Luhum, according to Human Rights Watch. It is unclear how they made the connection, since the phone numbers were not publicly displayed. But Saudi Arabia has a history of paying spies to gather information on dissidents from the site, in which the Saudi government owns a major stake. In 2015, the FBI warned Twitter it had a \"Saudi espionage problem.\" In an email to the Washington Free Beacon , a Twitter spokesman declined to comment. The arrest comes as Twitter faces criticism for inconsistently applying its free speech policies. The site claims it is a staunch defender of free speech but has blocked conservatives and restricted discussion of politically sensitive topics. Twitter also allowed major Taliban accounts to broadcast propaganda as the terror group captured Kabul. Saudi officials claim Abu Luhum's since-deleted tweets promoted \"that which prejudices public order, religious values, and public morals.\" The Saudi government often uses vague language of this sort to justify silencing dissent. Twitter has long had a problem with Saudi infiltration. In 2014, the Saudi government paid a Twitter employee named Ahmad Abouammo more than $100,000 to collect information about Saudi dissidents. The following year, the FBI warned Twitter that more than one employee had been compromised by the Saudis. Two sources at Twitter tell the Free Beacon that the company will take pains to maintain friendly relations with Saudi Arabia. The Arab country is the largest Twitter market in the Middle East and has the highest Twitter users per capita of any country other than the United States and Japan. The Saudi government owns a major stake in Twitter, one that is allegedly larger than the stake held by former CEO Jack Dorsey. Six months after Twitter was informed of Saudi espionage, Dorsey was photographed meeting with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. High-ranking Saudi officials who appear to have been involved in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi have kept their Twitter accounts. Saudi influencers say the government has forced them to tweet propaganda or risk having private information about them shared on Twitter.

Michael Cloud (R., Texas). (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Santi Ruiz December 17, 2021 image/svg+xml House Republicans are calling on Facebook to explain whether it alerts law enforcement when human traffickers advertise on the site. In a Friday letter to Mark Zuckerberg, Rep. Michael Cloud (R., Texas) and seven other members of the GOP\u2019s Big Tech task force asked whether Facebook communicates with Customs and Border Protection about criminal posts. The letter cites reports of Mexican smugglers using Facebook to promote their services to Central American migrants seeking to enter the United States. Mexican cartels have cashed in on the human smuggling business, according to Border Patrol agents. Cloud\u2019s letter asks Facebook to explain how many accounts it has blocked this year \"to prevent the facilitation of human smuggling.\" Facebook officials have been vague about whether the company reports illegal immigration content to authorities. In a July letter responding to questions from Arizona attorney general Mark Brnovich, Facebook executive William Castleberry said the company allows content \"about how to enter a country illegally or request information about how to be smuggled.\" But the letter also says that \"where appropriate\" Facebook reports criminal activity to law enforcement. Facebook claims it consulted with \"human rights experts\" to craft its policy allowing posts advertising illegal border crossings. Castleberry said Facebook \"developed this policy to ensure we were prohibiting content relating to the business of human smuggling but not interfering with people\u2019s ability to exercise their right to seek asylum.\" The GOP letter asks Facebook to explain the distinction, and to name the \"human rights experts\" it consulted. The letter comes amid a massive spike in illegal border crossings. In October, Customs and Border Protection reported 164,000 apprehensions at the southern border, a 22-year high. Republicans want Facebook to help stanch that flow. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R, Wash.), who chairs the Big Tech task force, said tech companies are \"focused on silencing speech that doesn\u2019t fit the liberal orthodoxy\" rather than improving their work with law enforcement. Cloud echoed that statement, saying cartels have \"free rein\" to advertise on Facebook while dissenting viewpoints are barred. In October, Brnovich asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Facebook\u2019s handling of cartel and trafficker content. \"Facebook identifies no mechanism to distinguish between authorized and unauthorized posts, nor is it clear how it differentiates between the two,\" said Brnovich, who is running for Senate in Arizona. \"Ultimately, Facebook\u2019s enforcement mechanism is a paper tiger.\" Employees at Facebook and other tech companies frequently oppose cooperating with the federal government. In 2018, Google employees successfully blocked the company from working with the Department of Defense on drone technology. Amazon workers pressured the company to stop working with law enforcement agencies. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a request for comment.

A small group of organizations with close ties to Democratic politicians and progressive donors conducts the majority of these audits, which advocates say are needed to promote racial justice. But in practice, equity auditors often push companies to hire more left-wing activists and former Democratic party officials, often from the auditing organizations themselves. The audits also call for the abolition of standards of \"merit\" and the ability for a special executive to veto any company project. Racial equity audits are the chief service offered by \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" consultants, a cottage industry connected by a revolving door of Democratic staffers and funded by liberal donors. Equity auditors have made a killing from school districts that pay handsomely for consultants to revamp curricula, the Washington Free Beacon has reported . Now, racial equity auditors are setting their sights on corporate America. Democratic officials have called for audits of major companies. One proposal from House Democrats would fine companies $20,000 a day for not completing biennial, independent \"racial equity audits.\" In June, five Democratic senators called on Google parent company Alphabet to conduct an audit. The Democratic letter cited Color of Change, a left-wing nonprofit pushing for audits. Last week, Color of Change president Rashad Robinson was invited to testify to Congress and called for \"independent auditors\" to vet new products from tech companies before they\u2019re released. Robinson did not mention that the \"independent auditors\" are closely affiliated with Color of Change. In that hearing, Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) said Alphabet should \"work with civil rights groups who have developed a framework to guide tech companies on how to conduct racial equity audits.\" Booker's call appears to be a veiled reference to Color of Change, which released a \" tech framework \" explaining how companies should conduct audits. The framework calls for the destruction of an \"objective definition of merit\" in order to \"attract Black talent.\" It also requires that every tech company employ an executive with power to veto any product they believe has a disparate effect on black users. Among other powers, the executive should have \"hiring and firing power, power over promotions, and power over the flow of people, product, and money.\" Color of Change also calls on tech companies to evaluate every employee in \"anti-discrimination accountability systems\" in performance reviews. According to Color of Change, tech companies should be required to avoid the use of any dataset that \"is the product of real-world prejudice or further perpetuates discrimination,\" a vague definition that could be used to shut down almost any machine-learning research. Beyond \"hiring underrepresented groups,\" says Color of Change, organizations need to increase the \"awareness\" of all employees through \"comprehensive racial justice trainings and initiatives.\" These trainings from outside groups will create \"a critical mass of employees that are aware of the origins and effects of white supremacy and anti-Blackness across all vertical and horizontal work streams.\" Color of Change has already succeeded in using racial equity audits to shape big tech policy. In 2018, it successfully pushed Facebook into completing an audit that called for more restrictions on Trump's posts. Color of Change itself pushed for Trump to be permanently banned from the platform. After the audit was released, Facebook hired an Obama administration Justice Department official to lead the company's civil rights strategy. The audits fit within a broader push from Biden administration officials to promote racial justice goals in government policy. The Securities and Exchange Commission is pushing companies to include audit proposals from shareholders in their proxy statements. Federal Trade Commissioner Kelly Slaughter has argued her department has a mandate to tackle \"structural and systemic racism.\" Democratic officials and lawmakers have close personal and professional relationships with activist auditors. Laura Murphy, who pioneered corporate racial equity audits, was invited to conduct her first audit in 2016 by Vanita Gupta, a close friend who now serves as associate attorney general. Before joining the Biden Justice Department, Gupta led the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a nonprofit that has called for tech companies to \"reduce online activities and disinformation\" that harm minority groups. The conference commissioned a report by Murphy on \"Key Elements of a Civil Rights Audit.\" That report received input from powerful liber"

The \"Justice Against Malicious Algorithms Act\" would allow users to sue platforms for causing \"severe emotional injury,\" but does not specify a definition of emotional injury. Free speech advocates worry the law\u2019s vagueness would force platforms to delete more user speech to avoid being sued. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.) called the act \"a thinly veiled attempt to pressure companies to censor more speech.\" She said if \"companies will have to decide between leaving up content that may offend someone and fight it in court, or censor content that reaches a user\u2014which do you think they\u2019ll choose?\" Democrats and Republicans have both pushed for reforming Section 230, although for different reasons. Republicans say tech platforms should lose their immunity if they shut down conservative speech. But Democrats want to increase platforms' liability to push them to remove \"misinformation.\" Wednesday's hearing highlighted the substantial differences between the parties. Twitter and Facebook have regularly shut down conservative speech including criticism of President Joe Biden and removed discussion of the lab leak theory of COVID-19\u2019s origins. Democratic witness Rashad Robinson, president of a George Soros-backed advocacy group, called for more restrictions on free speech to combat \"misinformation.\" Robinson\u2019s group, Color of Change, has pushed for defunding the police . Robinson also serves on the Aspen Institute\u2019s Commission on Information Disorder, which called for a \"national response strategy\" to stop \"misinformation\" online. In the hearing, Robinson called for Congress to place legislative limits on the First Amendment, saying \"I understand that we have these conversations about the First Amendment, but there are limitations to what you can and cannot say.\" Democratic representatives largely agreed with Robinson that new regulations should curtail free speech. Many of them also called for requirements for social media platforms to \"deamplify\" content they view as objectionable. Democratic representative Darren Soto (Fla.) said \"lies are not free speech.\" Another Democratic panelist said freedom of speech is not \"freedom of reach.\" Rep. Tony C\u00e1rdenas (D., Calif.) fretted about the rise of disinformation in Spanish and called for more oversight of how Facebook moderates Spanish language content. Panelist and Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen responded that Spanish speakers were \"less safe\" than English speakers on the platform. Both sides found more common ground on protecting children from harm on social media, as Haugen pointed out that employees of tech companies tend to be childless.

Speaking to OANN host Pearson Sharp, Robert Herring denied that the conservative network supports Gigi Sohn, a lawyer with a history of opposing Fox News. Herring's son Charles last month published a letter on the OANN website that endorsed Sohn's confirmation. \"My son's out there saying we support her, but she shouldn't be anywhere near the FCC as far as I'm concerned,\" Herring said, adding explicitly that \"the company itself is not supporting her.\" Sharp called Sohn \"one of the most extreme leftists anywhere in Washington\" and \"a Marxist who has absolutely no regard for free speech or the Constitution.\" The Washington Free Beacon reported that Charles Herring lobbied Republican senators to support Sohn's nomination and booked political operative Bradley Blakeman to appear on OANN to tout Sohn's credentials. OANN and fellow right-wing TV network Newsmax both endorsed Sohn, hoping she would support them in fights against larger carriers. In her confirmation hearing last week, Sohn twice brought up OANN's support for her as evidence that she is not biased against conservatives. The family dispute adds more controversy to an already fraught nomination process. Sohn faces conservative opposition for her comments calling Fox News a threat to democracy and endorsing investigations into the company. A nonprofit Sohn founded, Public Knowledge, also called for OANN to be taken off the airwaves. It is unclear whether Sohn will be confirmed in the closely divided Senate. In an effort to secure Sohn's confirmation, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.) has proposed Sohn could recuse herself from certain issues, Fox reported Tuesday. A source familiar with the situation confirmed the proposal to the Free Beacon and said Sohn was considering recusing herself from issues regarding broadcast companies. The source said both Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and the White House have expressed concerns over a possible recusal deal, which would leave FCC commissioners evenly divided on hot-button regulatory issues.

Members of the Senate Commerce Committee tore into Gigi Sohn for what Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) called \"a history of antipathy toward conservative views.\" Sohn has called for the shuttering of right-wing networks repeatedly throughout her career and advocated for increased federal oversight of right-wing broadcasters. Sen. Dan Sullivan (R., Alaska) said these views \"completely disqualify\" Sohn from public office. Sohn, who Biden tapped to serve on the FCC last month, has gained unlikely allies in her nomination fight. Conservative stations Newsmax and One America News Network have both endorsed Sohn, who they believe will give them a competitive advantage over Fox News. Sohn has a history of opposing Fox, which she has called a danger to democracy. Sohn twice called attention to the two endorsements in her testimony, suggesting they are evidence she is not biased against conservatives. Sohn struggled to answer Sullivan's question about her claim that Fox is \"state-sponsored propaganda.\" \"I understand my tweets are concerning to some,\" Sohn said in the hearing, arguing it was \"part of her job\" as a public interest advocate to attack Fox. She said her opinions as an activist would have \"no bearing\" on her behavior in office. Sohn said her tweets were not evidence of bias and said her academic writings were \"just academic\" and would not have a bearing on her performance as a commissioner. Fox's Tucker Carlson slammed Sohn on Tuesday night, saying \"Sohn is for censorship and has said so many times online.\" Other industry organizations have expressed concern about her nomination. If confirmed, Sohn would give Democrats a 3-2 majority on the FCC. She has called for expanding the FCC's authority to investigate and regulate conservative television networks. Conservatives fear Sohn would use the FCC's regulatory power over broadcast licenses to punish right-wing media outlets. Sohn's nomination came shortly after the Senate Commerce Committee confirmed Jessica Rosenworcel to an open FCC spot. Rosenworcel is widely seen as a more moderate pick, but conservatives worry Sohn would pull the commission toward censorship. Sohn's allies argue she would be a supporter of small right-wing outlets. An executive at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit Sohn founded, said Sohn \"pushed for carriage rules that would get channels like Newsmax and OANN on Comcast.\" Public Knowledge has called for OANN to be removed from television. Another close Sohn ally called the United States a \"racist ass shithole country\" in November.

Gigi Sohn has called for expanding the FCC's authority to investigate and regulate conservative networks. She has suggested that one of the leading conservative broadcasting companies should not have a broadcast license and founded a nonprofit that is actively lobbying cable providers to drop the right-wing One America News Network (OANN). Sohn could soon have the power to act on these radical positions, which some say is cause for concern. \"There's reason for concern she'd take punitive action against conservative voices,\" one telecommunications expert told the Washington Free Beacon . Katie McAuliffe, the executive director of the pro-market nonprofit Digital Liberty, said Sohn has one major outlet to hamstring conservative media: She could \"use the broadcast licensing regime to challenge someone's use of the airwaves.\" Television networks need to obtain an FCC license to broadcast on the air. The agency has the authority to revoke licenses it has already issued. If confirmed, Sohn will be one of five commissioners who rule on broadcast licensure. Sohn has throughout her career indicated where she falls on this issue. After right-leaning network Sinclair in 2018 called off a merger with Tribune Broadcasting, Sohn questioned whether \"Sinclair is qualified to be a broadcast licensee at all.\" She has also called for congressional investigations into Fox News for broadcasting \"few if any opposing viewpoints.\" Licensure is not the only area in which Sohn has called for more aggressive FCC intervention. She last year endorsed the activist group Free Press after the group petitioned the FCC to make greater use of the \"broadcast hoax\" rule, which allows the agency to intervene when broadcasts cause \"substantial public harm\" to the public interest. Free Press says that former president Donald Trump's statements on the coronavirus could violate the \"broadcast hoax\" rule. The petition specifically names the former president's March 2020 claim that \"I hear the numbers are getting much better in Italy.\" Sohn is a longtime progressive activist known for her \"personal relationships with power players all over the capital,\" according to The Hill . She cofounded Public Knowledge, a nonprofit that \"promotes freedom of expression\" and \"an open internet.\" Public Knowledge president Christopher Lewis told the Free Beacon that the organization has no interest in government mandates against protected speech but said, \"It's hard for us to fight for free expression when there's so much disinformation.\" Although the group is working to pull OANN off the airwaves, Lewis asserts that the group remains committed to \"free expression and promoting diversity of content.\" The Free Beacon reported this month that OANN has thrown its weight behind Sohn's nomination in the hopes that she will be an ally in disputes with cable carriers. Sohn faces an uphill battle in the Senate, where she is expected to appear on December 1. Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) has called her \"a hack\" and vowed to fight her nomination. One source tells the Free Beacon that three or four Democratic senators are considering opposing Sohn because of her support for net neutrality.

Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) is demanding YouTube explain why it stripped ad revenue from a news channel that covered the disappearance of Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai, in a letter exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. Blackburn says YouTube's decision to make a video from the news program Breaking Points with Krystal and Saagar ineligible for most ads shows that the company is \"working with the CCP to promote its dangerous viewpoints around the world.\" She also asks the company to \"identify all other instances\" when it \"has demonetized, blocked, or deleted content at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party.\" Blackburn's letter refers to a video posted on Nov. 18 by Breaking Points that highlighted Peng, who disappeared for two weeks after alleging a high-ranking CCP official had raped her. The Free Beacon reported last week that YouTube's automatic review and manual review both flagged the video as inappropriate, denying Breaking Points a key revenue source. YouTube told the Free Beacon the video was not \"demonetized,\" since advertisers could still place ads on the video if they opted to advertise on the platform's blacklisted video list. YouTube did not respond to requests for comment on the percentage of advertisers who opt in. Peng's case has sparked international condemnation, with the Women's Tennis Association demanding her release. WTA CEO Steve Simon asked China's ambassador to the United States to assure Peng's health and safety on Friday, warning that the association might be forced to pull its business and events from China if Peng's allegations are not fully investigated. Chinese state media on Wednesday released a statement purportedly from Peng, in which the athlete recanted her allegation that former vice premier Zhang Gaoli sexually assaulted her. According to the statement, Peng said \"I'm not missing, nor am I unsafe. I've been resting at home and everything is fine.\" Human rights groups say Peng may be held in \"residential surveillance at a designated location,\" a common CCP tactic, and was likely pressured to provide the statement. International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach reportedly had a half-hour video call with Peng, and the committee said Peng \"is safe and well.\" But British anti-slavery activist Luke de Pulford noted on Twitter that Bach apparently has a friendly relationship with the alleged rapist.

The site blocked ads from running before the video, which outlined Peng's allegations that a senior CCP official raped her. YouTube said the video \"isn't suitable for all advertisers,\" a likely nod to advertisers with ties to China. YouTube frequently \"demonetizes\" videos that break the site's rules, a move that prevents creators from making money off their videos. Google, which owns YouTube, is not the only big tech company to carefully monitor content that could be critical of China. LinkedIn has censored British and American critics of the CCP and recently overhauled its LinkedIn China product to remove user posts. Until earlier this year, Facebook removed posts that alleged that COVID-19 came from a Chinese laboratory. Microsoft this year has deepened its collaboration with the Chinese government. Apple spent $90,000 to lobby against a bill that would punish companies that use Chinese slave labor. YouTube's automated review system immediately flagged the video, which was shared by Breaking Points with Krystal and Saagar , an online news show. Breaking Points cohost Saagar Enjeti told the Washington Free Beacon that YouTube might have flagged the video because its title contains the word rape . YouTube has blamed its automated content moderation system for incorrectly removing videos. But when Breaking Points on Friday appealed for a manual review, YouTube upheld the decision. Enjeti said that manual reviews have always restored content that YouTube automatically flagged. He also noted that this demonetization is the first time YouTube has interfered with the show's China-related content. \"It's possible that this could be the result of influence from the CCP,\" Enjeti told the Free Beacon . \"Or, at the very least, YouTube has to understand advertisers like Nike and other massive multinationals may be worried\" about running ads alongside stories critical of the regime. Enjeti said the incident highlights how much power tech companies have to determine what news is appropriate. Reached for comment, a YouTube spokesman said the video \"was never demonetized,\" but placed in a category of flagged content that third-parties must opt in to advertise on. The spokesman did not say how many advertisers choose to run ads on videos YouTube has flagged as sensitive. Peng, who in 2011 ranked as the 14th greatest female tennis player in the world, has not been heard from since she made the rape allegation against former Chinese vice premier Zhang Gaoli. Chinese state media on Wednesday released a statement they said was from Peng, recanting her accusations.

One America News Network (OANN) is working behind the scenes to rally conservative support for Gigi Sohn, President Joe Biden\u2019s latest pick to serve on the Federal Communications Commission. Conservative political operative Bradley Blakeman told the Washington Free Beacon that OANN's president personally arranged for him to appear in a pro-Sohn segment on the network and that OANN executives believe Sohn will be an ally in the network\u2019s fight to wrest market share away from Fox News. The belief is rooted in Sohn's criticism of Fox News. Sohn has questioned whether Fox News should be investigated for being \"state-sponsored propaganda with few if any opposing viewpoints.\" Fox News and OANN compete for many of the same viewers, and former president Donald Trump encouraged his voters to leave Fox News for OANN or right-wing outlet Newsmax. Sohn has called for the FCC to intervene in disputes between major cable companies and smaller content providers like OANN. In 2018, OANN, Newsmax, and Sohn found themselves fighting on the same side against the more powerful conservative network Sinclair. According to Blakeman, OANN executives believe that, if confirmed, Sohn will support them in \"carriage disputes\" with carriers like AT&T and Comcast. OANN president Charles Herring endorsed Sohn in a letter last week, praising her \"strong belief and advocacy for diversity in the programming lineup.\" A source with knowledge of the situation said Herring is meeting with Republican senators on Capitol Hill to advance Sohn's nomination. He also arranged for Blakeman, a former adviser to George W. Bush, to praise Sohn on the air. In an interview that aired Friday on OANN, Blakeman noted approvingly that Sohn \"disagrees with\" cancel culture and touted her regulatory credentials. Blakeman told the Free Beacon that OANN\u2019s endorsement of Sohn has everything to do with business and that Herring personally encouraged him to come on OANN. \"Anytime a business makes a statement, you have to attribute some of that statement, all of that statement sometimes, to selfish business interests,\" Blakeman said. But OANN and others insist Sohn would be an ally to conservatives. A friend and adviser to Sohn backing her nomination told the Free Beacon that the support from OANN shows conservatives want someone to stand up to large media outlets. Former Mississippi Republican congressman Chip Pickering is also expected to publicly endorse Sohn, the adviser said. Blakeman said he was not aware of other Republicans expected to come out in support. A Republican source familiar with the issue called OANN\u2019s belief that Sohn will support the company in its carriage disputes \"farcical\" and \"a hail mary.\" Republican senators have criticized Sohn for her criticism of Fox News as \"propaganda.\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said he \"will do everything in [his] power\" to block her nomination and called her \"unqualified\" and \"a hack.\" Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.), John Thune (R., S.D.), and Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) also expressed concern . Sohn was initially scheduled to appear this week in a confirmation hearing alongside moderate FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel, whom Biden nominated for an additional term on the commission. A Senate staffer with knowledge of the nomination process said Republican opposition to Sohn prompted Commerce Committee chairwoman Sen. Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.) to postpone Sohn\u2019s hearing to December. The friend and adviser to Sohn blamed the Biden administration for taking almost a year to announce the nominations, calling the delay \"shameful.\" Even as OANN has backed Sohn, groups affiliated with Sohn have blasted conservative media. The day before Herring endorsed Sohn, a nonprofit she founded published a piece titled \"Why Cable and Satellite Providers Should Drop One America News Network.\" The piece called OANN \"a peddler of toxic lies.\" Blakeman and Sohn worked together on the Sports Fans Coalition, which works to \"protect fans from the wave of sports betting legalization.\" Blakeman met Sohn through former Bill Clinton aide David Goodfriend, whom a former FCC official said has been working behind the scenes to rally conservative support for her nomination. Sohn and OANN did not respond to requests for comment.

Microsoft China president Joe Bao called China the \"most dynamic and innovative place\" in the world in a speech at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai. Microsoft also announced it would be doubling its cloud capacity and launching a new data center in the country. Speaking to Shanghai Daily , Bao said , \"Every country in the world is looking to China as a role model for how to emerge from a pandemic today.\" He also suggested that Microsoft's Chinese operations are increasingly important to the company, noting that \"we really think that we have an opportunity to grow faster [in China] than Microsoft in the rest of the world.\" Microsoft regularly complies with the Chinese Communist Party to maintain access to the country's lucrative market. Last month, the company overhauled its LinkedIn product to satisfy government demands. In September, Microsoft president Brad Smith personally met with top Chinese officials to discuss deepening the company's relationship with China. Microsoft has completely revamped LinkedIn in China to comply with regulators, starting an identical platform that removes users' ability to post their opinions. LinkedIn regularly censors users, including journalists , for discussing topics the Chinese Communist Party considers sensitive, like Taiwan or Tiananmen Square. LinkedIn also censored a British national on his regular account after he criticized the Chinese government. Microsoft's close ties with the regime have not stopped Chinese hackers from repeatedly breaching the company's systems and stealing sensitive data from millions of American citizens. On Monday, Microsoft said a Chinese hacking group was attacking its systems. The same group was behind the SolarWinds hack , which accessed sensitive federal information from multiple government departments. Microsoft's top scientist reported to Congress earlier this year that \"China's domestic use of AI is a chilling precedent for anyone around the world who cherishes individual liberty.\" Two days after a major breach of Microsoft systems by Chinese hackers in March, Microsoft announced it would expand its cloud computing services in China.

Immediately after the anti-police riots that thrust Rittenhouse into the national spotlight, social media companies began to block users who expressed support for the Illinois teen. Twitter suspended the accounts of users who called Rittenhouse innocent, including the defendant's own lawyer. Facebook said it \"designated this shooting as a mass murder and ... removed the shooter\u2019s accounts from Facebook and Instagram.\" The platform also blocked searches for \"Kyle Rittenhouse.\" Social media platforms often intervene to suppress posts expressing a particular stance on controversial issues. Both platforms censored news stories about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop in the month before the 2020 election. Facebook blocked a Gold Star mother\u2019s criticism of President Joe Biden and suppressed a song that criticized the president. Twitter and Facebook also suspended users who oppose vaccine mandates. The fundraising platform GoFundMe also removed a page set up to support Rittenhouse, which the company said violated its ban on fundraisers involving \"the legal defense of alleged crimes associated with hate, violence, harassment, bullying, discrimination, terrorism, or intolerance.\" GoFundMe supported fundraising for the family of one of Rittenhouse\u2019s assailants, Anthony Huber. The site regularly hosts fundraisers for individuals associated with Black Lives Matter. \u200b When smaller platforms began raising funds for Rittenhouse, hackers breached the donation lists. News outlets doxxed paramedics and police officers who gave small donations to Rittenhouse\u2019s defense. Twitter is still banning or suspending users for supporting Rittenhouse, even as the trial proceeds. Facebook searches for Rittenhouse\u2019s name turn up no results. Neither platform responded to requests for comment. Rittenhouse faces six charges, including two counts of homicide, after shooting three men who attacked him during last August\u2019s anti-police riots in Kenosha, Wis. His murder trial began on Nov. 1. His defense hopes that videos that show rioters assaulting Rittenhouse will bolster his self-defense claim.

Meredith Whittaker announced Friday that she is joining the FTC as a \"Senior Advisor on AI,\" a position that reports directly to chairwoman Lina Khan. The former Google employee made headlines in 2019 for organizing walkouts in opposition to the company's partnership with the U.S. military. Internal reviews obtained by the Free Beacon show that Whittaker was repeatedly warned to focus on her job responsibilities and left Google in July 2019 after she was asked to take a more limited role following several critical performance reviews in the first quarter of that year. Under President Joe Biden, the FTC has embraced the far-left positions Whittaker espouses . Khan has argued that Amazon, Google, and others may be monopolies even if they don't raise prices for consumers. FTC commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter has said that antitrust enforcement \"can't be value-neutral\" and that the FTC has a mandate to tackle \"structural and systemic racism.\" Carl Szabo, vice president of tech industry group NetChoice, told the Free Beacon that Khan, Whittaker, and Slaughter share \"an obsession with using antitrust to shape progressive policy.\" Although Whittaker has presented herself as an expert in artificial intelligence ethics, some former colleagues have accused her of inflating her credentials, noting that she has no formal training in the field and has done no peer-reviewed research. One manager described her impact inside Google as \"nonexistent in the AI bias space, if not negative\" and said that \"there is not a lot of value\" in the work she touted. Under Whittaker, Google's AI Now Institute received funding from liberal donors, including the Ford and Omidyar Foundations. In her performance review, Whittaker highlighted her work on the institute as her major contribution at Google, prompting a manager to comment, \"This isn't her job at Google.\" Whittaker made her priorities clear in a 2019 blog post that announced her departure from Google, in which she noted her commitment to \"organizing for an accountable tech industry.\" Whittaker has a history of controversial statements. In 2019, she called Heritage Foundation president Kay Coles James an \"outspoken bigot\" after Google named James to its artificial intelligence advisory board. Whittaker in her attacks on James said the idea of viewpoint diversity is a rhetorical tool of the alt-right. She has called the gender gap in the artificial intelligence industry \"an emergency\" and called on Google to fire an employee who suggested that innate sex differences might contribute to the gap. Whittaker has also attacked white women who voted for former president Donald Trump and called out women in \"positions of patriarchal power.\" Whittaker's appointment will likely open another front in the battle over the FTC's role. Republicans in Congress who think tech companies are a threat are divided over whether to trust the FTC with more power. Republican senators Josh Hawley (Mo.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa), and Tom Cotton (Ark.) have all cosponsored bills that would give the FTC more power to go after tech companies. Other lawmakers, including Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), have slammed the Biden FTC for political \"abuses.\" Whittaker did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Videos from last week's Microsoft Ignite conference show employees reciting \"visual descriptions,\" which are meant to make blind audience members aware of presenters' biases. In one video, program manager Allison Weins opened her remarks by saying she was \"an Asian and white female, with dark brown hair.\" In a blog post released after the conference, Microsoft notes that it does not require its presenters to provide visual descriptions but recommends mentioning \"distinguishing characteristics like hair color, race/ethnicity, gender, clothing, and background details to avoid unconscious bias.\" The presenters at Microsoft\u2019s conference all highlighted their race, preferred gender pronouns, and outfits. One of the presenters who used visual descriptions, Nic Fillingham, directed the Washington Free Beacon to a video explanation of visual descriptions in which an activist explains the practice is \"intersectional\" and that visual descriptions \"help fight racism, sexism, and classism.\" Fillingham introduced himself by saying, \"I\u2019m a Caucasian man with glasses and a beard, I go by he/him, and I\u2019m a security evangelist here at Microsoft.\" Neither Microsoft nor its PR firm responded to requests for comment. In her opening remarks, Weins also noted that Microsoft wanted \"to acknowledge that the land where the Microsoft campus is situated was traditionally occupied by the Sammamish, the Duwamish, the Snoqualmie, the Suquamish, the Muckleshoot, the Snohomish, the Tulalip, and other Coast Salish peoples since time immemorial. A people that are still here, continuing to honor and bring to light their ancient heritage.\" \"Land acknowledgments\" have come into vogue in recent years in social justice circles. According to the Portland, Ore., City Council, which carries out a \"land acknowledgment\" before every meeting, the practice can help \"make amends\" for centuries of colonialism. Microsoft frequently highlights its work with Native Americans, including hiring a Native American contractor for a day to help design a Native American video game character. Microsoft has not announced plans to return land it owns to indigenous peoples. The town of Sammamish, the ancestral home of the Sammamish people where a major Microsoft campus is located, reported the highest median income of all cities in America in 2019.

Vladimir Osechkin is the founder of Gulagu.net, a watchdog site that last month rose to prominence after it posted thousands of photos and videos that show Russian security forces torturing and raping prisoners. Late Monday night, visitors to Osechkin's account saw a notice saying, \"This content isn't available right now. When this happens, it's usually because the owner only shared it with a small group of people, changed who can see it or it's been deleted.\" But Gulagu.net said Osechkin had not changed the settings on his page and that the removal was \"another attempt by the Russian special services to destroy Gulagu.net and Vladimir Osechkin personally.\" Gulagu.net had posted a new trove of graphic videos before the account was removed. The page had been restored without explanation by Tuesday afternoon. Facebook did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the issue. But Russia has escalated its pressure on social media companies to punish political dissidents, fining Facebook and the messaging app Telegram in June for not removing \"banned content.\" The removal of Osechkin's page also fits a pattern for Facebook. The company often deletes high-profile deleted pages and restores them after users publicly complain, saying the removal was an error. Russian officials have launched investigations into the leaked videos. But the Russian interior ministry also placed the man who leaked the videos on a wanted list. Sergei Savelyev, who obtained the videos while working as an inmate on the prison's computer system, says Russian security threatened to kill him if he did not denounce Gulagu.net. Savelyev is seeking political asylum in France. Gulagu.net alleges that the videos, which were recorded by prison officials, are used as blackmail against prisoners after they are released. Since posting the videos, Gulagu.net has been targeted with cyber attacks designed to shut down the site. Facebook says it always alerts users when their accounts or posts are removed. But Gulagu.net said in a statement that Osechkin received no such warning: \"No warnings, no complaints, there's simply no such account and that's it.\" Published under: Big Tech , Facebook , Prison , Russia , Social Media Facebook Deletes Account of Russian Activist Who Exposed Prison Abuse Vladimir Osechkin's account was restored Tuesday after public outcry MacKenzie Scott Sends Millions to Terror-Tied Nonprofit Network Bring in More Prosecutors: Finally Ending Minnesota\u2019s \u2018Never-Ending\u2019 Somali Fraud Schemes Requires Reinforcements Take My Governor\u2014Please Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Prepared To Flee to Moscow if Regime Loses Control Walz Drops Reelection Bid as Minnesota Reels From Massive Welfare Fraud Facebook Deletes Account of Russian Activist Who Exposed Prison Abuse Politics Trump Resolves the Maduro Problem The Foreign Policy Winners and Losers of 2025 As Europe Steps Back, Asia Steps Up Newsletters Morning Beacon A Russian penal colony (photo by Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images)"

Both Twitter and Facebook scaled back human reviews of content in the early days of the pandemic. The companies employ contractors to sift through material that may break their sites' rules, and said many contractors could not do that work from home. Two years on, both companies blame the effects of COVID-19 for erroneous content removal and the suspension of users' ability to appeal the censorship of their content. Both social media giants have increased content restrictions throughout the pandemic, even while claiming they can't adequately review removals. Twitter and Facebook rolled out new initiatives to ban or hide speech that suggested COVID-19 came from a Wuhan lab, although that theory has gained traction in the scientific community. Twitter regularly suspends politicians and other users who question vaccine mandates. Both Twitter and Facebook switched to remote work in March 2020. Twitter said at the time it would rely on \"machine learning and automation\" to \"take a wide range of actions on potentially abusive and manipulative content,\" and acknowledged that this change would lead to more mistakes and incorrect penalties for users. Although Twitter previously said the increased use of automated systems was a temporary move during the pandemic, a Twitter spokeswoman told the Washington Free Beacon the company would continue to \"utilize machine learning\" to enforce Twitter rules. The spokeswoman did not say whether Twitter would increase human review. Facebook says pandemic staffing problems caused them to suspend many users' ability to appeal content removals. The company says it lacks the bandwidth to conduct such reviews, even if content was erroneously removed by an automated system. Instead, Facebook promises users that their complaints will serve as training data to help the automated systems perform better \"in the future.\" In response to a Free Beacon inquiry, a Facebook spokesman contradicted this policy, saying the company allows users to appeal takedowns of their content in \"the vast majority of cases.\" The spokesman also said Facebook was \"actively monitoring feedback to improve the accuracy of our enforcement efforts.\" Facebook did not respond to requests to provide data on the percentage of users who can appeal content removal. In a November 2020 report, Facebook said most of the content removal decisions it later reversed were made by automated systems, suggesting those systems are substantially more likely to punish behavior that doesn't violate Facebook's rules. Facebook does not publish data on the percentage of content that is successfully appealed. Institute for Free Speech president David Keating told the Free Beacon that social media platforms should restore an appeals process for removed posts. He also criticized platforms for having a different \"set of rules for powerful people,\" calling content moderation systems \"a black box\" for users. Facebook allows most workers to work from home full time, and Twitter plans to allow remote indefinitely. It is unclear when the contracted content moderators Twitter and Facebook employed will return to regular, in-office work.

We all do. And you are also a worker inside that factory.\" Although Arriving Today doesn\u2019t quite end up making that argument, it paints a compelling picture of the elephantine supply chain that delivers products to our doorsteps. Needless to say, its publication is timely. Mims, who by day is a columnist at the Wall Street Journal , maintains a healthy skepticism of the supply chain\u2019s mechanization, and the ways in which the interchangeability of the system\u2019s components have made jobs in the industry more punishing and alienating. His chapter on the cargo ship sailors who were trapped at sea for the better part of a year during COVID is especially eye-opening. But he balances skepticism with an infectious awe at the scale of the system. \"90 percent of the world\u2019s goods travel by ship,\" he explains, and as those ships cross the Pacific they sit \"1.2 miles higher above the surface of Earth than the peak of Mt. Everest.\" Similar factoids dot the text, along with insights into the human-machine melding required to make the system work. Mims describes a ship as \"a giant suit worn by its humans\"; at another point, he rides along as a harbor pilot takes \"total command of the largest mobile, man-made object on Earth,\" guiding it into its port resting place with inches to spare. But Arriving Today also manages to capture the quirky, inefficient, and deeply human parts of the supply chain. As containers full of goods arrive in the Los Angeles port, they\u2019re unloaded onto land by massive cranes, and then spend several days being \"groomed,\" or shuffled around into more accessible stacks, by smaller cranes. After a local trucker transports the container to another distribution center, the goods are unpacked and enter America\u2019s long-distance trucking ecosystem. This world is riddled with strange structural inefficiencies: Despite being essential and in high demand, truckers are worked to the bone and paid little. Barely one-third of the 10 million Americans with a commercial driver\u2019s license are working as truckers, a sign of the industry\u2019s high turnover. Mims leads readers through the neon world of roadside truck stops and ably describes the murky regulations meant to protect truckers that indirectly endanger them. Logging devices, introduced to track hours and stop truckers from driving sleepy, end up increasing speeding from drivers without affecting the number of total crashes. Although trucking is a messy business, things change dramatically when we arrive at Amazon\u2019s warehouses. Over the course of the pandemic, Amazon increased its \"frontline workforce\" by half, crossing the million-employee mark before Mims\u2019s eyes. The author describes the \"fundamental Darwinian\" workplace culture, where warehouse employees are constantly surveilled and compared with their compatriots. Mims argues that this system of \"stack ranking\" contributes to the high rates of injury (in some warehouses, four times higher than the industry average). Arriving Today is at its most winsome when Mims attempts to perform the physical exertions of warehouse and delivery workers and finds that \"industrial athletes\" display levels of strength, agility, and endurance far beyond the typical office worker\u2019s capacity. Mims got lucky with his timing: His narrative, starting with a tour of Vietnamese ports, begins right as COVID breaks out in China in 2020. As a result, he gets to interweave the usual workings of the supply chain with the distended turmoil of the pandemic. Mims is an able chronicler of the changes and keeps one eye on the broader historical context. \"What America\u2019s Rust Belt once was, that swath of productive enterprise stretching from Baltimore to the Great Lakes, places like Vietnam have become\u2014only for the whole world.\" If Arriving Today merits a complaint, it\u2019s that it\u2019s not long enough, and thus misses the chance to break down the world of policy around global shipping and trade. He hints at a number of fascinating rabbit holes without leading us down them: For instance, that the 11 major shipping companies are really just three \"ocean alliances\" that each share ships and containers internally. The timespan covered in the book ends just before the Long Beach bottlenecks that made national news. There are a couple points where Arriving Today breaks down: Hitler and FDR are included in a list of \"people whom history has mostly forgotten,\" while crossing the Pacific is \"a study in contrasts.\" Mostly, though, Mims keeps his prose tight and focused on the people who knit the world of goods together: the Filipino and Ukrainian sailors flying Panamanian flags, weary American truckers, and Amazon warehouse workers ground down by \"despotic Taylorism.\" Those human cogs in the great machine enable a level of consumer convenience unthinkable to our ancestors. Mims leaves it to the reader to judge whether that convenience is worth the cost.

The survey from the Media Research Center found 49 percent of respondents said it was inappropriate for social media sites to suppress an October 2020 New York Post report that showed Hunter promised Ukrainian business partners access to his father. Twitter suspended the Post ' s account following publication and blocked users from sharing the link. Fifty-two percent of respondents said the blackout constituted election interference. Big tech has come under fire over the past year for censoring posts on hot-button issues. Facebook has regularly removed or suppressed content that suggests COVID-19 escaped from a Chinese lab. The platform also removed posts from a Gold Star mother critical of Biden's handling of the death of her son. Twitter this month suspended the account of Rep. Jim Banks (R., Ind.) after he referred to a transgender Biden official as a man. The Media Research Center survey found that the ban on the Hunter Biden story also shaped voters' perceptions of Joe Biden. Almost 30 percent of respondents said they would have been less likely to vote for Biden if they had been aware of evidence Biden lied about \"knowledge of his son Hunter's overseas business dealings.\" When the story first broke, media outlets labeled it Russian disinformation, even though there was no evidence that Russian agents were behind the story or that the emails had been falsified. The survey found that line has stuck with many voters, with 30 percent still saying the story was Russian disinformation. Dan Gainor, a vice president at the Media Research Center, said the survey showed \"people are finally catching on to how much we're getting manipulated by big tech.\" He framed the survey results as a reflection of widespread concerns about self-rule, asking the Washington Free Beacon , \"How can democratically elected countries survive if big tech decides it wants to pick who wins the election?\" Published under: Big Tech , Censorship , Hunter Biden , Joe Biden , Laptop , Ukraine Poll: Majority of Americans Say Big Tech Censorship of Hunter Laptop Story Interfered With Election MacKenzie Scott Sends Millions to Terror-Tied Nonprofit Network Bring in More Prosecutors: Finally Ending Minnesota\u2019s \u2018Never-Ending\u2019 Somali Fraud Schemes Requires Reinforcements Take My Governor\u2014Please Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Prepared To Flee to Moscow if Regime Loses Control Walz Drops Reelection Bid as Minnesota Reels From Massive Welfare Fraud Poll: Majority of Americans Say Big Tech Censorship of Hunter Laptop Story Interfered With Election Politics Trump Resolves the Maduro Problem The Foreign Policy Winners and Losers of 2025 As Europe Steps Back, Asia Steps Up Newsletters Morning Beacon"

The Wall Street Journal , Wired , Reuters, and Politico have all published news-style pieces commissioned by the Chinese telecom giant to advance its interests, according to a Washington Free Beacon review. Since July, Reuters has published two sponsored articles touting Huawei's investments in the United Kingdom. The Journal has published 14 sponsored articles since last year, while Wired has hosted virtual events sponsored by the tech giant. Politico ran pro-Huawei content last year. The articles disclose that Huawei sponsors the content, though the company's ties to the Chinese government may not be apparent to readers. Huawei has come under fire for its cozy relationship with Beijing. Critics of Huawei, whose founder is an avowed member of the Chinese Communist Party, say the company's links to the Chinese government pose risks to dissenters in China and could help the regime spy on foreign adversaries. The Trump administration put Huawei on an economic blacklist over those concerns, and the Biden administration has maintained the policy. Huawei has spent millions of dollars on advertising and lobbying to beat back the sanctions and to rehabilitate its image. The company has paid Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta $500,000 since August to lobby the White House, according to lobbying disclosures . Media companies that partner with Huawei and other Chinese entities have drawn scrutiny in recent years as Beijing has mounted an aggressive foreign propaganda campaign. The Journal , New York Times , and Washington Post all ended partnerships with China Daily last year, citing concerns about working with state-run media outlets. The National Association of Black Journalists last year canceled an online event to discuss misinformation regarding coronavirus after backlash over Huawei's sponsorship. Huawei has sponsored events through Wired 's \"Brand Lab,\" which offers the magazine's clients \"the chance to connect your brand to the Wired world.\" Huawei sponsored a conversation with Brookings Institution fellow Dr. Nicol Turner Lee, whose think tank has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Huawei. That funding from Huawei has bought friendly write-ups of Huawei projects. The Brand Lab also has created friendly, unsigned opinion pieces on behalf of Huawei. In one , Wired argues that although \"computer chips make the digital world go round,\" the United States risks \"decoupling supply chains\" and \"dramatically impacting the bottom lines of businesses.\" The piece blames the United States for pressuring Huawei and makes no reference to national security concerns. Wired 's news coverage of Huawei has often included defenses of the company and warnings that an \" ill-considered \" crackdown \"could spell the end of a single, global internet\" and could \" backfire .\" The Journal has churned out 14 articles since August 2020 as part of the Huawei sponsorship. The articles, which the Journal posts to one of the company's Twitter accounts, feature headlines like \"Why AI Needs More Women,\" \"Conservation Through Connectivity,\" and \"Creating a Culture of Trust.\" The material offers a positive view of technology companies and 5G technology, with some of the articles portraying Huawei as a force for social good. A sponsored article promoted in August says that Huawei technology can bring an end to so-called digital deserts by \"promoting digital inclusion and connecting the disconnected around the world.\" The article also quotes Afke Schaart, a former Dutch lawmaker who serves as Huawei's senior vice president for global government affairs. Reuters's content is directed at the United Kingdom, which has banned Huawei's equipment from being used on its high-speed wireless infrastructure. One article claimed that Huawei's 5G will drive economic recovery for small- and medium-sized businesses. A Reuters piece published this month touted Huawei's commitment to the conservation movement. The article quoted a Huawei executive saying that the company's technology would \"help protect the planet\" and that Huawei is \"committed to supporting conservation projects in many ecosystems, including oceans, rainforests, and mountains.\" A spokesman for the Journal declined to comment for this story. Reuters and Wired did not respond to requests for comment. Huawei also did not respond to emails seeking comment.

During a Senate Commerce Committee hearing, TikTok head of U.S. public policy Michael Beckerman dodged repeated questions from Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) on how the social media company's close ties to Beijing affect American users. According to TikTok's privacy policy , the company can share all user data with its \"corporate affiliates.\" Beckerman refused to say whether those affiliates include Beijing ByteDance Technology, a TikTok sister company whose board includes at least one Chinese Communist Party official. Although TikTok denies it is controlled by Chinese entities, it has heavily censored content critical of the Chinese Communist Party, including videos that highlighted Hong Kong pro-democracy protests or mentioned the Tiananmen Square massacre. After those censorship standards were published in 2019 by The Guardian , TikTok announced it was changing its policies to allow more free expression. TikTok parent company ByteDance is based in China, which requires companies to hand over any data the government demands for national security reasons. Beckerman also denied that TikTok had censored content critical of the Chinese government's mass imprisonment of Uyghurs, an ethnic minority in China's Xinjiang province. Beckerman's British counterpart admitted last year, however, that \"there were some incidents where content was not allowed on the platform, specifically with regard to the Uighur situation.\" That executive later recanted. Cruz said that Beckerman \"dodged the questions more than any witness I have seen.\" Beckerman said the senator was peppering him with \"gotcha questions.\" Other senators pointed out that TikTok's privacy policy requires users to agree to having their biometric data collected. ByteDance agreed this month to pay $92 million to American users whose biometric data it shared with third parties. TikTok also settled with the Federal Trade Commission for illegally harvesting data from children and was found to be collecting data on Google phones without the permission of users.

At issue are demands made by Google that would change how Roku operates. The demands include a dedicated section of search results for YouTube\u2014something no other Roku partner receives. Roku tells users searching for a movie where to watch it based on their streaming subscriptions; Google is pushing for some searches to route directly to YouTube, even if it means consumers would pay more. And Google wants Roku to provide the valuable search data it receives from users, a demand Roku calls a fundamental threat to business. Rep. Ken Buck (R., Colo.) called the fight \"the latest example of Google's take-no-prisoners business model.\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) said the fight \"highlights why we need new laws to prevent dominant digital platforms from abusing their power.\" Removing YouTube from Roku would directly entangle consumers in what has so far been an internal contract dispute. Google has come under fire for what critics say is a monopoly over online search. YouTube is the second-most used search engine in the world, behind Google Search itself, with one in four people on Earth using it. Roku says its fight against Google is not just a corporate spat, but another example of powerful tech monopolists manipulating the market in their favor. State attorneys general have brought two lawsuits against Google, and legislation debated on the Hill would bar Google from self-preferencing its own products in search results and potentially even lead to the company's breakup. Google's demand to access Roku's data on user search is direct pressure on a smaller competitor, as Roku and Google both compete for digital advertising spending and Google's Chromecast competes with the TV platform. But Roku said the fight was not about money: \"We have not asked for a single change in the financial terms of our existing agreement.\" Google said in April that it never \"made any requests to access user data or interfere with search results.\" But an email shared with the Washington Free Beacon shows that a senior Google executive called a dedicated \"shelf\" for YouTube search results \"a must\" for the company.

Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) / Getty Images Santi Ruiz October 21, 2021 image/svg+xml A leading Republican critic of Big Tech is criticizing the Facebook whistleblower for policy prescriptions that could lead to increased censorship of conservatives. Senator Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.) earlier this month invited former Facebook employee Frances Haugen to testify on a trove of documents that show Facebook knows it causes harm to children, especially teen girls. But in a statement to the Washington Free Beacon, Blackburn says Haugen has gone too far with her policy recommendations , including her call for creating a federal agency to monitor social media companies. \"These documents invoke stunning allegations regarding Facebook's failure to act despite knowing that their platform harms children,\" she said. \"While I will take any opportunity to gain insight into how Facebook functions, I will not endorse policy recommendations that, among other things, would make it easier for big tech companies to silence conservatives.\" Haugen, formerly a member of Facebook's civic integrity team, also suggested that social media companies manipulate their feeds in order to slow the spread of \"misinformation.\" Conservatives have criticized Facebook and other social media companies for unfairly moderating content in ways that censor them. By contrast, Democrats have endorsed calls for further policing \"disinformation\" by requiring social media companies to crack down on more speech. Some of Haugen's recommendations have received support from both sides of the aisle. She urged Facebook to share more of its research publicly and to offer users the option of a chronological News Feed. But Haugen also called for a special government bureau to oversee social media platforms, describing it as \"a regulatory home where someone like me could do a tour of duty after working at a place like this.\" Haugen endorsed \"soft interventions\" by Facebook, such as reducing how often something shows up in the News Feed, to slow down the virality of \"misinformation\" on the platform. And she encouraged lawmakers to investigate ways to police the algorithms that tech companies use to decide which content to promote. Conservatives have expressed concern over the network of Democratic operatives closely involved in Haugen's public relations strategy. Liberal billionaire Pierre Omidyar has supported Haugen through his philanthropic organization Luminate. The eBay founder also funds the nonprofit that represents Haugen legally. Haugen, whose PR representative is former Obama spokesman Bill Burton, is also being advised by former Democratic presidential candidate and Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig. Facebook expects more internal documents to be released to the media this weekend. Facebook's public relations account on Monday tweeted a thread that warned readers \"a curated selection out of millions of documents can in no way be used to draw fair conclusions about us.\" Facebook has attempted to undermine Haugen's testimony, attacking her for leaking \"stolen documents\" and noting that she \"worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, [and] never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives.\" In the last three months, Facebook has spent $5 million lobbying Congress.

Commissioner Brendan Carr said the FCC should begin the process of adding DJI to the agency's \"Covered List,\" which would bar federal entities from purchasing the Shenzhen-based company's drones. Carr noted several intelligence reports warning Chinese government actors may have access to video footage and software data recorded by those drones. DJI supplies 50 percent of drones purchased in the United States, including drones recently purchased by the FBI and Secret Service. Carr's comments mark the latest push by China hawks to cut Chinese manufacturers out of critical sectors of the economy. Lawmakers including Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) have called for strict bans on federal use of Chinese technology, citing concerns that Chinese intelligence may have access to data. China's 2017 National Intelligence Law allows Communist Party officials to access any data held by Chinese companies. Several federal agencies banned the use of DJI drones following a 2017 Department of Homeland Security report that found the company likely provides sensitive U.S. data to the Chinese government. The 2020 National Defense Authorization Act largely barred the Department of Defense from purchasing the drones, and the Department of the Interior grounded its fleet last year over security concerns. A Carr staffer said the FCC is already required by law to add companies to its Covered List if national security agencies determine they pose a national security risk. In comments to the Washington Free Beacon , Carr called on the FCC to work more closely with national security agencies. Last year, the Department of Commerce added DJI to its \"Entity List,\" meaning special licenses are required for the import of DJI products. The department said DJI was added for having \"enabled wide-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-technology surveillance, and/or facilitated the export of items by China that aid repressive regimes around the world, contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests.\" The FCC could soon bar companies on the Covered List from operating in the United States regardless of whether federal dollars are involved. Five Chinese companies, including telecommunications giant Huawei, are already on the FCC's Covered List. \"We do not need an airborne version of Huawei,\" Carr said.

Part of a bipartisan legislative package, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act would prohibit Amazon from promoting its own versions of products over other, similar products available on its platform. But in emails to third-party sellers, Amazon claims the legislation would make it impossible to sustain a marketplace, essentially threatening to boot hundreds of thousands of sellers from the platform. The company requests sellers sign up for email updates that will give them \"opportunities to communicate directly\" with lawmakers. Amazon has a rocky relationship with its third-party sellers. In February, Orthodox Jewish sellers objected to new rules that would force them to ship products on the Sabbath. Amazon ignored their complaints and pressed through with the changes, forcing some sellers off the platform entirely. Internal documents show Amazon copies third-party products and rigs search results to promote their versions. In an email to sellers, Amazon claimed the legislation \"would jeopardize Amazon's ability to operate a marketplace for sellers, potentially resulting in hundreds of thousands of American small and medium-sized businesses losing access to Amazon\u2019s customers and services.\" More than 60 percent of products on Amazon are sold by third parties. It is unclear why Amazon says a move to protect third-party sellers would actually destroy their businesses. The Online Merchants Guild said Amazon's communications were intended to send \"an immediate chill throughout the online community.\" Rep. Ken Buck (R., Colo.), one of the bill\u2019s cosponsors, told the Washington Free Beacon that the legislation \"would not mandate that Amazon kick small businesses off their platform,\" and would curtail \"anticompetitive behavior.\" Buck called Amazon's attempt to lobby third-party sellers \"a gaslight campaign.\" Rep. David Cicilline (D., R.I.), the other main House cosponsor, accused Amazon of \"conducting a scorched-earth campaign against its own sellers.\" Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), who cosponsored a similar bill in the Senate, told the Free Beacon that claims the bill would hurt third parties were \"simply self-serving hogwash.\" The American Innovation and Choice Online Act is part of a broader legislative package designed to curtail the power of big tech companies. The package would also bar dominant companies from buying off their smaller rivals and allow users of some social media platforms to take their data to other platforms.

Instead, the Microsoft-owned company will launch a site where users cannot freely communicate. The new platform, InJobs, will launch later this year and will not contain any social media features. Users will not be allowed to share posts or articles. The move comes as China demands increased censorship from social media companies as part of an effort to control the nation's tech sector. LinkedIn, which has a history of cooperating with the Chinese Communist Party, is \"facing a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China,\" according to a statement on its corporate blog. LinkedIn and its parent company Microsoft have regularly complied with the Chinese Communist Party in order to do business in the country. LinkedIn, the only U.S. social network operating in China, shut down the Chinese accounts users who criticized the regime or used forbidden phrases like \"Tiananmen Square.\" In September, Axios reporter Beth Allen-Ebrahimian said her account had been censored in China, along with those of other China researchers and reporters. In March, LinkedIn announced it would be pausing sign-ups indefinitely in China to \"remain in compliance with local law.\" Regulators had demanded the company enact stricter speech restrictions within 30 days. LinkedIn executives were required to perform a \"self-evaluation\" for China\u2019s internet regulatory body. LinkedIn alluded to its troubles with censorship in its statement. \"While we've found success in helping Chinese members find jobs and economic opportunity, we have not found that same level of success in the more social aspects of sharing and staying informed.\" LinkedIn has also allowed Chinese firms to buy a partial stake in its Chinese platform. Microsoft has worked closely with the Chinese Communist Party, even after China hacked hundreds of thousands of Microsoft email servers in March 2021. Microsoft CEO Brad Smith last month met with a top regulator at China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to discuss expanding his work in China. Smith also defended Chinese company Huawei from criticism. And LinkedIn has expanded the data centers that support its facial recognition tools in China. Even as his company deepens its ties with China, Microsoft\u2019s top scientist this year reported to Congress that \"China's domestic use of AI is a chilling precedent for anyone around the world who cherishes individual liberty.\" When it first launched in China in 2014, LinkedIn promised that it \"will be transparent about how it conducts business in China and will use multiple avenues to notify members about our practices.\" Published under: Big Tech , CCP , Censorship , China , microsoft LinkedIn Kowtows to Communist China by Creating Spin-Off That Will Stifle Speech The Microsoft-owned company has a history of cooperating with Chinese officials MacKenzie Scott Sends Millions to Terror-Tied Nonprofit Network Bring in More Prosecutors: Finally Ending Minnesota\u2019s \u2018Never-Ending\u2019 Somali Fraud Schemes Requires Reinforcements Take My Governor\u2014Please Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Prepared To Flee to Moscow if Regime Loses Control Walz Drops Reelection Bid as Minnesota Reels From Massive Welfare Fraud LinkedIn Kowtows to Communist China by Creating Spin-Off That Will Stifle Speech Politics Trump Resolves the Maduro Problem The Foreign Policy Winners and Losers of 2025 As Europe Steps Back, Asia Steps Up Newsletters Morning Beacon Bill Gates, Li Keqiang (Thomas Peter/AFP via Getty Images)"

The streaming service originally gave no explanation for suspending the American Principles Project (APP), a group largely focused on public education reform. According to the group's president, Terry Schilling, YouTube said only that APP had committed \"severe and repeated violations\" of YouTube's community guidelines. In a statement provided to the Washington Free Beacon , Schilling speculated that APP had been banned \"because we support Big Tech reform and have opposed Google's previous efforts to censor conservative speech.\" After a Free Beacon inquiry, YouTube said APP was banned for resharing videos from a banned account, that of former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. YouTube did not explain why it permanently banned Bannon's account in January. YouTube told the Free Beacon that it reinstated APP's channel and issued a warning, the latest instance of a social media company banning and then reinstating accounts following outside pressure. As of this writing, however, an APP spokesperson said the organization's account still has limited functionality. Days before YouTube banned APP, the group came under fire from Democratic Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe. McAuliffe's campaign on Sunday sent a fundraising email that called APP a \"shadowy organization\" that has \"launched a barrage of attacks against\" McAuliffe. APP is the latest conservative organization suspended without explanation from major social media platforms. YouTube last week \"permanently suspended\" the account of Joe Kent (R.), a Washington state candidate for the House of Representatives. After the story was picked up by conservative outlets , YouTube reinstated the channel while maintaining that \"we enforce our policies equally for everyone.\" APP director of policy Jon Schweppe said he received the suspension email at 6:30 AM with no prior warning. Following the suspension, APP was not able to access or download content it had posted to its YouTube page. Schilling said he is considering legal action against YouTube. YouTube says it maintains a three-strikes policy, but it did not apply that policy in APP's case. APP largely focuses on public school issues but has criticized big tech for restricting free speech and allowing children to access pornography and other obscene material. It lobbied against Section 230, the federal law that protects social media platforms from being held liable for speech hosted on their sites. Google's original lack of explanation for the permanent ban could spur more calls for transparency in how big tech companies apply their content moderation rules. Scholars from across the political spectrum have called for federal rules on transparency that would require major social media companies to explain bans, suspensions, and other enforcement actions.

Built by a young Stanford savant, the app uses an automated chatbot to help users contest parking tickets. So far, so good? Not for the authors of System Error , a tome of \"provocative insights and concrete solutions\" for the most important tech problems of our day. DoNotPay is \"exactly the type of story that gives us pause,\" the authors tell us: Parking tickets serve \"important, legitimate purposes.\" What if too many citizens successfully contest their tickets and infrastructure revenue collapses? In fact, it's a lesson in the unintended consequences of technology. It's also an odd grievance for a book that's ostensibly about the importance of liberal democracy for containing tech excesses. DoNotPay empowers citizens, not major tech corporations, and improves on an opaque, often infuriating process. The authors don't argue that parking ticket laws should be enforced fairly and efficiently\u2014rather, they blame the technologists for exposing those ticket laws. This pattern continues throughout the book. Often its authors' criticisms of Silicon Valley and concentrated power are spot-on, but they can't come up with coherent responses and refuse to apply the same critical lens to government actors. The problem with tech, authors Rob Reich, Mehran Sahami, and Jeremy M. Weinstein allege, is a culture of optimization. This culture springs from the actual problems that programmers and engineers are solving algorithmically. Spend all day teaching computers to find more efficient solutions to problems, and eventually one thinks in those terms too, without regard to values or unintended consequences. It's not a new insight, but it's a useful reminder of how culture and shared language can shape the way we approach problems. Although tech is a dangerous world, the authors tell us, government regulation is not. \"Regulation is just a loaded word for an important thing: the actions taken by those we elect to transform our shared values into rules that serve the common interest.\" It's frustrating, then, that the authors fail to consider that the same mindless optimization can also afflict the very regulators they believe can solve big tech issues. One of the heroes of System Error is Lorena Gonzalez (D.), a California assemblywoman who pushed for legislation to rearrange gig working classifications for drivers at Lyft and Uber. Reasonable minds can disagree on the merits of the move, but Gonzalez cheered the firings of 200 workers from jobs she decided were \"never good\" and completely invented statistics to support the bill. All this, despite mass outcry from the gig workers who were affected by the law. What is this if not mindless optimization? In some ways, System Error makes the same rhetorical move about government that technologists make about their technology. Both invoke democracy and mass support to cover up rule by experts: System Error simply wants those experts to be government bureaucrats, not Silicon Valley content moderators. The sections on algorithmic bias and automation are decent overviews of current debates, although the authors struggle to outline clear policy proposals. Faced with 21 distinct definitions of fairness , the authors conclude: \"We must pay attention to what fairness means in particular social contexts.\" What this means in practice is left unsaid. But it's the section on speech online that is predictably terrible, as the authors push eagerly for more speech censorship from the tech overlords. \"Even if our worst fears are not borne out by the data,\" they say, we should still censor disinformation far more aggressively. They draw a line between hate speech and \"genuine creativity and expression\" and suggest that line should be easy to police. Among the policy proposals: \"dedicated anti-trolling laws to police mob-style attacks on journalists\" and \"reducing virality\" of posts that don't satisfy an internal fact-checker. Governments must \"balance the importance of free expression against other essential goals.\" Of course, one of the loveliest features of American democracy is precisely that free expression is not the government's to police, outside of strict bounds. One would hope a book about the future of our democracy would recognize that truth. System Error is a useful primer for understanding political questions over tech. Just don't expect it to provide many answers. System Error: Where Big Tech Went Wrong and How We Can Reboot by Rob Reich, Mehran Sahami, and Jeremy M.

At least two China-backed hackers breached Afghan telecommunications giant Roshan earlier this year, according to a report from the Insikt Group, a cybersecurity research firm. Hacking groups ramped up their efforts in August and September, as U.S. troops began leaving the country. The breach could give China access to \"hugely valuable\" information about the network itself and high-value individuals who use it, the researchers said. Afghanistan is the latest country where China has tried to expand its influence. In the United States, China has successfully pressured Nike, Apple, and the NBA to remain silent on Chinese human-rights abuses. Lithuanian government officials last month warned citizens not to buy Chinese phones after they were found to contain censorship tools. In Asia, China has used \"debt-trap diplomacy,\" loaning money to smaller countries at devastating interest rates and seizing assets when those debts are not repaid. China has spent $50 to 100 billion a year on its Belt and Road initiative, which uses infrastructure projects to expand its influence in developing countries. But Afghanistan is an unlikely target for Belt and Road projects, given its remoteness, poverty, and instability. According to Center for Strategic and International Studies senior fellow Jonathan Hillman, China may see digital attacks as a more effective route to gaining a foothold in Afghanistan. \"The Chinese government may view Afghanistan's major telecom providers as an important avenue for collecting intelligence and monitoring political and security risks,\" Hillman told the Washington Free Beacon. Such operations could help China monitor activity near Afghanistan\u2019s border with the Xinjiang region, where the country maintains a network of concentration camps for its Uyghur ethnic minority. The Taliban has removed Uyghur militia fighters from the border, apparently as a favor to the Chinese government. Afghan Uyghurs worry they may be deported to China as the Taliban cements its control. The researchers noted that China\u2019s intelligence apparatus is so large that the hacking groups likely did not coordinate with each other, suggesting there may have been multiple intelligence targets in the hack. One of the Chinese hacking groups was implicated in the March hack of Microsoft Exchange, accessing the emails of hundreds of thousands of Americans.

Under the new policy, video creators will not receive a cut of revenue from views of those videos. The move is one of the most sweeping policy changes from a big tech company regarding what content is allowed or encouraged on the platform. Google says the change was driven by advertisers and video creators who \"simply don\u2019t want\" their content to appear next to ads or videos that contain \"climate change denial.\" But Google also said the policy is a bid \"to better protect users from unreliable claims.\" The company said the new policy will \"strengthen the integrity of our advertising ecosystem.\" Google said it would use both human reviewers and artificial intelligence to enforce the policy.

(Photo by Matt McClain-Pool/Getty Images) Santi Ruiz October 5, 2021 image/svg+xml Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen called for increased regulation of social media Tuesday, telling senators that the company \"cannot adequately identify dangerous content.\" Speaking to the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, Haugen called for reforming Section 230, a federal law that protects social media companies from liability for user content. Haugen, who leaked a trove of internal Facebook documents to the Wall Street Journal, said eliminating those protections would \"make Facebook responsible for the consequences of its [content moderation strategies].\" Her testimony is the latest public setback Facebook has suffered in recent weeks. CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost $7 billion in a single day after Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp simultaneously crashed on Monday. Since the Journal began reporting on documents leaked by Haugen, lawmakers have slammed Facebook for suppressing research that showed its products are harmful for children. Haugen testified that Facebook is incentivized to make \"children establish habits before they have good self regulation.\" She cited a document showing problematic use of Facebook peaked at 14 years old, and that kids explicitly say they feel bad when they use Instagram but can\u2019t stop. Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah) presented ads Facebook had approved but never run that encouraged kids to take prescription drugs at parties and practice anorexic behaviors. The Tech Transparency Project, a tech accountability nonprofit, submitted the ads to test Facebook's ad-approval process. Facebook representatives attacked Haugen on Twitter, saying she \"worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, [and] never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives.\" They also said Haugen did not directly work on child safety issues while at Facebook. They did not attempt to rebut the documents Haugen accessed that show the platform's harm to children. Speaking to Congress last week, Facebook executive Antigone Davis claimed the company does not actively market to kids. But internal memos show Facebook is working to attract children and teens as the platform\u2019s popularity wanes among young people. \u200b\u200bHaugen also said she was speaking to members of Congress about Facebook\u2019s knowledge that China, Iran, and other state actors were using the platform to surveil political opponents and other states. During the hearing, Haugen endorsed a number of Democratic proposals, including a bill from Sen. Ed Markey (D., Mass.) that would create governmental bodies to police algorithms. In an exchange with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), she said Facebook ignores misinformation on its platform in order to drive traffic. The Washington Free Beacon reported on Monday that Haugen is receiving strategic communications guidance from a top Democratic operative, former Obama administration deputy press secretary Bill Burton. Burton has called for stricter government regulation of content allowed on Facebook.

The company claims the crash, which occurred around noon, is the result of a server issue. But Facebook has not publicly said what caused the outage. Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said the company is \"working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible.\" The outage is so widespread that Facebook employees could not enter buildings , as their building passes are connected to a Facebook-run system. The crash comes at an inopportune time for Facebook. Last month, senators grilled Facebook executives following a Wall Street Journal report that the company suppressed evidence that its products harm children. On Sunday, the whistleblower who provided the Journal with internal documents told 60 Minutes that these revelations prove Facebook prioritizes profit over user safety. Rep. Ken Buck (R., Colo.), who has proposed bills that would break up Facebook into smaller entities, told the Washington Free Beacon the outage \"just goes to show why consumer options and healthy competition are critical to free market success.\" Buck also said it was \"convenient\" that Facebook went down during one of \"the biggest negative press days for Facebook in recent memory.\" The crash apparently resulted from a feature of the internet's routing system called Border Gateway Protocol. Cybersecurity researchers are unsure whether malicious actors caused the outage, although most Border Gateway Protocol issues are self-inflicted . But researcher Omer Shapira pointed out that China has used Border Gateway Protocol attacks in the past to route selective information through Chinese servers. The crash appears to have affected a number of Facebook-supported applications, including its popular corporate tool Facebook Workplace. According to one employee, the crash locked out Facebook staff from accessing servers remotely. Staffers physically present at the servers do not have authorization on those servers. Some observers suggest the outage proves Facebook is too large an entity and should be broken up. Big tech critic Mike Davis called Facebook \"perhaps the biggest single point of failure on the internet today\" and said \"we should not be this reliant on any one company.\" According to web traffic tracker Netblocks , the outage has already cost Facebook at least two-thirds of a billion dollars.

The reduction comes as Google faces an antitrust suit from 37 state attorneys general, who claim the tech company's control of its Android app store constitutes a monopoly. In July, Google slashed the cut it takes from app store sales from 30 to 15 percent. Google is one of several tech companies to reduce third-party fees in response to growing pressure from lawmakers and third-party app developers. After Epic Games sued Apple for banning its apps, the company cut its take of app purchases from 30 to 15 percent. In August, Microsoft reduced its cut from games sold on its Windows App Store from 30 percent to 12 percent. The Federal Trade Commission, which regulates anticompetitive behavior, has made policing online platforms a priority under President Joe Biden. A memo this month from FTC chairwoman Lina Khan emphasizes the importance of addressing the market power of digital platforms. The Senate is considering a bill that would make suits against app store platforms easier to pursue. App developers have long criticized tech giants for taking a substantial cut of sales within apps sold on their stores. The app store battles have highlighted the control major tech companies have over other companies\u2019 products and revenues they generate from sales within those apps. Apple said it has generated $100 million through its cut of sales from Epic Games\u2019 apps alone. A federal court ruled earlier this month that Apple had engaged in \"anticompetitive conduct\" and that its policies \"hide critical information from consumers and illegally stifle consumer choice.\" The court instructed Apple not to punish developers for directing consumers to other payment systems. Apple had described its commission fees as \"essential\" to the operations of its App Store and said the App Store would become \"a toxic kind of mess\" without them.

Geothermal technology harnesses energy from heat stored below Earth's crust. Proponents say it could meet a major share of U.S. energy needs within the decade. But green groups have quietly lobbied against geothermal solutions, saying they weaken federal environmental protection standards. Rep. Russ Fulcher (R., Idaho) and Sen. Jim Risch (R., Idaho) on Thursday introduced a bill that would make it easier for geothermal drilling projects to explore federal land. An earlier version of that bill was quietly shot down by Democrats. Sources say Democratic lawmakers privately supported the bill but feared their public support would lead to pushback from green groups. Geothermal systems convert subterranean heat into steam, which powers turbines. The energy produced by this process is essentially limitless, completely renewable and emits no carbon. The United States is the world leader in geothermal energy, even though the energy only accounts for half of 1 percent of U.S. electricity generation. This renewable energy solution is constrained by the absence of available land. Most accessible geothermal resources in the United States are on federal land in the West, including large swathes of Utah, Nevada, and Arizona. Unlike oil and gas firms, companies seeking to drill exploratory wells for geothermal energy on that land must undergo years of environmental review. Even though geothermal companies use the same drilling rigs as their oil and gas counterparts, they are held to a more difficult standard. Fulcher and Risch\u2019s bill would give geothermal drilling projects the same expedited reviews that oil and gas ventures already receive for public land. By creating a \"categorical exclusion\" from the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the bill would shave several years off the development time of geothermal wells and make the field more enticing to investors. Green activist groups have quietly lobbied against this plan. These groups oppose changes to NEPA, which requires a lengthy review process for proposed projects that would use public land. Activist groups worry that any exemptions to NEPA, even for clean energy sources, could undermine the rest of the law. The National Resource Defense Council did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did the Wilderness Society, which directed the Washington Free Beacon to a statement that expresses its opposition to changes to NEPA. Sierra Club senior attorney Nathaniel Shoaff told the Free Beacon that NEPA is \"an essential tool.\" Shoaff said that without the act, the public would be deprived of an opportunity to hear about the benefits of certain developments on public land. The Sierra Club generally opposes developing public land. Geothermal energy doesn't fit the narrative pushed by many green groups. Proponents don't call for more expansive federal regulation or oppose using low-risk fracking technologies. As a result, geothermal solutions have remained largely out of public view. And the small industry's limited lobbying efforts have yet to seriously move the needle in Washington. Even with the lethargy on Capitol Hill, though, geothermal energy is picking up steam. Proponents of geothermal energy believe minor technological breakthroughs could enable a revolution in American energy production. Some oil and gas veterans believe techniques in that field can make traditional geothermal drilling productive at scale, while others think fracking technology and 3D printing can be adapted to pull heat from rock too deep or too hard to reach with traditional geothermal methods. Geothermal energy is typically pulled from places directly over tectonic faults, where water is heated in cracks below the Earth's surface. Heat stored at deeper levels or in less accessible rock has often been expensive to tap, the reason geothermal energy has struggled to challenge wind and solar, let alone oil and gas, in the commercial market. Some companies think new technology can bring geothermal prices in line with, or even cheaper than, those of solar and wind. Oil companies began investing in geothermal projects in the early 2000s but largely dropped the projects to take advantage of the natural gas boom. Now, these companies are turning their attention to geothermal energy once again, this time with technologies adapted from fracking. Many companies expect to be acquired by oil companies looking to diversify their portfolios. Industry professionals are also bullish on the sector's ability to supply jobs for oil and gas workers as the country transitions away from fossil fuels. \"The cost limitations of geothermal today are an order of magnitude smaller than the limitations for deep water oil drilling were in the early 1990s,\" said Lance Cook, chief technology officer of Sage Geosystems. The Texas-based company hopes to apply fracking techniques to geothermal energy production and has partnered with the military to test its wells on bases. If successful, the wells will provide a secure source of energy that would be difficult for adversaries to target. Geothermal fracking is small-scale and carries low risk of seismic activity or groundwater pollution. Cook, who spent nearly four decades at Shell, noted that federal regulation restricted the land startups can tap. \"If I went into federal lands where those [NEPA] surveys haven't been done, I'm probably looking at a five-year wait,\" said Cook. Companies like Sage have flocked to Texas to take advantage of its abundant private land, lenient regulations, and oil and gas experience. A variety of technological innovations could soon reduce the barriers to geothermal energy. \"Closed-loop\" geothermal systems use multiple wells to recirculate the same fluid without pumps, enabling companies to harness energy almost anywhere. And advances in remote sensing could help identify geothermally valuable areas underground without costly exploratory drilling. The Department of Energy has been supporting research and development in the industry, in part through its American-Made Geothermal Manufacturing Prize. The competition offers up to $1 million for innovations in geothermal technology. Sean Porse, who helps administer the prize, told the Free Beacon he expects the rise of 3D printing to further improve geothermal drilling operations. Geothermal advocates point to this year's power grid blackouts in Texas to show the need for consistent, or \"baseload,\" energy. Unlike wind and solar energy, a working geothermal well generates electricity at a steady rate for the entirety of its lifespan. Geothermal advocates see an opportunity to tackle several American energy problems with one solution. All that's left is to see if the Biden administration's commitment to clean energy will translate to action.

According to Lithuania\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, phones from Xiaomi Corporation contain tools that can censor phrases the Chinese government finds offensive, including \"Free Tibet,\" \"Long live Taiwan independence,\" and \"democracy movement.\" The center also reported that the phones sent encrypted user data to a server in Singapore. Those tools in Xiaomi\u2019s 5G phone software had not been turned on in the \"European Union region\" but could be turned on remotely at any time. Lithuania\u2019s vice minister of defense warned the public against buying new Chinese phones and urged Lithuanians to \"get rid of those already purchased as fast as reasonably possible.\" The Xiaomi phone uses a technique called \"client-side scanning,\" in which the phone's software searches for terms on the phone without sending data elsewhere. The tool can automatically block downloads of content containing words from a list of banned terms supplied by the Chinese government. Lithuanian officials said the list of terms was currently Chinese characters but that Latin characters could easily be added to the list. Apple made waves earlier this year when it announced it would roll out client-side scanning for child pornography on iPhones. Following the announcements, experts warned that China could co-opt the tool to hunt down political dissidents. The Lithuanian revelations show China already uses these tools on phones it manufactures. The censorship tools are the latest example of China attempting to impose its own speech standards on other countries. China pressures major international organizations not to use the word Taiwan.

In a statement Tuesday, members of the independent body slammed Facebook\u2019s \"opaque rules\" and criticized the company for lying about its \"cross-check\" system, which the Wall Street Journal reported exempts at least 5.8 million prominent users from content moderation rules. Facebook formed the independently funded Oversight Board in 2020 to regulate the social media site's content moderation decisions. The persistence of the cross-check system shows the limits of the Oversight Board. Though formally independent, the board does not have the power to compel Facebook to comply with investigations or requests for documents. Facebook has ignored Oversight Board recommendations, including that it censor fewer posts about COVID-19. Facebook has been aware for years that the cross-check system would be a public relations disaster. A 2019 internal review called the cross-check system \"not publicly defensible.\" According to the board, Facebook refused requests to explain the criteria by which pages and accounts were added to the system. Facebook convened the Oversight Board in 2020, appointing 20 members, including prominent constitutional scholars and former European heads of state. In his letter announcing the board, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, \"We\u2019re committing to providing the board with the information and resources it needs to make informed decisions.\" So far, the board has ruled mainly on content moderation issues abroad and has largely taken a free-speech stance. But in its most high-profile case, it upheld Facebook\u2019s ban of former president Donald Trump, although it called on Facebook to create a more fairly applied public safety standard. Last week, the Journal reported that Facebook has repeatedly lied to Congress about the dangers of its platform for teens. In one instance, Facebook claimed conducting research on the question was too difficult. The company has secretly studied teen behavior on Instagram for years and concluded that the platform harms a substantial minority of teens. Facebook also took heat from Congress on Tuesday after sending an unprepared executive to a Senate Judiciary hearing on dangers to teens. At one point during the hearing, Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) cited internal Facebook research showing 6 percent of teens attribute their suicidal ideation to Instagram. Facebook representative Steve Satterfield responded that he believed the company's products were \"safe.\" Other senators also took shots at Facebook during the hearing. Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah) said Facebook was acting like a monopolist, and Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) and Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) said they\u2019d been in touch with the Facebook whistleblower who exposed the cross-check system. Blackburn also said she\u2019d reviewed evidence that the Chinese Communist Party uses Facebook apps to deliver malware to the phones of Uyghurs. Despite the pressure, Facebook has forged ahead with aggressive PR campaigns. In one campaign that began this year, code-named Project Amplify, Facebook planted positive stories about itself in users\u2019 news feeds. Some of those stories were written by Facebook.

Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) is calling on the Department of Education to bolster student privacy protections after hackers released thousands of children's personal information online. In a letter obtained by the Washington Free Beacon , Blackburn implored Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to address a recent wave of cyberattacks that put children as young as five at risk of identity theft. Hackers have breached more than 1,200 schools in 2021, publishing the data they obtained on \" dark web \" sites that cannot be accessed from a search in a browser and are often used by criminals. Blackburn called the hacks \"extremely distressing.\" The recent wave of hacks is one of several education issues facing the Biden administration. Following recommendations from the nation's largest teachers' unions, the administration has only hesitantly supported reopened schools. Under Cardona, the Education Department has prioritized critical race theory, student loan forgiveness, and Title IX reforms. The Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment. According to NBC News, multiple groups of hackers have published students' Social Security numbers, birthdays, and report cards. In many cases, the targeted schools were not aware of the breaches. Hackers used personal information from a school breach in Toledo, Ohio, to take out credit cards with children's identities. Experts warn such hacks could ruin kids' credit scores years before they are old enough to realize. Hackers also accessed personal information, like whether students were homeless, qualified for at-school lunch, or were dyslexic. Some experts believe remote learning has put children's data at risk. According to cybersecurity expert Maurice Turner, \"remote learning has enabled schools to collect even more student information without the necessary safeguards to protect the sensitive data.\" Turner compared current standards to the old college practice of using Social Security numbers as student IDs. He suggested the Department of Education tie security standards to federal funding. Schools are also prime targets for hostile foreign actors. China has repeatedly stolen data from American universities over the past several years, often tapping students to steal information for Beijing. In July, the Biden administration scrapped a Trump administration proposal to strengthen government oversight of the student visa system. Lawmakers have recently called on the Biden administration to beef up federal cybersecurity protections. The Biden administration refused to sanction China for a hack on Microsoft email servers that compromised the data of millions of Americans.

China's regime has long laid claim to Taiwan, an independent island founded by those fleeing communism. Journalist Jeryl Bier on Friday morning noticed Twitter's discrepancy, which mirrors Chinese Communist Party talking points. The Washington Free Beacon confirmed the pattern and estimated that between four and five tweets with the word China show up for every one that references Taiwan . A Twitter spokesman said the company was \"looking into\" the pattern but did not give further explanation. It is not clear whether Twitter is A/B testing the search change on some users, as the search algorithm holds for some Twitter accounts but not for others. Bier noted that the pattern works in both directions: Searches for China show some tweets with the word Taiwan . The pattern suggests that Twitter maintains a policy of linking the two countries in search, perhaps as a way to placate the Chinese Communist Party. The party says that Taiwan is part of China and has escalated its rhetoric regarding a potential invasion. One of the first tweets to show up in searches explicitly referencing Taiwan is from a spokesman for China's foreign ministry and reads in part, \"Taiwan is part of China. China must and will be reunified. This historical trend cannot be stopped by any force.\" The United States does not formally recognize Taiwan but informally supports the country's government militarily and maintains a de facto embassy in the capital city of Taipei. Twitter's obeisance to China is surprising, in part because the social media platform is already banned for Chinese users. More than 50 Chinese citizens have been jailed for using the platform in breach of Chinese regulations. But China cares deeply about controlling discourse about Taiwan on American platforms. Chinese diplomats use Twitter aggressively to promote state interests and have launched campaigns to claim falsely that COVID-19 originated in America. Regime actors leveraged a large army of Twitter bots and used the StopAsianHate hashtag to encourage Americans to show up at protests. Many of the accounts had few or no followers and were used instead to increase the number of tweets with a given hashtag. Twitter is not the only Silicon Valley company to bend the knee to China. Apple allows Chinese officials to physically monitor its facilities and data centers in the country, and Microsoft aggressively censors LinkedIn to remove references to topics that the Communist Party finds sensitive.

A professor and founding director of the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown University, Bedoya has criticized big tech and called on Congress to regulate facial recognition technologies commonly used by law enforcement. His nomination signals the Biden administration\u2019s willingness to expand the scope of the FTC, an independent federal agency that enforces antitrust and consumer protection laws. If confirmed, Bedoya will solidify a Democratic majority on the Biden FTC, which voted in July to expand its authority to go after big tech. Newly installed FTC chair Lina Khan has called on the agency to target powerful tech companies, even if they don\u2019t technically qualify as monopolists. In her brief tenure as chair, Khan has moved to consolidate power at the FTC. Earlier this summer, Khan successfully pushed to make it easier for just one commissioner to open an investigation into corporate practices, meaning commissioners can pursue pet enforcement projects without buy-in from other commissioners. She has also instituted a gag order on FTC employees, saying the agency's resources are too strained to justify external speaking engagements. These changes give individual commissioners greater authority to target companies directly. Bedoya and Khan have both publicly criticized major tech platforms, and Bedoya\u2019s work has focused on facial recognition and drone tools. Bedoya has been particularly critical of companies that provide tools for immigration enforcement, calling them the \"technology behind ICE\u2019s brutality.\" FTC commissioner Rebecca Slaughter has focused on curbing race and gender bias in commonly used algorithms. Some antitrust lawyers worry the FTC\u2019s attempts to reign in big tech are out of bounds. Khan has pursued a lawsuit against Facebook that some more traditional antitrust experts have called an overreach. Bedoya has served as chief counsel for the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law and worked for Sen. Al Franken (D., Minn.). If confirmed, Bedoya would replace Rohit Chopra, an aggressive antitrust advocate who has been nominated to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Democrats currently hold a 3-2 majority on the FTC board of commissioners. House Democrats last week proposed increasing the FTC\u2019s funding by $1 billion to support a new privacy division, which Bedoya would likely be involved in.

The social media giant has conducted multiple studies that show that Instagram encouraged eating disorders and depression in teenage girls, according to documents obtained by the Journal . But when Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee in March requested Facebook's internal research on how social media affect children, the company punted. In a letter to the committee, Facebook said conducting research on the question is difficult and that experts disagree on \"how much screen time is 'too much.'\" \"Facebook refused to comply with our request and we now know why,\" committee ranking member Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.) told the Washington Free Beacon. \" This also leaves us wondering what else they are hiding. We will continue to demand transparency from Facebook and other Big Tech companies, especially as it relates to the harm their products have on our children.\" A spokesman for another committee Republican, Colorado representative Ken Buck, had similarly harsh words for social media platforms. Big Tech companies have \"almost unchecked power\" and answer \"only to themselves,\" the spokesman said. He called on Congress to pass antitrust bills to \"bring these dark and duplicitous monopolists to heel.\" Facebook has repeatedly attempted to deceive stakeholders who inquire after its operations. Other documents obtained by the Journal show the company lied to its formally independent Oversight Board. Facebook told the board that a system designed to protect high-profile users from being censored was used in \"a small number of decisions.\" In fact, Facebook exempts at least 5.8 million users from the content moderation guidelines it imposes on most people. \"We are not actually doing what we say we do publicly,\" a 2019 internal review found. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has long touted the value of \"connection\" and told Congress in March that \"the research that we've seen is that using social apps to connect with other people can have positive mental-health benefits.\" Zuckerberg by then had already seen the internal reports that link Instagram use to eating disorders and depression. A whistleblower gave some of the Facebook documents to members of Congress. House Republicans are considering several bills that would require companies to disclose potential mental health impacts of their sites and direct the National Institutes of Health to consider warning labels for certain sites. Republicans were not the only lawmakers angered by the Journal report. Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) tweeted that he was \"appalled and alarmed\" by Facebook's deception. Facebook internal documents note that its flagship platform, Instagram, and WhatsApp cause a \" ratchet effect ,\" by which spending more time on one encourages users to spend more time on the others. The Federal Trade Commission is pursuing a legal case against Facebook, saying the web of platforms makes Facebook dangerously powerful in the social media industry.

Dr. Eric Horvitz this year reported to Congress that \"China's domestic use of AI is a chilling precedent for anyone around the world who cherishes individual liberty.\" The report was the result of Horvitz's work on a panel tasked with advising Congress on artificial intelligence. The report comes as Microsoft CEO Brad Smith is meeting with top Chinese officials to discuss deepening ties in digital technology and Microsoft's work in China. Microsoft is one of many companies that capitulate to China in exchange for access to the country's lucrative market. The National Basketball Association supports political activism among its players and coaches but remains silent on China's human rights abuses and suppression of free speech. Apple allows Chinese officials to physically monitor its facilities and data centers in the country. Tech companies have also faced pressure from within their ranks to downplay Chinese human rights abuses. Apple employees have called on the company to condemn Israel for its actions in the Gaza Strip but not China for its use of slave labor. Microsoft allows China to heavily censor LinkedIn, a Microsoft subsidiary. LinkedIn creates both a Western and a Chinese profile for Western users and shutters the Chinese versions when users post phrases banned by the Chinese government. In March, LinkedIn took a step further and banned a China critic based in the United Kingdom. Smith continued his engagement with the Chinese government in a meeting last week with Xiao Yaqing, a top regulator at China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. According to Xiao, the two discussed expanding Microsoft's work with China. Horvitz sounded the alarm about China as part of his work for the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. The commission's report repeatedly warns that China's AI use is a threat to both liberty and American national security. China's \"employment of AI as a tool of repression and surveillance\u2014at home and, increasingly, abroad\u2014is a powerful counterpoint to how we believe AI should be used,\" the report's authors say. The report also highlights the dangers of China's use of artificial intelligence to more effectively leverage facial recognition technology. The authors write that China's use of AI to repress its Uyghur minority \"foreshadows how authoritarian regimes will use AI systems to facilitate censorship, track the physical movements and digital activities of their citizens, and stifle dissent.\" Microsoft has expanded data centers in China for its Azure cloud service, which includes a facial recognition software package. China in March hacked hundreds of thousands of Microsoft servers, an attack that some scholars believe was an attempt to collect data to train AI models. Microsoft responded to the attacks by expanding its business in China. The Biden administration refused to sanction Chinese actors for the attack. Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.

Unlike his opponents, the Arizona attorney general said he has been \"on the front lines against these tech companies,\" and touted his record suing Facebook to prove it. Brnovich\u2019s comments are likely directed at tech millionaire Blake Masters, a Peter Thiel acolyte and big tech critic who called for the breakup of Facebook in an interview with the Free Beacon . Masters has not held political office but has emphasized his background in the tech industry gives him a leg up in battling woke corporate power. Masters and Brnovich are two of five Republicans battling in a Senate primary that has become a lightning rod for conservative big tech debates. The winner will take on Democrat Mark Kelly in the general election. Both Masters and Brnovich may have geared up for a campaign defined by big tech, as Arizona's recent attempts to regulate Apple have made the state a lightning rod for conservative debates on the issue. But with all eyes on Afghanistan, it\u2019s likely the candidates may not be able to control which issues define their campaigns. Brnovich criticized the Biden administration\u2019s botched Afghanistan withdrawal, saying it sends the message \"that it may be bad to be an enemy of the U.S. in the Middle East, but it\u2019s worse to be an ally.\" He expressed support for Israel and roundly condemned the Iran nuclear deal. Brnovich also called China \"the greatest threat this country is facing\" and dismissed tech companies that say increased regulation would give Chinese companies a competitive edge. \"I don\u2019t believe a word,\" Brnovich said, noting that Amazon has \"bent over backwards for China\" and \"let them censor the internet.\" While he won\u2019t go so far as to call for breaking up tech companies, Brnovich has highlighted his extensive legal battles with big tech. He brought a suit against Google in 2020, arguing that the company was misleading users about how it tracked their location. The suit alleged that even after users turned off their location sharing, Google still sold their location data to third parties. He cited conversations between Google employees who acknowledged the data collection. Rather than break up big tech, Brnovich wants to take legislative steps to reduce their power. He expressed particular concern with Section 230, a federal law that protects tech companies from being sued over content they host. He is open to laws that would classify social media companies as \"common carriers,\" similar to cell service providers. Such a reform would require platforms to carry all legal speech, regardless of politics. For Brnovich, the fight against big tech is personal. His mother fled communism in Yugoslavia, an experience he said shapes his views. \"When any entity has all that kind of information, they can manipulate you, control you, they can nudge you in certain directions with the feeds and stories you get.\" Published under: Afghanistan , Arizona , Arizona Election , Big Tech Arizona GOP Senate Candidates Battle Over Big Tech Bona Fides Mark Brnovich says Blake Masters lacks experience 'on the front lines against these tech companies' MacKenzie Scott Sends Millions to Terror-Tied Nonprofit Network Bring in More Prosecutors: Finally Ending Minnesota\u2019s \u2018Never-Ending\u2019 Somali Fraud Schemes Requires Reinforcements Take My Governor\u2014Please Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Prepared To Flee to Moscow if Regime Loses Control Walz Drops Reelection Bid as Minnesota Reels From Massive Welfare Fraud Arizona GOP Senate Candidates Battle Over Big Tech Bona Fides Politics Trump Resolves the Maduro Problem The Foreign Policy Winners and Losers of 2025 As Europe Steps Back, Asia Steps Up Newsletters Morning Beacon Arizona attorney general Mark Brnovich (R.) / Twitter"

A report from cybersecurity firm Mandiant and a Google research team found that thousands of accounts on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms were involved in the network. They called on Americans, specifically New Yorkers, to show up for protests against anti-Asian discrimination and \"fight back\" against theories that the COVID-19 virus was created in a Chinese lab in Wuhan. The Twitter and Facebook accounts largely pushed #StopAsianHate, a hashtag that liberal politicians adopted in the wake of high-profile street attacks on Asian Americans. Mandiant's vice president of analysis told the Wall Street Journal that the network was \"almost certainly supported by a government sponsor, either directly through a government agency or a third-party contractor.\" The social media operation received a relatively low amount of engagement, researchers said. Although experts are still debating COVID-19's origins, a U.S. intelligence report released last week said the lab-leak theory may be the most likely explanation. China has refused to cooperate with efforts to investigate the origins of the virus, and progressive groups have called the theory racist and dangerous to Asian Americans. Social media sites initially suppressed claims that COVID was created in or escaped from a Chinese lab, labeling them \"misinformation.\" China has aggressively pushed back against allegations that the coronavirus escaped from a Wuhan lab, and multiple Communist Party officials and outlets have said the virus actually escaped from a U.S. military base. But the social media campaign may be Beijing's most aggressive push to influence Americans through social media. Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter suspended the accounts involved in the Chinese operation, citing rules that prohibit fake or secretly government-backed accounts. China has escalated its hacks of American targets, which seek individual, corporate, and government information. A hack discovered in March targeted Microsoft Exchange email servers and affected tens of millions of Americans. The Biden administration has struggled to shore up federal cybersecurity resources. The administration's proposed budget for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was $397 million short of what even some Democrats desired for the agency.

The law, called SB 8, has come under fire for a provision that lets private citizens report people who facilitate illegal abortions. In the days since it passed, tech companies have joined progressive groups to oppose the bill. GoDaddy, which hosts millions of websites, announced Friday that it would stop supporting a website that allows people to report violations of the law. Days later, Uber and Lyft announced they are establishing legal defense funds for any drivers who are charged with aiding and abetting an illegal abortion. The ride-sharing companies will each donate $1 million to Planned Parenthood. The incident highlights the increasing power that internet platforms wield in politics. Amazon Web Services kicked off conservative social media app Parler after the app was accused of hosting January 6 rioters. Right-wing app Gab suffered a similar fate in 2018. And PayPal, which has actively censored activists in the past, has announced it will partner with the left-wing Anti-Defamation League to remove the accounts of groups it deems \"extremist.\" GoDaddy made its announcement in response to a left-wing pressure campaign. After the site was unveiled, activists on TikTok created an automated tool to spam the site with thousands of fake complaints and crude messages. TikTok users employed similar tactics to reduce attendance at a 2020 Trump rally in Tulsa, which they spammed with a wave of fake signups. When users' attacks did not take the pro-life Texas website down, Gizmodo tech journalist Shoshana Wodinsky called on readers to complain directly to GoDaddy. GoDaddy gave the website's owner, Texas Right to Life, 24 hours to find a different host for its site. As of Tuesday afternoon, the website no longer exists, and the URL redirects to the homepage for Texas Right to Life. In a statement posted on the group's website, Texas Right to Life director of media and communication Kimberlyn Schwartz wrote that the group \"will not be silenced\" and vowed to put the website back up. Other tech companies have taken softer steps to oppose the Texas law. The CEO of Match Group, which owns Tinder and Hinge, announced her opposition to the bill and announced a fund for company employees in Texas to get abortions out of state. Dating app Bumble also created a fund for abortion groups. Houston-based startup Solugen, a biotech firm backed by major Silicon Valley investors, said it will stop hiring for positions in Texas and look elsewhere. The company cautioned that Texas should change the legislation if it \"wants to be a business friendly state.\" The city council of Portland, Ore., is debating a measure that would ban all purchases of goods or services from the state of Texas.

Rep. Claudia Tenney (R., N.Y.) called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Instagram head Adam Mosseri to explain why the social media sites removed posts by Shana Chappell that criticized Biden for the debacle in Afghanistan and his allegedly callous behavior at the transfer of her son's remains. Chappell's Instagram account was suspended and one of her Facebook posts was hidden, although both were later restored. Facebook, which owns Instagram, said Chappell's Instagram account was \"incorrectly deleted.\" When asked for clarification on why Chappell's Instagram account was removed, a spokesman said the platform does not \"comment on how enforcements occurred.\" Tenney wants the companies to explain their behavior. \"Our Gold Star families and the American public deserve better than this,\" she wrote. \"After sacrificing so much for the safety and security of our Nation, their speech should not be stifled by faceless Silicon Valley censors.\" Facebook and Instagram have come under fire for unclear or partisan content moderation. Facebook has \"downranked\" articles that argued COVID-19 escaped a Chinese lab. Tenney serves on the House GOP's \"Tech Task Force,\" which is preparing a legislative package to tackle the power of major tech companies. In the letter, Tenney expressed concerns about politically motivated censorship. \"I am aware that the White House acknowledged it would be flagging for Facebook, Instagram's parent company, posts it deemed 'problematic.' Weaponizing the power of the Executive Branch against an open public discourse is wholly un-American, and it would be a crucial error for Instagram to assist in this.\" Biden has not shied away from exerting leverage over Facebook. In June, he accused the platform of \"killing people\" by allowing \"misinformation\" about COVID on the site. Multiple former Facebook executives serve in the Biden White House. According to a Facebook spokesman, Chappell's \"tribute to her heroic son does not violate any of our policies.\" Chappell said that after she posted about her son, Instagram began flagging her older posts and warned that her account would be deleted if she continued posting.

Shana Chappell took to social media after her son, Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui, was killed by an ISIS-K suicide bomb outside Hamid Karzai International Airport last Thursday. On Monday, Chappell wrote several posts criticizing Biden. One of those posts began to trend on Facebook and was removed Monday night. Chappell\u2019s Instagram account was also disabled, though it has since been restored. Nikoui, 20, was one of 13 American troops caught in the bomb blast at the airport entrance where U.S. Marines and Afghan refugees were clustered. He had been deployed to help evacuate American citizens and Afghan allies as the United States retreated from Afghanistan. Hundreds of American citizens remain in Afghanistan after the U.S. military completed its evacuation Monday. Chappell said that after posting about her son, Instagram began pulling her old posts and warned her that her account would be deleted if she continued posting. In a post deleted by Facebook, Chappell claims that Biden interrupted her as she tried to speak to him about her son at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, where the dignified transfer of the service members' remains took place on Sunday. \"You then rolled your fucking eyes in your head like you were annoyed with me,\" Chappell wrote, \"and you threw your hand up behind you as you walked away from me like you were saying \u2018ok whatever.'\" That post was restored by Facebook, but another remains restricted. Chappell also criticized Biden for being distracted during the ceremony, saying she watched the president \"disrespect us all five different times\" by checking his watch. A Facebook spokeswoman told the Washington Free Beacon that Chappell's posts did not violate the site's policies and that her account was \"incorrectly deleted.\" Facebook has come under fire for not doing enough to limit the reach of the Taliban on its platforms. While Taliban posts on Facebook have been removed, the jihadist group has used Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp to establish control over Kabul. Facebook removed a major Taliban messaging group after sustained media outcry. Other relatives of the dead troops have expressed their frustration with Biden\u2019s response.

The jihadist group cut off internet and telecommunications access in the Panjshir Valley, according to the BBC and a congressional source in touch with resistance fighters. Anti-Taliban forces have gathered in Panjshir, the last region of Afghanistan not under Taliban control. Without internet access, resistance fighters could struggle to organize their efforts and communicate with the outside world. It was unclear as of Monday afternoon how the Taliban cut off access. The Panjshir crackdown shows the Taliban's increasing use of technology to centralize power. The jihadist group relied on Twitter and WhatsApp as it captured Kabul earlier this month. Blocking internet access would mimic the Cuban regime, which shuttered access to social media in June amid widespread protests. American officials have argued in favor of developing tools that would enable the United States to provide internet access in authoritarian countries. The Taliban likely does not have the ability to institute a Chinese-style internet firewall in Afghanistan, and the internet is still accessible elsewhere in the country. Residents of Kabul have been able to access social media as usual. But families of Panjshir Valley residents confirmed they had not been able to reach them in the past week. Experts worry the Taliban will attempt to impose restrictions on the internet once they secure power. Taliban leaders met with officials at the Afghanistan Telecommunications Regulatory Authority last week, ostensibly to ensure stable internet access would continue. But Mohammad Najeeb Azizi, the agency's former chairman, said , \"The internet is under threat in Afghanistan.\" Azizi suggested the Taliban might seek to limit political dissent on the internet by banning certain content. But some observers say Afghanistan could lose internet access entirely. The Taliban has destroyed dozens of cell towers in recent months. One of Afghanistan's biggest internet providers, South Africa\u2019s MTN Group, announced it will wind down its operations in Afghanistan. The Taliban may not be able to pay for the fiber optic cables that connect Afghanistan to the rest of the world, according to Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at network observation company Kentik. The Panjshir Valley\u2019s mountainous terrain has arrested Taliban advances and made it a natural base for resistance efforts. The resistance is \"fighting for the whole of Afghanistan and not just one province,\" according to a spokesman for resistance leader Ahmad Massoud. \"We are concerned about the rights of Afghans, women, and minorities,\" the spokesman said. Former Afghan vice president Amrullah Saleh is also in the Panjshir Valley and has declared himself the country\u2019s caretaker president.

Introduced by Sens. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act would require companies to ensure forced labor is not used in their supply chains. It would also direct federal departments to produce a strategy for cutting Chinese forced labor out of the U.S. supply chain. Up to one million members of the Uyghur ethnic minority have been placed in \"re-education camps\" in Western China, and many Uyghurs are trafficked across the country into forced labor programs. At least one big tech company is likely to oppose the bill. Apple lobbied heavily against a previous iteration of the legislation, spending $90,000 on its lobbying efforts . In 2020, Apple stated that it \"supported the goals\" of the act but did not address allegations it had attempted to water down sections. Apple, Nike, Coca-Cola, and other U.S. companies argued they already monitored their own supply chains for forced labor violations. A May 2021 investigation found at least seven Apple suppliers who likely use forced labor. A spokesman for Apple rejected those claims, saying the company \"found no evidence of forced labor anywhere we operate.\" Supporters of the bill say that admission shows U.S. companies are not adequately self-policing their supply chains. \"As the Chinese Communist Party is committing egregious human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, including genocide and crimes against humanity, there is no excuse to turn a blind eye,\" Rubio said in a press release. \"We must instead do everything in our power to stop them.\" At least 27 other senators have signed on to the bill as cosponsors. Apple has come under fire for its close ties with China. The company is battling to prevent users from downloading third-party apps on its devices, which experts worry helps China restrict internet access. And privacy researchers have warned that authoritarian governments could use Apple's new child pornography detection tool to hunt down political dissidents.

The Tech Transparency Project found that Apple actively promotes pornographic content and apps like Tinder to users it believes are underage. The report, released Wednesday, focused on popular apps in the \"Lifestyle\" category, with names like \"Adult Hook Up & Friend Finder\" and \"Hahanono\u2014Chat & Get Naughty.\" In at least one case, Apple hosted an app for \"one-night stands\" that allowed users to set their age as 14. The report comes as Apple attempts to prevent users from endangering minors. The company recently announced it will scan all iCloud photos to search for child pornography, frustrating privacy advocates who say Apple should enforce its own rules about showing inappropriate content to minors rather than search the photos of its users. Although Apple's terms of service formally prohibit pornography, the report found users Apple believes to be 14 can download apps that open directly onto pornography with no age filter. Users must create an Apple ID that includes their age to access the App Store. Underage users aren't barred from downloading adult content, however. It appears that Apple does not in any way use the age of users to determine what content to serve them. The report found that other big tech companies share more age data with apps, making it easier for those apps to ban underage users. According to the report, the Tech Transparency Project \"used an underage Facebook account with the same name and age as the simulated minor, and in two-thirds of the cases, Facebook blocked the attempted registration, evidently because the user wasn't old enough.\" The report's authors say Apple could take a variety of routes to reduce pornography and dating-app access for minors, including by a permanent ban of underage users. Dating apps have publicly asked Apple to alert them when an underage user downloads an app, but Apple has refused to provide that information. Apple has total control over what apps can be installed through their App Store. The company has long defended the closed system as essential for both user privacy and the protection of minors. But the pornographic and hookup apps Apple promotes to children raise questions over the value of that closed system. Apple takes 30 percent of fees paid on most apps in the App Store, although it has struck deals with larger companies like Amazon to charge less. According to the chief legal officer of the dating app Match, Apple executives said the app should be grateful Apple doesn't take all of its revenue. Critics say Apple's closed ecosystem is anti-competitive and easily abused. The Chinese government has successfully pressured the company to ban apps that mention Taiwan or allow open access to the Internet through VPNs. Industry groups are lobbying state legislatures to force Apple to allow downloads from outside its app store, which as of now are banned. Apple's refusal to limit adult apps to an adult audience could frustrate Senate Republicans, who have emphasized protecting children in their salvos against big tech companies. In an interview with the Washington Free Beacon , Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) attacked YouTube for showing harmful content to children.

The agency is refiling a claim a federal judge tossed out in June. The judge argued the FTC had not proved Facebook has a monopoly in the personal social networking market, but gave the agency an opportunity to refile the case. The FTC is an independent federal agency tasked with enforcing antitrust laws. If it prevails in this case, Facebook will be required to sell WhatsApp and Instagram. The case is a major test for newly appointed FTC chairwoman and big tech critic Lina Khan. Khan has advocated for laws that broaden definitions of anticompetitive behavior, even in cases like Facebook\u2019s where the product is free for consumers. The traditional consumer-welfare standard says companies must cause immediate harm to consumers through higher prices in order to be considered monopolies. The FTC voted 3-2 along party lines to refile the complaint, with both Republican commissioners criticizing the move. The amended complaint provides more evidence that Facebook\u2019s size and market share make it a monopolist. It argues social media companies like TikTok are not Facebook competitors, since they connect users with random content creators instead of friends and family. \"After failing to compete with new innovators, Facebook illegally bought or buried them when their popularity became an existential threat,\" said Holly Vedova, acting director for the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition. Facebook denied that it was a monopoly, saying its \"acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were reviewed and cleared many years ago, and our platform policies were lawful.\" On July 14, Facebook called for Khan to recuse herself from any cases involving the company, citing her past criticism of it. In a press release Thursday, the FTC wrote that the agency\u2019s general counsel reviewed the matter and that Khan would not recuse herself.

A decree from Communications Minister Mayra Arevich bans criticism of \"the constitutional, social and economic\" rules of the state and acts that \"alter public order.\" The decree also creates a form that Cubans can use to report each other for \"cybersecurity incidents.\" The decree comes a month after the regime restricted internet access for citizens in an attempt to stifle criticism. Penalties for violating the decree will be set in legislation later. Internet access in Cuba has been inconsistent since the protests started on July 11. After viral social media photos and videos showed protests across the island, the Cuban government curtailed access to social media sites through the state-owned internet service, ETECSA. Cuba already has multiple laws criminalizing opposition to the regime. The crackdown highlights the difficulty Cubans face in communicating with the outside world. U.S. lawmakers and officials have called for the Biden administration to ramp up efforts to provide internet access to the island, pointing to virtual private networks and cell service tools that could connect Cubans. Last week, the Senate passed a bill by Sens. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Tim Scott (R., S.C.) that establishes a fund for Cuban internet access. The Biden administration says it is exploring its options. But sources on Capitol Hill say regime sympathizers at the State Department have slow-walked efforts, frustrating lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. FCC commissioner Brendan Carr, who has pushed a multi-pronged effort to bring wireless internet to Cuba, called the Biden administration's response \"disappointing.\" \"It's been weeks since the Cuban regime shut down internet services to hide their brutal response,\" Carr told the Washington Free Beacon . \"And it's been nearly that long since the administration said it would stand with the people of Cuba by exploring ways to restore internet services.\" Carr said initial conversations with the State Department had seemed to go well, but that he has received no follow-ups or explanations as to why the administration is not acting.

Facebook said the post violated its advertising policy , which prohibits ads that link to \"low-quality\" websites, which it describes as having many ads, aggressive popups, or \"unexpected experiences.\" The Fox article contains few ads and does not appear to meet any of the \"low-quality\" standards Facebook describes. Dr. Rich McCormick, a Marine veteran and Georgia congressional candidate, shared the ad, which criticized Biden for doing \"a huge disservice\" to the U.S. military and Afghan allies. The ad linked to a Fox News Pentagon correspondent's recent piece on the Taliban insurgency, to which the Associated Press contributed. It is not clear whether Facebook has an unstated policy that targets Fox News or whether the ad violates a different rule about political advertising. The social media giant has faced recurring criticism for its handling of political ads. In October 2020, Facebook took down an ad from a pro-Trump super PAC, saying its allegation that Joe Biden supported defunding the police was \"false information.\" After publication of this article, a Facebook spokesman told the Washington Free Beacon the ad was taken down by mistake and has now been restored. \"This ad was incorrectly taken down and quickly restored,\" the Facebook spokesman said. \"Our enforcement is never perfect since machines and human reviewers make mistakes, but we're always working to improve.\" McCormick's press secretary slammed Facebook, saying \"the social media overlords will do whatever it takes to protect their liberal allies in government by censoring content they disagree with.\" McCormick is a former helicopter pilot who reentered active duty with the Navy after medical school to serve as an emergency physician in Kandahar. Facebook's explanation for the ban states, \"Low quality may include ads linking to external landing pages that have a high ad-to-content ratio, lead to an unexpected experience, feature minimal original content, or contain disruptive and low-quality ads.\" The McCormick campaign told the Washington Free Beacon that it was given no further details from Facebook but said there are only two possible reasons the ad was removed: Either \"Fox News is considered a low quality landing page by Facebook\" or \"Facebook didn't like the content of the post.\" Over two billion Facebook users see ads on the platform, making it an enticing draw for advertisers. Critics say Facebook, which receives more than a quarter of U.S. digital advertising spending, has too much control over the digital ad space. A recent poll found that 63 percent of voters say Facebook has too much power. Facebook this month disabled the accounts of New York University researchers who were studying political ads on the platform, saying it was complying with a Federal Trade Commission order. The FTC rejected that claim, saying it hoped Facebook was not using the consent order as \"a pretext to advance other aims.\" Multiple senators called on Facebook to explain its decision and to allow more nonpartisan scrutiny of its political ad practices. Facebook has come under fire for a slow reaction to widespread use of its messaging app WhatsApp by Taliban fighters. Facebook says it uses non-encrypted data to remove Taliban chats and individuals, but the tool proved essential for the Taliban's capture of Kabul, Afghanistan.

On Monday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted that residents welcomed the Taliban and that \"the situation in Kabul is under control .\" The jihadist group used WhatsApp to disseminate a similar message to Kabul residents as it entered the city. In recent days, Taliban leaders have circulated WhatsApp numbers that Afghan regime officials or soldiers could call to negotiate their surrender. The Taliban has swept across Afghanistan in the weeks following Biden's withdrawal of U.S. troops, capturing major cities with little resistance. The Pentagon on Sunday deployed an additional 1,000 troops to Afghanistan to aid evacuation efforts as Afghans and Americans swarmed Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. Administration officials said in July that they expected a Taliban takeover to take months. The Taliban has used WhatsApp and Twitter for years to share official statements, but in the past week it has escalated its use of the platforms, using WhatsApp to announce new rules for Kabul residents. On Monday, Mujahid tweeted a warning against looting and unauthorized intimidation of Afghan officials. The Taliban's \"complaint commission\" posted WhatsApp numbers for city residents to call \"if they face threats from anyone\" and set up an emergency broadcast system via the app as well. Twitter and Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, regularly banned ISIS members from their platforms. But the sites appear to let the Taliban broadcast its messages without incident. A Twitter spokeswoman told the Washington Free Beacon that it was \"proactively removing content that violates our policies.\" The spokeswoman linked to a policy banning \"hateful conduct\" and another that bans \"threatening or promoting terrorism.\" The spokeswoman did not comment on whether Twitter considers the Taliban a terrorist organization. A Facebook spokesman told the Free Beacon it would take action against accounts maintained by sanctioned groups in Afghanistan, but would not comment on specific cases. Several Taliban spokesmen have maintained Twitter accounts for years, regularly tweeting updates on negotiations and regional battles. The accounts often post photos and videos from frontlines, which are then copied and shared by pro-Taliban accounts. Only 15 percent of the Afghan population has access to the internet. Both Twitter and Facebook removed former president Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 riots and have not restored his account, citing \"incitement to violence.\" Published under: Afghanistan , Facebook , Taliban , Twitter Taliban Leaders Used Twitter and WhatsApp to Help Capture Kabul Jihadists disseminate messages to Afghan residents on social media platforms MacKenzie Scott Sends Millions to Terror-Tied Nonprofit Network Bring in More Prosecutors: Finally Ending Minnesota\u2019s \u2018Never-Ending\u2019 Somali Fraud Schemes Requires Reinforcements Take My Governor\u2014Please Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Prepared To Flee to Moscow if Regime Loses Control Walz Drops Reelection Bid as Minnesota Reels From Massive Welfare Fraud Taliban Leaders Used Twitter and WhatsApp to Help Capture Kabul Politics Trump Resolves the Maduro Problem The Foreign Policy Winners and Losers of 2025 As Europe Steps Back, Asia Steps Up Newsletters Morning Beacon TOPSHOT - Afghan militia forces stand guard at an outpost as they patrol against the Taliban fighters in the Tange Farkhar area of Taloqan in northern Takhar province on July 6, 2021.

Apple announced last week it will begin scanning user photos stored on iCloud for material found in a database of \"Child Sexual Abuse Material.\" The company claims this system will protect user privacy by scanning phones directly, rather than moving data to hackable outside servers. But privacy advocates say foreign governments could hijack the tool to track down any material it finds objectionable. Once the detection tool takes effect, Apple will \"be under huge pressure from governments to use this for purposes other than going after\" child pornography, said the Lincoln Network\u2019s Zach Graves. \"It's not that hard to imagine Beijing saying, \u2018you're going to use this for memes that criticize the government.\u2019\" Apple maintains a good relationship with China, a major consumer market that houses much of the company's supply chain. The company has used Chinese slave labor to produce its products and lobbied against legislation that would restrict imports that involve forced labor. Apple also stores the personal data of Chinese users on state-owned computer servers. Tech companies such as Google already scan user content for child pornography. But Apple is the first to embed that function directly into users\u2019 devices. Apple\u2019s method relies on visual hashes, unique representations of photographs. The tool matches hashes on user photos against a database of Child Sexual Abuse Material compiled by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other child safety organizations. Apple says it's committed to limiting the tool to scan for child pornography and would refuse requests from governments to expand the scope of the tool. But nothing built into the tool prevents Apple from using other databases in the future. \"Even a thoroughly documented, carefully thought-out, and narrowly-scoped backdoor is still a backdoor,\" said India McKinney and Erica Portnoy of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Western law enforcement have long pushed for similar access to other messaging systems like Facebook Messenger. While Apple has rejected those requests in the past, experts worry the new system raises the likelihood that governments will demand backdoor access to encrypted data. Other privacy advocates are raising concerns that Apple\u2019s detection tool could incorrectly flag certain pictures as inappropriate. The company says the odds of false-positive matches were around one in a trillion, but outside observers suggested that number was only possible in academic tests. Author and former Facebook employee Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez pointed out that Facebook, which uses similar technology, has banned many pictures of nursing mothers.

Republican lawmakers and aides told the Washington Free Beacon that the State Department refuses to work with Congress on proposals to provide internet access to Cubans. The department has denied the allegation. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) accused the officials of turning \"a blind eye to the Cuban people\u2019s demands for freedom while sympathizing with the Castro/D\u00edaz-Canel regime,\" saying they were \"complicit in enabling\" the crimes of \"a murderous tyrannical dictatorship.\" Rep. Mario D\u00edaz-Balart (R., Fla.) singled out Emily Mendrala, the State Department\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs, as the main roadblock to helping Cubans access the internet. According to D\u00edaz-Balart, the department \"is slow-walking its response ... rather than taking concrete actions to support the Cuban people in their democratic aspirations.\" Mendrala's leadership, he said, \"inspires little confidence.\" Republican aides also named Mendrala, a former Obama administration official, as the person behind the move. Mendrala leads a contingent of State Department officials who hope to establish \"normal\" relations with the Cuban regime and are wary of supporting protesters too openly. The aides said senior State Department staffers are afraid that any United States action to circumvent the government's internet ban would be viewed as \"too antagonistic to the Cuban government.\" After protests swept the island in mid-July, the Cuban regime reasserted control, using repressive tactics to crush protests. There is only one telephone service provider in Cuba, ETECSA, and the state-owned company has largely blocked access to social media websites since the protests began. A spokeswoman for the State Department said \"there is no truth to the assertion\" that Mendrala is holding up plans to bring wireless internet to Cuba. \"The department and its leadership are working tirelessly on this matter. Unfortunately, with regard to internet connectivity, there are no silver bullets,\" she said, adding that the department will \"explore every option possible.\" The congressional aides said the State Department has used similar language in their conversations but has not engaged on substance. According to one aide, Mendrala is \"the most problematic\" official, one who has made enemies \"on both sides of the aisle.\" After Rubio criticized Mendrala's \"weak\" response to the crisis on July 15, the State Department issued a statement defending her \"years of experience\" in Washington \"working to support human rights and advance the cause of democracy in Cuba.\" Mendrala helped facilitate former president Barack Obama's landmark visit to Cuba in 2016. The visit, along with the lifting of sanctions, was part of the Obama administration's push to normalize relations with the Cuban regime. After leaving the Obama administration, Mendrala spent almost four years as executive director at the Center for Democracy in the Americas, a nonprofit that works closely with the Cuban regime. She described her work there as \"promoting a U.S. policy toward Cuba based on engagement and recognition of Cuba\u2019s sovereignty.\" The Cuban protests, which began on July 11, centered on the government\u2019s calamitous COVID response and opposition to civil liberties, and quickly spread across the island. Social media videos surfaced of police beatings. There were also reports of night raids by police on protesters, sham trials, and the shooting of at least one peaceful protester. At the height of the protests, up to one in five Cubans used a tool funded by the U.S. government to access the internet. Cuban Americans have led massive protests in the United States in solidarity. One protest outside the White House attracted thousands from across the country. Other government agencies have been more active in organizing efforts to support protesters. The U.S. Agency for Global Media funded VPNs that allow Cubans to access the internet without being tracked by security forces. But experts worry that those users may be caught if security forces look through their phones. Beyond VPNs, U.S. officials have floated a variety of options for providing internet access to Cuba, including beaming a signal to the island from high-flying balloons in international airspace. FCC commissioner Brendan Carr has lobbied for the balloon proposal, pointing out that Google has already successfully used the technology. A Politico report suggested the State Department rejected that idea. \"President Biden has every resource to provide Cuba with internet,\" Rep. Mar\u00eda Salazar (R., Fla.) told the Free Beacon. \"The only thing he is missing is the will to do it."

The White House on Thursday signaled its support for an amendment to the Senate infrastructure bill that would increase government control over the currently unregulated space. Cryptocurrency advocates say the amendment from Sens. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Mark Warner (D., Va.) would kill the rapidly growing industry in the United States. The amendment is the latest move from the Biden administration to rein in the cryptocurrency industry. SEC chair Gary Gensler on Tuesday described his plans to regulate an industry he described as \"the Wild West.\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has criticized crypto \"mining\" processes, arguing they take up dangerous amounts of energy. Former Obama economist Jason Furman called into question the entire cryptocurrency space on Friday, saying , \"If the technology makes it impossible to know people\u2019s capital gains, then the technology should not exist.\" Cryptocurrency advocates say the amendment would unduly burden the industry. In particular, they criticize the amendment for its overly broad definition of what constitutes a \"broker.\" Because cryptocurrencies are decentralized, many or most participants in the space could be classified as brokers under the text\u2019s definition. And because most actors in the space are anonymous, the amendment would require participants in the industry to disclose information they have no way of accessing. Industry leaders say the amendment would force \"miners\" who devote computer power to creating new cryptocurrency out of the country. In June, China cracked down on mining, leading to an influx of mining activity in the United States. \"Banning mining in the US would be an act of legislative stupidity on a par with prohibition,\" said Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, a crypto-focused venture fund. Other observers note that the amendment could make it harder for upstart companies to compete with big tech platforms in the cryptocurrency space. Cato Institute scholar Will Duffield said decentralized networks would face administrative burdens if they were required to report every transaction. The battle over crypto amendments has delayed the massive infrastructure bill, which is expected to pass. A bipartisan group of senators has put forward a separate amendment that would restrict who has to disclose cryptocurrency transactions to the government.

A new report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that Twitter and Facebook took down fewer than one in nine reported examples of anti-Semitism over a six-week period in 2021. The center also reported hundreds of anti-Semitic posts on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. The posts include Holocaust denial, Nazi symbolism, and hashtags like #holohoax and #killthejews. The posts received 7.3 million views on the social media platforms. The study reveals social media giants' inconsistent approach to content moderation. Facebook and Twitter have suppressed scientific pieces suggesting COVID-19 could have escaped from a Chinese lab. But the platforms' efforts to fight \"misinformation\" do not extend to anti-Semitic posts. The center emphasized that the true percentage of anti-Semitic posts taken down is likely far lower than its study reported. Facebook has long struggled to deal with anti-Semitic posts. In 2018, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the site would not ban anti-Semitic content. But Facebook changed course in October 2020, announcing it would ban \"any content that denies or distorts the Holocaust.\" In that announcement, the company also said that it bans stereotypes about Jews controlling world events. The center's report found some anti-Semitic tropes were censored less than others. Posts about \"Jewish puppeteers\" controlling finances and world events were only removed 8 percent of the time, as were posts \"implicating Jewish people in a vast global conspiracy.\" Some of the posts not removed by Twitter used the hashtag #JewWorldOrder. Only 4 percent of posts that blamed Jews for COVID or for supposedly dangerous vaccines were removed by the platforms.

The Federal Court of Justice ruled on July 29 that Facebook violated German law when it removed posts from a German user that were critical of migrants. The court says Facebook should have warned the plaintiff before removing his post, explained the removal, and allowed the user to appeal the removal. Facebook has not announced how it will respond but said it will look closely at the ruling \"to ensure that we can continue to take effective action against hate speech in Germany.\" The Court of Justice's ruling is the latest challenge to Facebook's content moderation policies. In the United States, state and federal lawmakers are attempting to ban social media platforms from censoring content. Florida governor Ron DeSantis (R.) recently signed a bill that would prohibit social media companies from removing political speech and give users the right to sue platforms that do so. Facebook claims it was justified in removing the German user's post, arguing the user agreed to be bound by the company's terms of service. The court rejected Facebook's argument, claiming that those terms \"unreasonably disadvantage the users of the network contrary to the requirements of good faith.\" Without the ability to ban users or content automatically, it is unclear how Facebook would moderate content on the platform. In its defense before the German court, Facebook said it would be \"unworkable\" to communicate its reasons for removing content to every user it censors. Facebook relies on artificial intelligence tools, supplemented by low-paid overseas contractors who manually process potentially offensive or obscene content. Critics argue that this largely automated system often leads to unjustified censorship. The site has made content rules on the fly during the pandemic, \"fact-checking\" and limiting the reach of scientific pieces arguing COVID-19 could have escaped from a Chinese lab. Facebook has also made sharp changes to its rules on other content. CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended the right of Holocaust deniers to post on the platform before banning Holocaust denial from Facebook in 2020.

Is it misinformation? Lack of regulation? That it rots the brains of children? Or that it makes us shrill, annoying caricatures of ourselves? An Ugly Truth , by New York Times reporters Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang, pins all these problems and more on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg. The authors don't hold back: Before even opening the book, one encounters remarkably unflattering images of Zuckerberg's and Sandberg's faces on the cover. As the authors explore the rise of Facebook, they maintain this tenor: The two executives are the twin poles of power at Facebook, and together are responsible for a vast set of the world's problems. Zuckerberg and Sandberg certainly come off as unsavory characters\u2014the CEO calls early Facebook users \"dumb fucks\" for blithely giving away their personal information. Sandberg screams at employees in public. Despite her heralded \"lean-in\" feminism, the COO picks favorites among women at the company. But An Ugly Truth packs so many separate lines of attack into one narrative that even the biggest Facebook critic will be left wondering what the coherent critique here is. Is Facebook bad because its News Feed flattens the world and amplifies toxic partisanship and misinformation? Perhaps, but then the authors attack Facebook's decision to prioritize Groups, a tool for connecting like-minded people and escaping the News Feed. The authors are quick to defend Facebook from charges of left-leaning bias. On the revelation that Facebook engineers actively tried to stop Republicans from trending in the Trending Topics, they tell us, the engineers \"were not pushing a liberal or conservative agenda.\" The fact that Sandberg was a top donor to Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign is a PR problem, but when another Facebook exec sits behind Brett Kavanaugh at his confirmation hearing, it's a company-wide crisis. If there is a single through-line in An Ugly Truth , it's this: Believing false things is one of the worst things that can happen to an individual, and Facebook inaugurated a new era of widespread misinformation. The First Amendment right to free speech isn't absolute, and no one has a right to \"algorithmic amplification.\" In a better world, platforms would work hand in hand with \"disinformation experts,\" left-wing civil rights groups, and \"trusted organizations\" like the CDC to ceaselessly protect users from believing false things. They would prioritize news from \"respectable\" sources and downplay questionable conservative partisans. The problem with this framing, of course, is that we already live in the world Frenkel and Kang dream of. Facebook does coordinate with the federal government, it does censor theories the World Health Organization and CDC consider objectionable, and it does tag posts about COVID with an informational bar urging you to listen to the experts. It does \" shadowban \" content it thinks is misleading, and it purges the accounts of individuals who express political beliefs beyond the pale. Those actions haven't fixed the problem Frenkel and Kang identify, because they can't: There's never been a time when misinformation wasn't an endemic part of human life, or when the line between safe truths and dangerous lies was settled and accepted by all. Facebook centralizes many of our disputes and may be responsible for a crappier public discourse. But the authors yearn for a solution to basic human foibles, crafted by our bien pensant elites. It's not clear that such a solution could exist, and it's certainly not clear that Frenkel and Kang's preferred authorities have the wisdom to carry them out. The punch that lands cleanest from Frenkel and Kang is the critique of Zuckerberg's worldview\u2014that \"connection\" is the great good Facebook can provide. Over and over, Zuckerberg tells us Facebook is in the business of \"connecting the world,\" but rarely can he articulate reasons that connection is good for us on a social or personal level. The authors highlight a particularly damning internal memo by exec and Zuckerberg ally Andrew Bosworth. \"We connect people. Period. That's why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices. \u2026 The work we will likely have to do in China someday. All of it.\" Bosworth later claimed the memo was meant to inspire debate, but it reads as an accurate mission statement. There's a book to be written about Facebook's vision of connection\u2014a world where users are fed the content and connections the algorithm thinks they want, with little regard for their edification or real-world effects. Unfortunately, An Ugly Truth isn't that book.

The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism will expand its database of terrorist content to cover content shared by white nationalist and alt-right users, Reuters reported Monday. Tech companies, including Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Twitter, rely on the forum's database to automatically remove inappropriate content. Experts worry that the forum's lack of transparency could cause some users to be unfairly censored. The forum's initiative allows social media companies to point to an external standard for content moderation. Social media companies have been criticized for cracking down on speech without offering a justification to users. Facebook recently came under fire for \"fact-checking\" reports that the coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab. The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism was created in 2017 to censor content from U.N.-designated terrorist organizations. The forum's board is advised by the European Union's Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs, which recently released a report entitled \"It's Not Funny Anymore: Far-Right Extremists' Use of Humor.\" The report warns that some of the most common memes on the internet are being coopted by \"far-right circles\" to \"gradually radicalise\" users. The group recommends that if companies don't remove certain content directly, they should \"quarantine extremist humour\u2014and therefore extremist ideas\" by limiting its reach. The report also recommends that content moderators should \"build up effective partnerships with progressive communities.\" Some watchdog groups warned that the forum needs to improve its accountability and transparency as it expands its reach. \"As the database expands, the risks of mistaken takedown only increase,\" said Emma Llanso, director of free expression at the Center for Democracy & Technology. Nicholas Rasmussen, the forum's executive director, acknowledged that expanding the database increased the risk of \"violating someone's rights on the internet to engage in free expression.\" Published under: Big Tech , Censorship , European Union Content Moderation Group Favored by Big Tech Expands Scope of Blacklisted Content Experts worry that the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism could unfairly censor users MacKenzie Scott Sends Millions to Terror-Tied Nonprofit Network Bring in More Prosecutors: Finally Ending Minnesota\u2019s \u2018Never-Ending\u2019 Somali Fraud Schemes Requires Reinforcements Take My Governor\u2014Please Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Prepared To Flee to Moscow if Regime Loses Control Walz Drops Reelection Bid as Minnesota Reels From Massive Welfare Fraud Content Moderation Group Favored by Big Tech Expands Scope of Blacklisted Content Politics Trump Resolves the Maduro Problem The Foreign Policy Winners and Losers of 2025 As Europe Steps Back, Asia Steps Up Newsletters Morning Beacon"

The move indicates that PayPal is increasingly comfortable letting left-wing activists decide who should have access to their system. Social media platforms have long used concerns about \"hate speech\" and \"extremism\" to remove users, but those tactics are increasingly being used to deny access to other sectors. This is not the first time PayPal has banned users based on their politics. The platform removed a number of alt-right influencers in 2017, citing the need to strike a balance between \"respect for people of all backgrounds and upholding the values of free expression.\" The ADL partnership will not focus on explicitly criminal activity, instead targeting \"bigotry in all its forms.\" Reuters reports that the partnership will target both racial and \"anti-immigrant bigotry.\" The ADL bills itself as \"the world's leading anti-hate organization,\" but it regularly gets involved in partisan politics. The organization strongly opposed Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court, citing his \"hostility to reproductive freedom.\" It has also worked with Al Sharpton to lobby Facebook for more aggressive censorship. LULAC came under fire for funneling illegal corporate donations to Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. The partnership received immediate support from Democratic officials. The press release quoted Manhattan district attorney Cy Vance Jr. as saying, \"I applaud PayPal and the ADL for joining forces to combat hate and extremist movements who seek to utilize financial platforms to bankroll their criminal activities and profit from the spread of racism and bigotry.\" Published under: Anti-Defamation League , Big Tech , Facebook , Free Speech , Hillary Clinton PayPal and the ADL Are Hiding Their Partners in an Effort To Fight Extremism Coalition leaders say their goal is to deplatform groups they deem objectionable MacKenzie Scott Sends Millions to Terror-Tied Nonprofit Network Bring in More Prosecutors: Finally Ending Minnesota\u2019s \u2018Never-Ending\u2019 Somali Fraud Schemes Requires Reinforcements Take My Governor\u2014Please Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Prepared To Flee to Moscow if Regime Loses Control Walz Drops Reelection Bid as Minnesota Reels From Massive Welfare Fraud PayPal and the ADL Are Hiding Their Partners in an Effort To Fight Extremism Politics Trump Resolves the Maduro Problem The Foreign Policy Winners and Losers of 2025 As Europe Steps Back, Asia Steps Up Newsletters Morning Beacon (Justin Sullivan / Getty Images)"

In an open letter to NASA administrator Bill Nelson, Bezos said he would personally fund construction of the \"human landing system\" after his company, Blue Origin, lost the bid to SpaceX. Bezos maintains that SpaceX won the project inappropriately, since NASA originally promised to contract with two companies. Experts say a challenge from Bezos could further delay the lunar program, Artemis, which is already running behind schedule. This letter is not the first time Bezos has attempted to wrench government contracts away from competitors. After Amazon Web Services lost a Department of Defense cloud contract to Microsoft in 2019, Bezos sued the federal government, leading to a lengthy legal battle and the eventual cancellation of the contract. Senator Mike Lee (R., Utah) has pushed for a thorough investigation of potential corruption in how the contract was awarded, after Amazon lobbyists helped craft the contract specifications. NASA's Artemis program was launched in 2017 to establish a permanent commercial and scientific presence on the moon. NASA envisions launching a space station that will orbit the moon by 2023 and hopes to send astronauts to that station and then to the moon by 2024, although it is running behind schedule. Technology developed through Artemis is intended for eventual use for an inaugural manned mission to Mars. Blue Origin has struggled to compete in the space industry, and multiple former employees complain of a slow-moving, cautious company culture. Bezos stepped down as Amazon CEO in July to devote more time to Blue Origin, and recent reports indicate he is overhauling the company's approach in an effort to catch up to SpaceX. Blue Origin's initial bid for the contract was priced at almost double that of SpaceX and did not contain any of the promises of private funding in the new offer. SpaceX received $2.9 billion from NASA in the original contract and promised to invest $6 billion of its own capital into necessary launch and landing technology. The Government Accountability Office is determining whether NASA erred in awarding the Artemis contract to SpaceX alone. The agency says budget constraints prevented it from awarding the contract to two firms, as originally planned.

Several American companies say they can quickly provide internet access to Cuba once they secure federal funding and approval. But multiple sources told the Washington Free Beacon that the State Department has yet to make those assurances, in part because some officials are worried about alienating the Cuban government. Lawmakers say this inaction is unnecessary and puts Cuban lives at stake. \"Cubans are being kidnapped and tortured by the regime, and they aren't able to broadcast this abuse to the world,\" Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.) told the Free Beacon . \"The Biden administration must lead the international community in reconnecting the Cuban people to the world. The technology is there\u2014this should already be done.\" Protests erupted in Cuba this month in opposition to the country's communist dictatorship and its botched COVID response. The Cuban regime responded by arresting and imprisoning protesters in undisclosed locations and restricting citizens' already limited internet access. Though the internet blockade has made it hard for outside observers to monitor the situation, human rights groups have condemned the regime for abusing protesters. One plan being shopped on Capitol Hill would use high-altitude balloons to beam internet access to Cuba. A similar program used balloons to provide internet access to Puerto Rico in the wake of a 2017 hurricane. Raven Aerostar, the South Dakota company that manufactured those balloons, told Senate staffers it could have balloons up and running in a matter of weeks. Policymakers have warmed to the proposal, which uses proven technology and would not require smuggling material into Cuba. But the Biden administration has reportedly soured on that plan, proposing instead to support virtual private networks that would allow Cubans to circumvent government firewalls. One federally funded VPN gave 1.4 million Cubans internet access at the height of the protests last week. \"The Administration is working closely with the private sector and the U.S. Congress to identify viable options to make the internet more accessible to the Cuban people,\" a State Department spokesperson told the Free Beacon . \"We will be actively collaborating with the private sector to identify creative ways to ensure that the Cuban people have access to the free flow of information on the internet.\" FCC commissioner Brendan Carr told the Free Beacon on Thursday that VPNs should be only one part of a broader effort to provide internet access to Cuba. He mentioned other viable proposals, including plans to deliver satellite phones to Cubans and provide WiFi to central Havana from the American embassy. \"Whether it's balloon tech or something similar, the federal government should stand up this strategic capability so that we can help Cuba right now, and potentially the next Cuba,\" Carr said. Expanding internet access is just one response the Biden administration is considering. A State Department official said Wednesday that the United States would sanction certain Cuban leaders. And the president has convened a working group to consider allowing Americans to send money to family in Cuba, though he has not asked the Cuban government to remove its 15 percent tax on such payments.

Jonathan Kanter is a former Federal Trade Commission lawyer who has long criticized Google for its market power. He runs an \"antitrust advocacy boutique,\" the Kanter Law Group, which has worked for Google competitors pushing for more rigorous antitrust enforcement. If confirmed, Kanter would oversee an ongoing Justice Department antitrust case against Google. The suit specifically targets the \"tying\" agreements Google makes with various companies, including Apple, to make Google the default or only search engine available to users. Google accounts for almost 90 percent of search queries in the United States. Kanter is the latest prominent tech critic Biden has picked for crucial antitrust jobs. Lina Khan, the recently confirmed FTC chair, rose to prominence arguing Amazon is a monopolist. She has moved quickly to make the agency her own, publicly warning tech companies and placing a gag order on staff. Tim Wu, now \"special assistant to the president on technology and competition policy,\" wrote a book titled The Curse of Bigness , calling for the breakup of major companies. Antitrust experts question how far FTC and Justice Department officials can pursue tech companies without changes to existing laws. Bills that would expand federal antitrust power are being considered in the House. The Biden administration has signaled its willingness to go after big tech. Biden has repeatedly suggested repealing Section 230, which protects social media companies from being held responsible for speech on their platforms.

The United Kingdom, European Union, and NATO joined the United States in condemning China for facilitating the March attack on Microsoft Exchange email servers. But President Joe Biden and State Department spokesman Ned Price dismissed the need for retaliation, causing some lawmakers to question the Biden administration\u2019s ability to combat hostile foreign actors. \"The recent Microsoft Exchange hack is just the latest in a series of escalating cyber threats to come out of China, and yet this administration continues to bury its head in the sand as it has done on Russia,\" Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R., N.Y.) told the Washington Free Beacon. \"The United States must make it clear that there are severe consequences for cyberattacks that affect Americans and our allies and partners.\" The Biden administration has come under fire for its inconsistent response to foreign cyberattacks. The White House sanctioned Russia in April following Kremlin-directed hacks on critical U.S. infrastructure. But Biden came under fire in June for giving Russian president Vladimir Putin a list of targets that should remain \"off-limits\" to cyberattacks. Cybersecurity experts said the wide range of the Microsoft hack seemed designed to target vulnerable civilians, including those without any clear national security connection. The Free Beacon reported that rather than severing ties with the country, Microsoft responded to the hack by expanding its footprint in China. A senior administration official told reporters that U.S. partners were unwilling to back sanctions against China. National security experts said the hack shows China\u2019s growing ambitions in cyberspace and warrants a tough response. \"We see China as the long-term pacing threat for the United States,\" said Mark Montgomery, a senior director for the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. \"Even in a perfect environment, we would still be a year or two away from things being smooth.\" The Biden administration has struggled to shore up federal cybersecurity resources. The administration\u2019s budget for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was more than $397 million short of what even some Democrats desired for the agency. And experts warn that several top cybersecurity positions have yet to be filled. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

According to Brad Stone in Amazon Unbound , company execs asked founder Jeff Bezos whether they should \"prioritize the sale of high-end clothing \u2026 or should it favor low-end generic apparel and private label products across Amazon.com and via the Amazon Marketplace.\" Bezos answered, \"I think we should target everybody who wears clothes.\" That decision led to a massive influx of Chinese products, undercutting American prices by mass-producing clothing and gadgets designed to fall apart. As Amazon\u2019s system relies heavily on user reviews, the move also created a cottage industry of selling positive reviews in exchange for free products. (This author and myriad college students in need of cheap string lights and socks are intimately familiar with the practice.) Curiously, Stone sees this as a good thing. He quotes an Amazon executive who traveled to China and saw firsthand the mountains of low-cost product: \"We realized that people charging ten to fifty times what products actually cost to make, based on a brand name, wasn\u2019t going to last and consumers would be the winners.\" Amazon Unbound is an insightful corporate history, but it\u2019s really about Jeff Bezos\u2014his neuroses, his brilliance as a corporate leader, and his long evolution into an American Caesar, willing to do battle with powerful political figures. For a book that is full of praise for the company, Unbound details the cutthroat culture that enables its success and the remarkable power its founder has become a natural at wielding. The book is also Stone\u2019s second on the topic: His first, The Everything Store , charted the company\u2019s remarkable rise from garage bookstore to retail titan over its first 10 years. Stone has a fair claim to the title of Amazon\u2019s premier chronicler, and Unbound displays his remarkable access to key decision-makers within the cavernous Amazon system. At times readers may be frustrated at the gentleness of the author\u2019s prose. The company\u2019s expansion into India, an arduous and not entirely successful move, is painted as brilliant. But Stone is also frank about the side effects of Bezos\u2019s brilliance, like the famously grinding, Darwinian office culture. Many aspects of that culture come directly from the top. Bezos has battled to keep the practice of stack ranking, in which workers are ranked regularly by their bosses and the lowest-scoring batch are automatically canned. Bezos\u2019s reach goes beyond corporate decisions. In one inadvertently funny passage, Bezos sits down with Washington Post execs to come up with a new branding statement for his paper. \"If this was on a T-shirt, would you want to wear it?\" he asks. He then suggests a phrase he likes: \"Democracy dies in darkness.\" The Post takes another year to consider alternatives, hires outside branding agencies (which suggest taglines like \"Freedom moves in light\"), before settling on the owner\u2019s preferred slogan. Stone is also soft on Amazon\u2019s treatment of third-party sellers. The company has made waves in the past year for reforms to its Prime system that force third-party sellers off the platform. FTC chair Lina Khan has used this behavior as an example of Amazon\u2019s incredible market power. While perhaps not formally a monopoly under traditional metrics, Amazon has grown massively by running services below cost for years, providing a platform for third-party sellers (and pulling even more users onto the site), then cracking down on those sellers once it has achieved dominance. Bezos stepped down as Amazon CEO earlier this month to focus on his dreams of interplanetary civilization through his space company, Blue Origin. In this dream, he\u2019s remarkably similar to fellow billionaire and cultural lodestone Elon Musk, with whom he has publicly clashed (Musk is critical of Blue Origin\u2019s approach). Before he left, Amazon announced an expansion of its executive team, adding more bloat to a historically lean and aggressive leadership. If Stone\u2019s book is any indication, Blue Origin will benefit from Bezos\u2019s more direct involvement and intensity, while Amazon may suffer. Whether Americans will benefit from his move is less clear.

Called Project Loon, the initiative was shuttered due to a lack of commercial viability. Carr said sourcing the balloons and \"de-mothballing\" them from warehouses would pose a logistical problem but noted the technology had been successfully used around the world, including in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria destroyed cell towers in the country. Carr said the technology would not immediately connect every Cuban smoothly to the internet. \"I would say the goal is not universal coverage with speeds that would allow you to download Netflix. The question is, how do we create the opportunity to continue to share videos and photos?\" Videos of protests across the island have spread under the hashtag #SOSCuba. In response, the Cuban regime appears to have tried to shut down access to WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram, Twitter, and other social media. Cubans have reported they are unable to access the country's sole telephone service provider. The regime has denied blocking access to the internet. Cubans have long struggled to access the web in a country due to censorship and poor internet infrastructure. According to the nonprofit Freedom House, Cuba has one of the lowest connectivity rates in the Western Hemisphere. Some doctors and state employees can access dial-up internet in their homes, but most Cubans rely on a combination of VPNs , USB drives, scratch-off Wi-Fi cards, and some recently installed public wifi to connect to the outside world. Project Loon balloons function much like traditional cell towers, but float for roughly 100 days at extremely high altitudes, above airplanes and clouds. Their distance from the ground enables them to cover a broader area. Carr said the United States faces both an urgent need to support protesters now and a strategic, long-term need for this technology. In the short term, Carr said that \"we need to bolster attempts to circumvent the blocking technology\" used by the Cuban regime. Going forward, balloon internet technology would help citizens of brutal regimes around the world. Florida Republicans have led the push for internet access in Cuba, with Governor Ron DeSantis calling on President Biden to provide funding and federal resources. \"What does the regime do when you start to see these images?\" DeSantis said. \"They shut down the internet, they don't want the truth to be out, they don't want people to be able to communicate.\" Senator Marco Rubio, who is Cuban-American, called on \"innovative American companies\" to provide internet access. In a press conference Thursday, Biden said his administration would look into ways to deliver internet to the island. \"They've cut off access to the internet. We're considering whether we have the technology to reinstate that access,\" Biden said. The Cuban communist regime has taken advantage of the internet for its own ends.

A YouTube spokesman said late Tuesday that the decision to reinstate the video less than 12 hours after it was taken down came after \"further review.\" \"Upon further review, we\u2019re reinstating the Lake Forest School District\u2019s video,\" the spokesman said. \"We have policies in place to allow content that might otherwise violate our policies as long as it includes educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content.\" The company directed the Free Beacon to a policy document created before the COVID pandemic began to explain the decision. The video of the Monday evening board meeting was removed by YouTube by Tuesday morning for violating the site's \"community guidelines.\" Those who watched the video told the Washington Free Beacon it included requests from parents to make masks optional. Lake Forest chief communications officer Melissa Oakley said the school filed an appeal to YouTube but has not heard back. YouTube's guidelines prohibit videos that question the World Health Organization's COVID policies, including a recommendation that children twelve and older wear masks indoors. The platform has removed more than 30,000 videos containing \"COVID misinformation\" since the beginning of the pandemic, including a discussion hosted by Florida governor Ron DeSantis (R.) in which panelists suggested masks weren't necessary for children. Studies have shown that in-school COVID transmission is incredibly rare. CDC guidelines recommend children who are not fully vaccinated wear masks indoors, but school districts have freedom to set their own policies. CDC data indicate 49,047 deaths of people under the age of 18 last year, of which only 331 were from COVID-19. Oakley said Lake Forest High records its meeting by livestreaming directly to YouTube, which means it cannot now access the video. She said YouTube had also pulled a previous board meeting.

The order instructs the Federal Trade Commission to more closely monitor merger attempts by \"dominant internet platforms\" and to restrict how tech companies can exploit users' personal information. But it also recommends that the Federal Communication Commission restore net neutrality rules, which prevent internet providers from making distinctions among users. Tech giants like Facebook and Amazon support net neutrality because it bars internet providers from charging platforms based on their broadband use. The order signals the Biden administration's confused approach to big tech regulation. At the signing ceremony, the president called out big tech directly, describing the executive order as an effort to promote \"fair competition,\" one of the administration's priorities. But Biden still has not nominated a nominee for assistant attorney general for antitrust, a major enforcement position. Congress is considering considers legislative proposals to regulate the biggest tech companies, but there is little consensus on what approach to take. Politico reported that the executive order was shaped in part by Tim Wu, a professor now serving in the Biden administration as a special adviser on economic and tech policy. Wu and FTC chairwoman Lina Khan have been some of the administration's most aggressive voices in calling for increased scrutiny of major tech companies. Wu is one of the most ardent proponents of net neutrality, a term he coined in 2003. The Trump administration rolled back net neutrality regulations in 2017 in an attempt to increase broadband competition. At the time, Democratic lawmakers and social media giants warned that the change would lead to providers restricting users' internet access and discriminating against certain content providers. Those concerns proved to be overblown, though Facebook and Twitter have recently come under fire for discriminating against conservative content. One of the order's provisions seems aimed at Amazon. It calls for rules barring internet marketplaces from exploiting their power by copying the products of smaller sellers on their platforms. The order will likely increase regulatory scrutiny of Amazon's planned purchase of MGM Studios. The order contains a variety of \"suggestions\" for independent agencies, which prompted accusations from industry groups and think tanks that the administration is pressuring agencies to fall in line. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank that takes funding from big tech companies, said, \"The White House is attempting to meddle into the work of federal antitrust agencies.\" The order also contains a variety of non-tech related provisions, including a request for the Department of Agriculture to issue additional rules to support small farmers and meatpackers. And it asks the FTC to issue rules banning \"unnecessary occupational licensing restrictions,\" the practice of requiring employees to obtain a license before entering certain industries.

The agenda, released by House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), outlines specific proposals Republicans on the committee will attempt to include in legislation. The roadmap calls for legislation that would \"speed up and strengthen antitrust enforcement, hold Big Tech accountable for its censorship, and increase transparency around Big Tech's decisions.\" Jordan's agenda is the latest attempt by House Republicans to secure more stringent speech protections for conservatives on major social media platforms. While the majority of Republicans endorse this approach, a smaller contingent of lawmakers wants to target tech companies for their size and market power. Last month, the House Judiciary Committee voted to advance a package of bipartisan bills that would empower regulators to go after big tech monopolies. One of the agenda's proposals would allow state attorneys general to appeal antitrust cases directly to the Supreme Court. Another proposal, originally from Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), would move antitrust enforcement from the Federal Trade Commission to the Department of Justice. A third would punish \"subjective content moderation decisions,\" making it harder for social media companies to censor certain viewpoints. Jordan's agenda specifically targets Section 230, a federal law that says companies are not liable for the speech on their platforms. The agenda proposes stripping away those protections so users can sue social media companies. But experts have questioned whether removing Section 230 protections from tech companies would lead to freer expression online. Some Republicans want to go beyond removing Section 230 protections. Rep. Ken Buck (R., Colo.) has cosponsored several bipartisan bills that would stop mergers and acquisitions from big companies and could force them to break up their businesses into separate product lines. Those bills would substantially increase the FTC's power, a move Jordan and his allies oppose. Lina Khan, President Joe Biden's newly appointed FTC chair, has called for far more aggressive antitrust enforcement against large digital companies. Khan was confirmed by the Senate in a bipartisan 69-28 vote. House Judiciary Committee members clashed over the FTC's role during a recent markup of Buck's legislation. Some lawmakers expressed concern over comments from FTC commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a Democrat, indicating the Biden administration plans to use the FTC to promote social justice goals. Slaughter has said FTC enforcement can't be \"value-neutral\" and in a Tweet called for using antitrust tools to create an \"#antiracist economy.\" In that markup, GOP lawmakers clashed over antitrust provisions, with Buck calling attempts from Jordan and Rep. Darrell Issa (R., Calif.) to insert Section 230 changes into his bills \"poison pills,\" designed to force Democrats to vote no on big tech restrictions. He also suggested both Democrats and Republicans from California were too cozy with tech companies. Legislation on reining in tech companies will likely not receive a vote until this fall. A bipartisan group of California lawmakers said the bills were \"not close to ready for floor consideration.\" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said he had no imminent plans to bring the bills to a vote, noting that Democrats were split over them.

Some antitrust experts criticized the old guidance for tying the hands of the FTC. With that guidance removed, the FTC will now have greater authority to administer civil penalties for anti-competitive behavior. In a sign of the shifting political landscape, all three Democrat-appointed commissioners voted to strike the Obama-era guidance, while the two GOP-appointed commissioners defended it. \"This was a summation of black-letter antitrust law during the Obama administration,\" said antitrust expert Jennifer Huddleston, noting the guidance was \"not seen as particularly controversial\" when passed in 2015. The change is a win for newly appointed FTC chair Lina Khan, who has argued that companies as big as Facebook or Amazon may be a danger to competition even if they don't strictly qualify as monopolies. Khan first rose to prominence with a 2017 law review article that argued traditional antitrust standards don't adequately capture the \"architecture of market power in the modern economy.\" Amazon makes $1 billion a day in revenue and has faced widespread criticism for forcing third-party sellers off of its marketplace. Khan defended the commission's decision, claiming the old guidance constrained \"the FTC's unique authority\" and turned its power into \"a dead letter.\" But FTC commissioner Christine Wilson bemoaned the change, saying the old guidance reflected \"more than a century of precedent.\" Alden Abbott, the FTC's general counsel during former president Donald Trump's term, warned that abandoning the statement would \"create great confusion and uncertainty for the private sector.\" Both criticized any move away from the \"consumer welfare standard,\" which holds that only companies that directly harm consumers can be labeled monopolies. Khan, who President Joe Biden nominated to the FTC in March, was confirmed by the Senate in June. She earned votes from multiple Republican senators who endorsed her goal of cracking down on corporate power. Amazon on Wednesday called on Khan to recuse herself from any antitrust cases involving the retail giant, saying she could not be trusted to be objective after criticizing the company's dominance. The rule change has immediate implications for the FTC's lawsuit against Facebook, which alleges that the social media giant has too much power over the social networking market. A federal judge dismissed the case in June, saying the FTC had not met the high burden of proof to show Facebook has a technical monopoly. Under the new guidance, the FTC could prosecute the trillion-dollar company anyway. In Thursday's meeting, the FTC commissioners also voted 3-2 to finalize a \"Made in America\" rule long sought by Trump.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia heard the two lawsuits , brought by the Federal Trade Commission and a group of state attorneys general, respectively. Both suits alleged that Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram constituted anti-competitive behavior. But Judge James Boasberg ruled against both plaintiffs. Boasberg, an Obama appointee, said the FTC did not prove Facebook holds a monopoly over its market and that the attorneys general had brought their case too late after the acquisitions. Both suits were dismissed \"without prejudice,\" which means the FTC and the attorneys general can file amended complaints. But the rulings illustrate the roadblocks toward curbing the power of major tech platforms despite increased congressional interest in doing so. Antitrust suits must prove the companies in question have a high level of \"market power\" and are therefore monopolies. Boasberg said the FTC had not proven Facebook\u2019s 60 percent share of the market for \"Personal Social Networking services\" constituted a monopoly. Boasberg noted that \"this case involves no ordinary or intuitive market,\" since the product is free and users can use more than one social media platform at a time. According to Rep. Ken Buck (R., Co.), a prominent Republican supporter of increased oversight of big tech companies, \"Today\u2019s development in the FTC\u2019s case against Facebook shows that antitrust reform is urgently needed.\" Buck called for \"additional tools and resources to our antitrust enforcers\" to target companies like Facebook. Buck is the cosponsor of several bipartisan antitrust bills that will go to the House floor later this summer. One bill would bar Apple, Facebook, Google, and Amazon from any new mergers or acquisitions. Others would increase funding for the FTC and expand regulatory definitions of anti-competitive behavior. Although the bills have received support from some Republicans, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) and allies have called the bills insufficient. Rep. Darrell Issa (R., Calif.) said the bills did not address big tech censorship of conservatives online and called for bills that would allow users to sue when their political posts are censored. Facebook bought the photo sharing app Instagram in 2012. It acquired WhatsApp, an internationally popular messaging app, in 2014. The state attorneys general allege that Facebook\u2019s aggressive strategy of buying competitors constituted anti-competitive behavior. Those mergers escaped scrutiny at the time. In a tweet, Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) called the rulings \"deeply disappointing\" and said the court acknowledged Facebook\u2019s \"massive market power but essentially shrugged its shoulders.\" Published under: Big Tech , Facebook , Josh Hawley Facebook Prevails In Antitrust Challenges Federal court dismisses two lawsuits alleging anti-competitive behavior MacKenzie Scott Sends Millions to Terror-Tied Nonprofit Network Bring in More Prosecutors: Finally Ending Minnesota\u2019s \u2018Never-Ending\u2019 Somali Fraud Schemes Requires Reinforcements Take My Governor\u2014Please Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Prepared To Flee to Moscow if Regime Loses Control Walz Drops Reelection Bid as Minnesota Reels From Massive Welfare Fraud Facebook Prevails In Antitrust Challenges Politics Trump Resolves the Maduro Problem The Foreign Policy Winners and Losers of 2025 As Europe Steps Back, Asia Steps Up Newsletters Morning Beacon"

David Cicilline (D., R.I.) exempted Microsoft from a bill he sponsored to regulate big tech three months after he received $5,800 in donations from Microsoft president Brad Smith, FEC filings show. Cicilline's decision to accept the money marked an about-face for the Rhode Island congressman, who swore off big tech money in 2019. Cicilline is the lead sponsor of the American Choice and Innovation Online Act , which would ban tech companies above a certain size from using their platforms to unfairly promote their own products. The bill originally applied to platforms with 500,000 monthly active users. Earlier this month, the threshold was quietly changed to 50 million active users, a change that would exempt Microsoft. Cicilline did not explain why the bill text had changed to exclude Microsoft. But the donation from Microsoft\u2019s CEO raises questions of how much influence tech companies have over bills designed to regulate their industry. In 2019, Cicilline announced he would not take money from big tech companies. On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee debated a package of bills that would force big tech companies to provide data to competitors and give the Federal Trade Commission more tools to regulate them. Rep. Thomas Massie (R., Ky.) displayed an early draft of the bill marked \"confidential Microsoft\" obtained from a whistleblower, and suggested that Microsoft had received an early copy. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D., Calif.) proposed an amendment that would make Microsoft subject to the bill once again, which was defeated in an 18-25 vote. Brad Smith has bragged about his company\u2019s close ties to the Hill, telling CNBC \"there are times when I call people who I don\u2019t personally know, and somebody will say \u2018you know, your folks have always shown up for me at my events. And we have a good relationship. Let me see what I can do to help you.\u2019\" When Microsoft attempted to buy TikTok, Smith personally called dozens of lawmakers to push the bid through. As pressure on tech from Washington has increased over the past year, so has aggressive lobbying from big tech companies. Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly called Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday to complain that the antitrust bills were rushed. The bills are the products of an 18-month House investigation into market power in the tech industry. The lobbying pressure has not gone unnoticed on the Hill. In a June 22 Senate hearing, Senator Mike Lee (R., Utah) was visibly frustrated as he blasted \"well compensated lobbyists and their nonprofit proxies\" who \"pervert conservative economic and legal philosophy into a defense of big tech monopoly.\" Facebook and Amazon are now the largest corporate lobbying spenders in the country. Cicilline\u2019s spokesman claimed in April 2021 that he does not accept money from executives at tech firms. At the time, Politico noted that Cicilline had received $1,000 from a lobbyist for Apple. Smith has praised Cicilline in the past. Microsoft has recently censored terms offensive to the Chinese Communist Party, including \"Tiananmen Square\" and \"tank man,\" from its search engine Bing. It also banned discussion of the \"lab leak\" hypothesis from LinkedIn, the social networking platform it owns.

Darrell Issa / Getty Images Santi Ruiz June 23, 2021 image/svg+xml Rep. Darrell Issa (R., Calif.) on Wednesday slammed a package of bills that would empower regulators to go after tech monopolies, calling it \"an unprecedented expansion of big government.\" Issa\u2019s comments followed a lengthy House Judiciary Committee markup of five bipartisan antitrust bills targeting tech companies including Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon. The bills would bar most mergers and acquisitions by these companies and charge the Federal Trade Commission with more aggressive oversight of anti-competitive behavior. According to Issa, these bills give regulators undue power without addressing the real problem with tech companies. \"This legislative approach sidesteps the singular Big Tech crisis of our time: the relentless targeting of Americans\u2019 free speech and daily censorship of conservatives online,\" Issa told the Washington Free Beacon. Republicans are increasingly split on how to regulate big tech companies. Some, like Issa and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), focus primarily on censorship. Others\u2014including Rep. Ken Buck (R., Colo.), who cosponsored all five bills\u2014believe lawmakers should focus on fighting big tech\u2019s anti-competitive practices. Republican critics worry that the bipartisan package would give the Biden administration undue regulatory power. Issa warned in a memo that the rules could extend to large companies beyond big tech. But liberal and libertarian critics have attacked from the opposite side, saying the bills single out successful U.S. companies for punishment. The Progressive Policy Institute\u2019s Alec Stapp said \"the subcommittee bills target big tech firms instead of probing economic concentration across the U.S. economy.\" Rep. Chip Roy (R., Texas) supported the bills but said he was \"conflicted\" over giving the FTC more power to choose its targets. During the markup, Roy called for an amendment that would ban the FTC from selectively enforcing policies based on race. The amendment received full Republican backing but was defeated by Democrats. The legislative package has split longtime conservative allies in Washington, D.C. Mike Davis, a longtime Republican operative and big tech critic, called McCarthy and Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) \"antitrust paper tigers\" for opposing the package. Meanwhile, the Heritage Foundation denounced the bill, warning of a \"Big Tech-federal government nexus.\" During the markup, Buck defended the FTC, saying, \"This agency is tasked with something that is essential, something that President Trump and others have talked about \u2026 and that is to rein in big tech.\" Published under: Big Tech , Darrell Issa , FTC Issa Slams Bipartisan Big Tech Package for Ignoring Censorship California Republican says bills 'sidestep' censorship of conservatives MacKenzie Scott Sends Millions to Terror-Tied Nonprofit Network Bring in More Prosecutors: Finally Ending Minnesota\u2019s \u2018Never-Ending\u2019 Somali Fraud Schemes Requires Reinforcements Take My Governor\u2014Please Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Prepared To Flee to Moscow if Regime Loses Control Walz Drops Reelection Bid as Minnesota Reels From Massive Welfare Fraud Issa Slams Bipartisan Big Tech Package for Ignoring Censorship Politics Trump Resolves the Maduro Problem The Foreign Policy Winners and Losers of 2025 As Europe Steps Back, Asia Steps Up Newsletters Morning Beacon Rep.

Kendi's book to Virginia public school students as part of a program to promote black authors, according to emails between Amazon and school district officials. The emails show Amazon employees reached out to Arlington Public Schools as part of \"NeighborGood,\" a program to donate $100,000 to schools and other institutions that \"empower black voices and serve black communities.\" Despite Amazon's offer to purchase Kindles or other equipment, Arlington Public Schools director of diversity and inclusion Arron Gregory requested copies of Kendi's Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You . Amazon donated between 500-600 copies of the book to Wakefield High School and paid $10,000 to have Kendi's coauthor Jason Reynolds address students. Asra Nomani, vice president of Parents Defending Education, the watchdog group that obtained the emails through a public records request, called Amazon's prioritization of \"antiracism\" efforts during a pandemic \"shortsighted\" in a statement to the Washington Free Beacon. \"Instead of donating Kindles and hot spots to students in Arlington Public Schools, Amazon chose to spread the controversial ideology of critical race theory,\" Nomani said. \"The shortsighted decisions during a pandemic, with so many students vulnerable, reflect the national crisis of school districts circumventing parents to indoctrinate students\u2014in this case, with the help of corporate America.\" Purchasing Kendi's book was one of Amazon's many Black History Month initiatives. The company also promoted work by black authors and created an \"Amplify Black Voices\" channel on Prime Video. Amazon came under fire for removing a top-rated documentary about Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas during Black History Month. The film was number one on Amazon's documentary list before it was pulled, and Amazon has refused to explain the move. Stamped is billed as a young adult \"remix\" of Kendi's Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America. Kendi, who also wrote the commercially successful How to Be An Antiracist , has become a lightning rod in the national debate over critical race theory. Amazon public relations manager Justin Grayson oversaw the donation of Kendi's book and an accompanying study guide to Wakefield High School. The guide explains how Stamped \"debunks the myths of several master narrative themes,\" including the notion that \"America is a meritocracy\" and that \"truth and justice (or law and order) should be valued.\" Amazon found a willing partner for its \"antiracism\" push in Arlington Public Schools, which has poured resources into \"antiracist\" training. The district required teachers to undergo equity training last fall, during which educators learned how to create an \"actively antiracist learning environment.\" In an email to parents following the conviction of Derek Chauvin, Arlington superintendent Francisco Duran promoted resources from Learning for Justice, the educational arm of the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center. Asked for comment, Arlington Public Schools spokesman Frank Bellavia directed the Free Beacon to Amazon, which did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon isn't the only tech giant using book drives to boost \"antiracism\" efforts in elementary and high school classrooms. YouTube partnered with The Conscious Kid , an education and policy nonprofit set out to \"disrupt racism in kids,\" to develop a playlist of videos for children \"to counter anti-blackness and amplify black authors and stories.\" Google has also partnered with the group, which donated 120,000 \"antiracist\" books to thousands of schools across the United States in the 2020-21 school year.

Despite their limited numbers, recurring Facebook bans, and general disconnection with the rest of the hard left, their commitment to creating a colonized people\u2019s paradise in the Rockies appears unshaken. Although they\u2019re not taken seriously by other activist groups on the left, they take themselves seriously. It\u2019s unclear whether that self-belief will be enough to sustain them in their latest project. Hammer City, which was announced to widespread mockery on Twitter, will be situated on an undisclosed 200-acre plot in Colorado. The compound will last thousands of years, say the Black Hammers: \"After 600 years of struggle against colonialism, genocide, torture, and ecocide, the land is in the hands of The Colonized Working Class.\" https://twitter.com/BlkHmmrTimes/status/1389229760392409095?s=20 Surprisingly, the Hammers agreed to an interview with the Washington Free Beacon . In a Zoom call, \"Commander in Chief\" Gazi and \"Secretary General\" Anco appear in a small room, flanked by five bodyguard Hammers in matching masks. Gazi and Anco don\u2019t wear masks. Gazi likes to appear on Facebook live rallies with at least two bodyguards looming in the background, but it\u2019s unclear why they\u2019re on our private video call. Gazi refuses to introduce them, and they maintain their silent stance throughout our call. Gazi can\u2019t decide whether to butter me up or call me a cracker. After his \"political director\" confirms the Free Beacon \u2019s readership tends to be right-leaning, Gazi opens our call with a 10-minute denunciation of the recent \"rigged\" election, \"Barack Obummer,\" \"Kopmalla Harris,\" and so on. But then I ask about the planned commune, and Gazi gets upset. \"Hammer City was conceptualized by the poor colonized working class,\" says Anco. The \"United Snakes of Amerikkka\" is collapsing, they say, and the time is ripe for colonized \"dictatorship\" over the land. That land appears to be mountainous, rather rocky scrubland, and outside observers have raised questions about livability. But the Hammers are convinced they will be able to farm enough food and graze sizable herds to feed the commune on one acre (the rest, they say, will be preserved for nature). \"White people are so stupid!\" says Gazi when I put these doubts to him. \"Colonized people can live anywhere on earth, sweetie.\" Asking for details about the commune is fraught in part because the Black Hammers don\u2019t appear to have any background in homesteading. A self-described \"faggot from Atlanta,\" Gazi Kodzo is a YouTuber and radio show host who earned the moniker Black Hitler for his aggressively anti-white and anti-Semitic videos. In 2017, he served a short stint as campaign manager for a city council candidate, Eritha \"Akil\u00e9\" Cainion, in St. Petersburg, Florida. Cainion ran on an aggressive reparations platform that included \"restoring\" large swaths of St. Petersburg to a \"vibrant black community.\" But with the Hammers, Gazi seems to have found a long-term home for his particular brand of political performance. The bodyguard roleplaying is a testament to Gazi\u2019s remarkable hold over the group. The Hammers as an organization take after their leader: simultaneously vampy, brooding, and obsessed with the haters. In Facebook rallies, Gazi gets a splashy drumroll intro before bursting into the shot with two bodyguards, one holding a hammer (there is a conspicuous lack of guns in Hammer public displays). \"Land back!\" he cries. All Hammer speeches, from Gazi on down, begin with this phrase, a quasi-religious invocation. Gazi\u2019s speeches are hyperfocused on the criticism Hammers have received over the preceding week. Typically, the targets are white \"colonizer\" liberals and \"ku klux kkkomunists.\" As Gazi emphasizes on Twitter, \"If y\u2019all were communists, you\u2019d be back in europe, not on stolen land doing the work of the devil day in and day out.\" He adds a tea-sipping gif. But these days, focus has shifted to building anti-colonial power in the Rockies. As part of their outreach program, the Hammers are papering the South Side of Chicago with flyers urging residents to pick up and move to Hammer City. Gazi refuses to say how many people are in the Hammers. He claims there are 100 members of the governing cadre, representing Turtle Island (North America), Pachamama (South America), and the other four inhabited continents, and that there are far more rank and file members. Hammers representatives refuse to verify these statements, or claims that there are Stanford, Harvard, and MIT-educated Hammers, or that researchers from \"major universities\" have verified the high quality of Hammer City\u2019s soil. Then we get into the Hammers\u2019 racial politics, where no white person is left off the hook. Gazi has made the phrase \"Fuck Anne Frank\" a key attention generator in online videos . I ask about Frank, the Jewish girl whose diary captured some of the horrors of the Holocaust, toward the end of our conversation. Gazi describes her as an \"Easy-Bake Oven litt"

In a letter to CEO Tim Cook, members of the Apple Muslim Association on Monday expressed their \"sadness, anger, frustration, and disappointment\" about \"the struggle and pain of the Palestinian people, and their decades-long existence under military occupation.\" The letter calls on Apple to support the Palestinian cause, noting that the company \"has led the way not only on products, but on human rights issues.\" The employees, however, have yet to speak out about the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China, where Apple\u2019s supply chain is largely located. Up to one million Uyghurs are imprisoned in \"reeducation camps\" in the western province of Xinjiang. A recent report found photo and documentary evidence that seven Apple suppliers use Uyghur forced labor to make iPhone parts. More than 1,000 Apple employees have signed the letter, which boasts that Apple employees \"reached out to support and will continue to support our Asian communities in the face of anti-Asian hate and attacks.\" The letter also notes that Apple employees \"will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our Black and Brown communities in their fight for justice and equity.\" The signatories demand Apple not use the words \"conflict\" or \"clash\" to describe the fighting in Gaza, \"as those words imply a power symmetry that simply does not exist.\" The letter similarly demands Apple refrain from commenting on \"both sides\" of the conflict in Gaza, \"as doing so would feel to us as the equivalent of \u2018all lives matter\u2019\u2014a minimization of the disproportionately larger pain and suffering of the Palestinian people.\" Workers at other tech companies have also called on their employers to formally condemn Israel. On Wednesday, a group of \"Jewish and allied\" Google employees called on the company to formally terminate its contracts with the Israel Defense Forces.

In a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, 250 members of the Jewish Diaspora in Tech group called on the company to \"heed the requests framed by Palestinian Googlers and center their voices going forward.\" The letter also asks Google to fund Palestinian relief organizations, \"recognize the pain\" of Palestinians in a formal statement, and \"reject any definition of antisemitism that holds that criticism of Israel or Zionism is antisemitic.\" The letter comes as Israel weathers ongoing attacks from Hamas, which has bombarded Israel with thousands of rockets. Google came under fire earlier this week after its subsidiary YouTube twice banned a video defending Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. The Washington Free Beacon reported that YouTube blamed the censorship on the shoddy technology the company has adopted during the coronavirus pandemic.

In a letter to CEO Jeff Bezos first reported by The Verge , Amazon employees call for the company to terminate a $1.2 billion contract with the Israeli government. Over 500 employees have signed the letter, which asks \"Amazon leadership to acknowledge the continued assault upon Palestinians' basic human rights under an illegal occupation.\" Employees at major tech companies also publicly denounced Israel as it launched counterstrikes against Hamas terrorists in Gaza. Workers at Apple and Google sent letters to corporate leaders asking them to condemn and cut ties with Israel. All three letters reflect a growing interest from Silicon Valley workers in using corporate power to weigh in on geopolitical issues. The Amazon letter calls on the company to avoid \"using language that implies a power symmetry or situational equivalency\" between Israel and Hamas terrorists. The letter also demands that Amazon \"commit to spending equitable time and effort to learn about and engage with the Palestinian community,\" language pulled directly from the Apple employee letter. The signatories claim Amazon is \"erasing\" its Palestinian workers by not putting out a statement on the conflict. Tech employee groups have used similar tactics to lobby against engagement with the U.S. military. Google caved to employee pressure in 2018 when it declined to renew an AI contract with the Department of Defense called Project Maven . The tactic has also worked in personnel decisions.

The Washington Free Beacon reported Monday that YouTube twice removed a clip of George Mason University law professor Eugene Kontorovich discussing the legal status of Israeli strikes in Gaza. The second time, YouTube informed Kontorovich that his clip violated the platform's \"violent criminal organizations\" policy, which YouTube typically invokes to take down terrorist hostage or recruitment videos. But on Tuesday, YouTube told the Free Beacon that \"automated systems\" were to blame for how the video was handled. \"As part of our response to COVID-19, we are temporarily relying more on technology to help with some of the work normally done by reviewers. In this case, automated systems removed content that did not violate our policies, and we worked to quickly reinstate it.\" YouTube and Facebook, among other big tech platforms, say they are forced to rely on machine learning algorithms to deal with the flood of material on their platforms. But those systems often result in content being removed inappropriately. Occasionally, social media users will band together to flag posts as inappropriate in order to trick automatic moderating systems into removing legitimate content. It is unclear whether anyone reported Kontorovich's video to YouTube. Kontorovich alleged that taking down the video for 24 hours during wartime was part of \"a major campaign to portray\" Israeli defense efforts \"as illegal and in violation of the laws of war.\" In the clip, Kontorovich argued that Israeli strikes satisfied all international law requirements. Even before COVID, the machine learning algorithms tech companies billed as the solution to content moderation had to be supplemented by armies of laborers. For instance, reports from 2019 identified the web of Facebook's low-wage contractors in the Philippines who worked long hours sifting through videos of child abuse and violence, removing them by hand.

That policy bans \"content intended to praise, promote, or aid violent criminal organizations.\" Its listed examples of violations include hostage videos, propaganda produced by terrorists, and terror recruitment videos. The move continues a pattern of capricious moderation of content related to Israel from social media platforms. In April, the Chinese-owned platform TikTok hosted a series of viral videos of Arabs assaulting Orthodox Jews. Kontorovich told the Washington Free Beacon YouTube's decision demonstrated which groups have influence on the video platform. \"YouTube is obviously in thrall to the most extreme anti-Israel actors who want to silence academic discussion of international law in relation to Israel's actions, so that the blood libels will not be refuted,\" he said. According to Kontorovich, restoring the video would not be enough to combat what he sees as a battle for public opinion of Israel amid this ongoing conflict. He said there\u2019s \"a major campaign to portray\" Israeli defense efforts \"as illegal and in violation of the laws of war,\" and that silencing arguments like his are \"constraining Israel's ability to defend itself from Hamas.\" Updated 5/17/21 at 10:21 p.m. Published under: Gaza , Google , Israel , TikTok , YouTube YouTube Removes Video of Legal Scholar Defending Israeli Airstrikes MacKenzie Scott Sends Millions to Terror-Tied Nonprofit Network Bring in More Prosecutors: Finally Ending Minnesota\u2019s \u2018Never-Ending\u2019 Somali Fraud Schemes Requires Reinforcements Take My Governor\u2014Please Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Prepared To Flee to Moscow if Regime Loses Control Walz Drops Reelection Bid as Minnesota Reels From Massive Welfare Fraud YouTube Removes Video of Legal Scholar Defending Israeli Airstrikes Politics Trump Resolves the Maduro Problem The Foreign Policy Winners and Losers of 2025 As Europe Steps Back, Asia Steps Up Newsletters Morning Beacon"

The original publisher, Simon & Schuster, dropped the book amid the January 6 riots and the Missouri Republican\u2019s insistence on contesting the 2020 election results. Now snatched up by conservative publisher Regnery, it\u2019s selling well\u2014the latest example of cancel culture\u2019s Streisand effect . In form and structure, Tyranny mirrors a recent book on the same topic by Hawley\u2019s Antitrust Committee colleague and chairwoman, Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar. Antitrust ( reviewed in these pages), also tried to frame vigorous antitrust as recovering an American tradition shared by Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and Teddy Roosevelt, among others. The two books also share a few political prescriptions. Both senators critique the \"Chicago School\" of antitrust theory, which takes a friendly view of most mergers. Both, in their own ways, emphasize the dangers of corporate size in itself, even before they address specific harms caused by large companies. But they differ in whom exactly they want to target. While Klobuchar is a critic of corporate power generally, Hawley knows exactly whom he wants to go after: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Google (Twitter, though much smaller, comes in for some heat as well). The book\u2019s greatest strength is also its weakness: Hawley genuinely thinks these companies cause more harm than good and doesn\u2019t shy away from saying so. Tyranny doesn\u2019t vacillate, but it also comes off at times as shortsighted, unwilling to flesh out an approach to big tech companies that might also implicate other nefarious corporate actors. Hawley\u2019s \"corporate barons\" are the inheritors of the Gilded Age robber barons, except these corporate barons don\u2019t even create real physical things. \"[T]oday\u2019s tech oligarchs wield immense power, thanks to a combination of government aid and monopoly; like the barons, they are utterly convinced of their own righteousness and their right to govern America.\" The book\u2019s main targets are the attention economy these oligarchs created and their censorious behavior. In Hawley\u2019s reading of the big tech economic model, users are \"sources of information to be mined\" for as long as possible. As a result of this shift, we increasingly see a new hierarchy of jobs, with the digital world of content creation reigning over the real-world labors of the \"Jeffersonian middle class.\" Hawley suggests that this world of \"modern horrors\" has been foisted on American citizens, who otherwise wouldn\u2019t choose constant invasions of their privacy. For Hawley, this paradigm is fundamentally dangerous to a republican mode of governance, both because it turns citizens into consumptive drones and because it allows tech to monopolize the flow of information. Jon Askonas points out that Hawley\u2019s targets are disseminators of information, rather than companies like Microsoft, which have tremendous market power in other domains. Hawley is less concerned with unaccountable corporations generally, and more concerned with \"corporate liberalism,\" specifically the ideological valence of the platforms that censor speech. It\u2019s a book short on trade-offs. Hawley correctly brings up the shocking censorship of political dissents Facebook engages in, but many observers believe his proposed solution (Section 230 reform) would mean a massive spike in just this kind of censorship. The antitrust arguments in Tyranny are also rather confusing to follow, as Hawley both criticizes the dangers of the attention economy and complains that monopolies make it harder for competitors to thrive in the same morally questionable businesses. The policy prescriptions he outlines vary from reasonable to misguided. Hawley believes our current standard for \"market power\" in antitrust law is too limited: He\u2019s appalled that the law doesn\u2019t look closer at Facebook\u2019s 83 percent share of consumers\u2019 time spent on social media, for instance. At other points, he lambasts platform features like autoplay or sorting by relevance, which plenty of social media users find valuable. Perhaps Hawley\u2019s most aggressive proposal is to eliminate Section 230 protections for any company that engages in behavioral advertising (that is, all of them). According to Hawley, \"behavioral ads drive many of tech platforms\u2019 worst pathologies\u2014the surveillance, the addiction race, the data pilfering.\" The move would break big tech platforms completely, and Hawley suggests that outcome wouldn\u2019t be so bad. In the most intriguing passages, Hawley suggests a kind of alternate history for tech, in which different legal principles at the dawn of the internet age could have created a decentralized internet, free of coercion or censorship. But this slim volume doesn\u2019t discuss the flowering of decentralized social media or internet applications happening now\u2014one wonders what the senator has to say about Discord, Bluesky, or cryptocurrency. Tyranny lays out a program that would cut off big tech companies at the knees. But whether Americans care enough about targeted advertising, censorship, and the perils of the attention economy to endorse this program is another question. If Hawley is right, and we have been turned from citizens to consumers and inputs into the big data machine, it may be too late for his suite of solutions.

China critic Peter Humphrey, who lives in the United Kingdom, was locked out of his account and saw that his comments calling China an \"oppressive dictatorship\" had been removed, according to a Bloomberg report Tuesday. LinkedIn originally told Humphrey that he had violated the platform's terms of service but now says the removal was \"an error.\" It is unclear whether the Chinese government pressured the platform to remove Humphrey's content. LinkedIn is the only major American social media network in China, where it censors users' content. The Chinese government has castigated LinkedIn for not sufficiently censoring certain political content. In March, the Cyberspace Administration of China blocked LinkedIn from accepting more users and made the company submit a report detailing its failures to the government. LinkedIn was founded in 2003 by Reid Hoffman, a Democratic megadonor who contributed at least $1 million to President Biden's campaign. In 2016, Hoffman sold the company to Microsoft, which has maintained a decades-long relationship with China. Microsoft president Brad Smith aggravated lawmakers in September 2020 by defending Chinese tech giant Huawei from national-security scrutiny. Smith has avoided weighing in on the LinkedIn controversy. Hoffman, who serves on Microsoft's board, did not respond to a request for comment. LinkedIn has tried to walk a fine line in its public statements, telling users whose content has been banned in China that \"we strongly support freedom of expression.\" Reached for comment, LinkedIn spokeswoman Leonna Spilman said, \"Our team reviewed the action, based on our appeals process, and found it was an error. This is unrelated to the issue we corrected in 2019.\" This is the second time LinkedIn has gone after Humphrey. In 2019, Humphrey's profile was blocked in China. LinkedIn restored his profile once the story became public and said the profile had been blocked in error. Humphrey is a well-known critic of the Chinese government and was imprisoned in China for 23 months for \"illegally acquiring personal information,\" charges he calls false and invented. Humphrey was filmed on China Central Television, a state broadcaster, giving a forced confession of guilt. The censorship of content like Humphrey's may be the cost of doing business in China. LinkedIn expanded its operations in the country even after Beijing hacked the company's systems, the Washington Free Beacon reported in March.

Facebook is warning users that articles describing evidence for the theory are \"Missing Context\" and is steering them to a 2020 fact-check saying there is little evidence for a non-natural origin of the virus. Wade\u2019s story is accompanied on Facebook by a link to an April 2020 fact-check . The fact-check, which is riddled with grammatical errors, quotes two academic articles and five scientists on Twitter who believe the theory is false. Reached for comment, a spokesperson directed the Washington Free Beacon to Facebook\u2019s COVID policies . Those policies ban content that claims COVID was manufactured or bioengineered. It\u2019s the latest example of Facebook\u2019s aggressive approach to content moderation. The lab leak hypothesis became a political flashpoint when senior Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers voiced concerns about a lab in Wuhan that worked with coronaviruses. Though mainstream media outlets called the hypothesis a conspiracy theory, the theory is gaining traction as efforts to pinpoint the virus\u2019s natural origin founder . Wade\u2019s Medium piece outlining the circumstantial evidence for the lab leak hypothesis received widespread attention when it was posted on the popular blogging platform last week. Wade\u2019s piece temporarily disappeared from the site on Tuesday afternoon, although at press time it had been restored. Medium did not respond to requests for comment. Medium\u2019s rules on COVID-19 content explicitly ban \"conspiracy claims\" that COVID was \"engineered in a lab.\" They also ban references to COVID as a \"far-reaching conspiracy or cover-up.\" Facebook acknowledges its practice of limiting the reach of content that it finds objectionable, including content its fact-checkers label False or Partly False. Facebook did not respond to requests for comment on whether it artificially limits the reach content it labels as \"Missing Context.\" An examination of accounts that had posted the article showed significantly lower engagement with the story than with other stories posted in the same time period. In its recent ruling on former president Donald Trump\u2019s ban from the platform, Facebook\u2019s Oversight Board endorsed the use of downranking to avoid \"amplifying speech\" that doesn\u2019t meet its standards. Scientists and intelligence agencies are still investigating the origins of the virus. No one has managed to disprove theories saying the virus originated in a Chinese lab, yet companies like Facebook and Medium are attempting to limit debate. Facebook previously limited the reach of a New York Post report on Hunter Biden, which the platform falsely labeled as \"misinformation.\" Chuck Ross contributed to this report.

A month later, the tech giant was found to have relied on Chinese slave labor to build parts for its tech products. Apple moved production of its upcoming drama Emancipation to Louisiana after star Will Smith and director Antoine Fuqua said they could not support a state that \"enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access.\" But this week, The Information released a report naming seven Apple suppliers that rely on the forced labor of Uyghurs. Apple is the latest corporation to suspend business in protest of a law that added requirements for absentee ballots. House majority whip Jim Clyburn and President Biden have referred to the law as a \"new Jim Crow.\" But Apple's continued reliance on forced labor raises questions about the company's dedication to human rights. According to The Information , one of Apple's suppliers is based in Xinjiang, where up to 1 million members of the Uyghur Muslim ethnic minority have been detained in \"reeducation\" camps. Multiple reports have detailed torture and forced sterilizations in the camps. The report is not the first to document Apple's reliance on forced labor. In March 2020, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found that some Apple suppliers were required to provide political indoctrination to Uyghur laborers. Other Apple suppliers are not based in Xinjiang, but records show that workers were shipped from Xinjiang to their plants. Avary Holdings, which makes circuit boards for Apple, received 400 Xinjiang workers at one of its factories. Shenzen Deren Electronic, which makes internal cables, received 1,000 workers. According to The Information , a video produced by a fourth supplier outlines how it used forced labor in 2018 and 2019. Apple, along with Nike and Coca-Cola, has lobbied extensively against a bill that would create stricter penalties for companies caught using forced labor. The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act would make operating Chinese supply chains more difficult for these multinational corporations. Apple bought the film rights to Emancipation in 2020 for $130 million. The film is based on true events featuring the subject of a famous Civil War-era photograph who displayed the web of scars on his back. Apple has denied relying on forced labor in the past and did not respond to requests for comment.

Mike Lee (R., Utah) and Rep. Ken Buck (R., Colo.) on Tuesday asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Amazon for violating federal law while competing for a Department of Defense contract. The lawmakers in a letter said Amazon may have bribed a senior defense official in order to secure a cloud computing contract, citing an alleged payment from an Amazon consultant to a top adviser to former secretary of defense James Mattis, Sally Donnelly. Lee and Buck, citing an April 2020 inspector general report , say Donnelly received more than $1 million in undisclosed payments from an Amazon consultant during her time at the Defense Department. While the payments were officially for the 2017 sale of her consulting company, Donnelly reported only $390,000 from that sale. Lee and Buck allege the payment came in exchange for her willingness to promote Amazon in her official capacity at the Defense Department. Donnelly had done consulting work for Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services, Amazon Web Services (AWS). She is now a member of the isolationist Quincy Institute\u2019s board of directors. Amazon\u2019s alleged misbehavior came to light in a 2018 dossier released by a private investigative firm, Rosetti Starr, which publicized the accusations. The Defense Department's inspector general found no evidence of wrongdoing by either Donnelly or Mattis, but Lee and Buck suggested that finding was inadequate. The accusations have received attention as a growing segment of the GOP looks for new tools , including Justice Department investigations, to rein in big tech companies. Lee and Buck said Amazon\u2019s behavior was \"anticompetitive,\" suggesting \"Amazon may have attempted to monopolize one or more markets\" with the contract. The contract in question, the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure program, or JEDI, was designed to pull all military data onto one platform. It is reportedly worth up to $10 billion and was ultimately awarded to Microsoft. In the letter to Garland, Lee and Buck allege, \"While serving as a senior DoD official and receiving undisclosed payments ... Ms. Donnelly wrote e-mail correspondence to other senior DoD officials\" recommending Amazon\u2019s services. The lawmakers further allege that Donnelly organized dinners attended by Mattis, Jeff Bezos, and Amazon-funded consultants. The letter also names defense official Anthony DeMartino, who worked as an Amazon consultant with Donnelly and \"played an integral role in drafting directives regarding the Department\u2019s cloud acquisition strategy.\" DeMartino may have participated in meetings regarding the Pentagon's cloud acquisition, despite being told to recuse himself by the Defense Department's ethics office, the letter says. The investigation is the latest effort by lawmakers to investigate Amazon's anticompetitive behavior. The retail giant has drawn criticism for banning conservative books on its platform and for kicking a conservative social media site off of AWS. Amazon is suing the Defense Department for awarding the contract to Microsoft, arguing that then-President Trump was biased against Amazon and Bezos.

The widely anticipated decision will set a precedent for Facebook's moderation of political speech. Republicans have criticized the platform for censoring conservative voices, and world leaders worried that banning Trump would endanger public discourse. German chancellor Angela Merkel said Trump's bans from social media were \"problematic\" and emphasized that \"the right to freedom of opinion is of fundamental importance.\" The board's decision may have a cascading effect on other platforms that banned Trump, such as Twitter, YouTube, and Snapchat. Oversight Board cochair and former Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt has said she hopes the Oversight Board will be so successful that other social media platforms use its decisions to guide their own content moderation. In addition to issuing a binding decision on this specific case, the board will also make nonbinding suggestions for broader policies on public figures. Facebook has adjusted its rules in the past based on Trump's behavior. In 2015, after keeping up a video from then-candidate Trump calling for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, Facebook announced a \"newsworthiness\" exception, which allows for posts that violate its policies if they have news value. In a recent interview with the Washington Free Beacon , board member Michael McConnell avoided speaking specifically about the Trump case but emphasized that one of the board's major goals is to outline clear rules for moderating the speech of public figures. Some observers have expressed concern that, even if the board rules that Trump must be allowed back on the platform, Facebook will use other tools to shape political discourse. In a recent interview, tech mogul and Facebook board member Peter Thiel warned that \"the real problem\" is the \"downranking\" of content Facebook finds objectionable, so that it is posted but users see it less often. Neither Trump nor Facebook has any way to appeal the board's decision.

Facebook banned Trump from the platform on Jan. 7, following the Capitol riots. At the time, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the risks of allowing the president to continue using the platform were \"simply too great.\" McConnell would not comment on upcoming cases. The Oversight Board is expected to rule on Facebook's decision in the next two weeks. A former U.S. circuit judge who now teaches constitutional law at Stanford Law School, McConnell is one of 20 Oversight Board members who determine whether content Facebook bans must stay up. The board has ruled on a handful of cases since it was established last year and has tended to criticize Facebook's restrictive misinformation policies. McConnell said the rules are \"vague and hard to understand\" for users. He also emphasized the Oversight Board's focus on bringing consistency to Facebook's application of standards, which thus far have been \"ad hoc and inconsistent.\" But McConnell stressed that solving the problem would be difficult since \"it's extremely difficult to write a rule that solves the misinformation problem.\" McConnell tried to manage expectations for the board, saying, \"I'm optimistic about us being able to do things a little bit better.\" And he said that censorship by the social media giant was \"not necessarily a bad thing\" when in support of \"clearly articulated values.\" Those comments point to a tension at the heart of Facebook's Oversight Board initiative. Facebook has described the board as an external body that will function like the Supreme Court, ruling on specific cases and creating a body of case law that guides how the company implements rules. But Facebook's terms of service and \"governing values\" offer little guidance for tough cases. As McConnell pointed out, the Oversight Board is both expected to defend free speech and censor content that clashes with Facebook's values. And McConnell noted that the board is expected to draw on both American and international free speech standards when making its decisions. Members of the board disagree regularly on how to reconcile competing values, McConnell said. The Oversight Board recently gave users the ability to petition for content to be taken down. McConnell described that shift as a natural evolution of the board's work. But the move suggests the board may be less of a pro-free speech body than it has been in its first year of existence. McConnell did not deny those concerns but said he was not worried that the move could lead to more restrictions on content. McConnell also dismissed concerns that the board was an unaccountable body. He claims that the board is accountable because its decisions are published with full rationales and are \"available for public commentary.\" But McConnell questioned the value of accountability for the board at all, saying about public pressure, \"I hope it only shapes us insofar as the commentary is cogent and correct.\" McConnell said, \"I don't want the board to simply be responsive to large numbers of people shouting angrily over social media.\" At one point during the interview, McConnell described Facebook as a near-monopoly. He then clarified, \"I don't mean near-monopoly status in any antitrust sense, just in the sense of a platform so many people use indispensably,\" and noted that \"it's hard to communicate to a large audience without Facebook.\" Published under: Censorship , Donald Trump , Facebook , First Amendment , Free Speech , Social Media"

The poll asked 2,500 people aged 18-29 how often they trusted major institutions to \"do the right thing.\" Only 19 percent of respondents said they trusted Facebook to do the right thing all or most of the time, and 21 percent said the same about Twitter. Only Wall Street scored as poorly as the social media sites. Other institutions polled surprisingly well. Nearly half of respondents said they trusted the U.S. military to do the right thing \"all or most of the time,\" while 47 percent said the same of the Supreme Court. Forty-five percent of young people said they trusted the police to do the right thing all or most of the time. Young Americans\u2019 trust in the Supreme Court and the police cuts against typical media portrayals of the political climate. Efforts to pack the Court or abolish the police are generally presented as popular among young voters. According to the poll, only 22 percent of young people trust the media to do the right thing all or most of the time. The poll highlights a growing sense of unease with social media platforms. Although young respondents tended to say that social media had a positive impact on their ability to \"express their political voice,\" they also tended to say it had a negative impact on American democracy and their mental health. Young people strongly favor greater regulation of speech online, with 68 percent of those polled saying social media platforms should remove misleading claims. A majority (52 percent) believed Twitter\u2019s ban on former president Donald Trump was necessary. The poll also documents striking levels of depression among young people. Fifty-one percent reported feeling \"down, depressed, or hopeless\" in the past few days, and 68 percent reported \"feeling tired or having little energy.\" Twenty-eight percent said they had thought about hurting themselves in some way several times during the last two weeks.

(Photo by Ahmad GHARABLI / AFP) (Photo by AHMAD GHARABLI/AFP via Getty Images) Santi Ruiz April 23, 2021 image/svg+xml Videos depicting anti-Semitic violence are trending on TikTok in Israel, encouraging Arab assaults on Jews amid ongoing violent protests in Jerusalem. The videos, which show Arab teens assaulting unsuspecting Jews, have stoked violent conflicts in the Old City of Jerusalem. Tensions came to a head Thursday night as the far-right Jewish group Lehava organized a street march in protest, chanting \"death to Arabs.\" TikTok began removing anti-Semitic videos Friday. The popular social media company has come under fire for censoring content critical of the Chinese Communist Party. TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, is a Chinese tech giant. Fights broke out in Jerusalem earlier this week after Israeli police blocked Palestinians from congregating at Damascus Gate, a popular spot for evening prayers during Ramadan. The brawls intensified after the release of a TikTok showing Arab teens assaulting an Orthodox Jewish man on the Jerusalem light rail. On Thursday night, the clashes between Jewish and Arab protesters roiled the Old City of Jerusalem, injuring over 100 people. Police arrested more than 50 people for throwing rocks and assaulting police. According to police, protesters on both sides set trash cans on fire. Videos showed beatings of unarmed Jews as well as police breaking up groups from Lehava with riot grenades. This is not TikTok\u2019s first brush with anti-Semitism. Users with symbols of Judaism in their bios report being inundated with anti-Semitic comments. In July 2020, a song mocking Holocaust victims went viral on the app, and videos with the song were viewed millions of times. TikTok eventually removed the video and reiterated its commitment to user safety. While anti-Semitic content proliferates on the app, TikTok also frequently censors criticism of the Chinese government. Documents leaked to the Guardian in 2019 revealed TikTok maintained internal policies of banning videos that advocate greater freedom for Tibet or that reference Tiananmen Square or the pro-independence group Falun Gong. Observers believe TikTok censored videos supportive of protests against the regime in Hong Kong. The platform similarly censors videos that mention the oppression of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Many Uyghurs who have used TikTok to share their plight found their accounts shuttered soon after. Users also suspect the app\u2019s algorithm promotes pro-China content. In the summer of 2020, many users with low follower counts saw their views skyrocket after creating tongue-in-cheek \"ilovechina\" videos with the Chinese flag prominently featured. TikTok\u2019s ties to the Chinese government are well-known. The Justice Department alleged that ByteDance\u2019s founder has shown he is \"committed to promoting\" the agenda of the Chinese Communist Party, and that the company employs 130 party members in its Beijing office.

Companies like Facebook use algorithms that target ads to narrow sets of consumers by processing huge quantities of data, including user activity, location, and facial recognition. Facebook has faced scrutiny for its micro-targeting tools, which let landlords market their apartments exclusively to white people and let employers target certain demographics for job postings. The FTC's statement, released on the agency's official blog, sets the stage for the first high-profile battle between the Biden administration and big tech. Big tech companies draw much of their revenue from advertising targeted to users' personal information. That function could be sharply curtailed if the FTC considers ad targeting discriminatory. The post cites laws that prohibit companies from using \"racially biased algorithms.\" The commission bans \"unfair or deceptive business practices,\" while other laws bar discrimination in credit or housing based on race or sex. The blog post's author, FTC staff attorney Elisa Jillson, warns companies that if they fail to hold themselves accountable, \"the FTC may do it for you.\" The FTC is one of several federal agencies that have begun investigating big tech algorithms. In December, the agency forced nine major social media companies to disclose how they target content to consumers. In 2019, the Department of Housing and Urban Development charged Facebook with discrimination for offering tools to help target ads that excluded \"women in the workforce, moms of grade school kids, foreigners, Puerto Rico Islanders,\" and others. Facebook in particular has received criticism for its opaque algorithms. Researchers at the University of Southern California found this week that the site disproportionately filters job postings based on user gender and \"learns and perpetuates\" existing bias. In February, a judge approved a $650 million settlement between Facebook and users whose faces it scanned and stored without permission. And the Supreme Court is refusing to block a suit that claims Facebook's trackers on third-party websites are illegal. Those trackers are a key tool for Facebook, allowing the site to integrate information about users browsing the web into its own algorithms. But the FTC may have trouble regulating big tech companies. \"You don't announce something like this in a blog post,'\u2019 American Enterprise Institute privacy scholar Jim Harper told the Washington Free Beacon . \"If they're saying what it looks like they're saying, it's a far bigger deal that should be carefully thought through.\" It's unclear how the FTC will put some of the language in its blog post, including the claim that it can challenge algorithms that \"do more harm than good,\" into operation. The FTC does not have clearly defined \"basic standards, benchmarks, and measurement tools\" for evaluating algorithms for bias, noted artificial intelligence researcher Jon Stokes, and neither does the broader artificial intelligence industry. FTC commissioner Rohit Chopra has expressed concern that the commission isn't ready or willing to take on major companies. In written testimony submitted for a congressional hearing Tuesday, Chopra warned that \"the FTC is unwilling to take meaningful accountability measures\" when companies like Google and Facebook repeatedly violate the law. Reached for comment, an FTC spokeswoman told the Free Beacon that \"combating algorithmic discrimination\" is a priority for acting FTC chairwoman Rebecca Kelly Slaughter.

In a petition to the National Labor Relations Board, the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (RWDSU) claimed Friday that Amazon told workers the warehouse would be closed if they unionized and that it disciplined workers for organizing. The complaint lists 23 total violations of labor law by Amazon. The unionization effort earned national attention , since workers at the Bessemer, Ala., warehouse would have been the first unionized Amazon employees. Democratic politicians, as well as some Republicans, used the effort to criticize Amazon for its outsized market power. Amazon has sparred with politicians on social media and lobbies heavily on the Hill, prompting concerns it is unaccountable to political pressure. The complaint highlights the lengths Amazon went to in order to restrict support for the union. The RWDSU alleges Amazon \"sent multiple messages to workers unlawfully threatening loss of business\" at the facility if they supported the union. Amazon also allegedly held mandatory anti-union meetings, in which workers who asked questions about the union were removed. Amazon\u2019s anti-union work extended beyond the workplace, according to the complaint. The company hired police officers to patrol the parking lot and observe union organizers, it says. And according to the union, Amazon successfully lobbied local officials to change the duration of a traffic light outside the warehouse, so organizers would have less time to talk to workers after work hours. \"Amazon has left no stone unturned in its efforts to gaslight its own employees,\" said RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum. In response, an Amazon spokesperson said, \"Rather than accepting these employees\u2019 choice, the union seems determined to continue misrepresenting the facts in order to drive its own agenda.\" Amazon has faced criticism in recent months for its editorial and business decisions. The retailer banned a bestselling book on transgender issues in March and made changes to requirements for small sellers that drove many Orthodox Jews from the platform.

James O\u2019Keefe, the founder of investigative site Project Veritas, was suspended shortly after posting a video of a CNN director describing his work as \"propaganda\" and boasting that the network \"got Trump out.\" Twitter claimed O\u2019Keefe was suspended for \"platform manipulation and spam,\" a vague allegation O\u2019Keefe denies. The ban comes as a growing number of politicians have called for increased government regulation of social media sites. Many Republicans are calling for changes to the laws that govern what content social media sites can bar from their platforms. Recent suspensions of conservative accounts have convinced many Republicans that Twitter\u2019s rules are a cover for ideologically motivated bans. Twitter recently simplified its rules, explaining that they had been \"long, complex, and rarely visible in our product.\" But the rules do little to explain certain violations. The rule against platform manipulation and spam, which O\u2019Keefe allegedly violated, reads only, \"You may not use Twitter\u2019s services in a way designed to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts people\u2019s experience on Twitter.\" Twitter did not explain how O'Keefe had violated this policy. Twitter and Facebook often use their privacy standards to justify censoring news stories. Journalist Jason Whitlock was locked out of his Twitter account on April 9 after criticizing a Black Lives Matter founder following a New York Post story about her ritzy house. Facebook has prevented users from sharing links to that story on its Messenger app. Both platforms claimed they were protecting private citizens from harassment. But neither social media site is consistent in the application of these standards. A quick search reveals Twitter allows the posting of full addresses of other private citizens, including an Army sergeant recently charged with assault. His family was forced to move after a mob gathered outside their home. Videos posted by protesters outside their home celebrating as the family escapes have been retweeted thousands of times. Facebook allows users to share multiple stories describing the precise locations of the homes of private individuals. Some Twitter users have found themselves banned without even a vague explanation. California Republican Party chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson was locked out of her Twitter account Monday morning due to suspicious activity. Despite filing appeals, Patterson has not been told what that activity was or been allowed to log back into her account. Twitter told the Washington Free Beacon, \"Our teams enforce our rules using a combination of human review and technology.\" Under the guise of public safety, Twitter has banned groups with specific political leanings. In January, Twitter updated its coordinated harmful activity policy and kicked off roughly 150,000 accounts for sharing \"Q-Anon associated content.\" The platform did not outline what constituted Q-Anon associated content. The QAnon ban swept up many accounts that did not appear to support the conspiracy theory. Although Twitter has maintained it uses a five-strike rule for determining when accounts should be permanently suspended, some of the suspended accounts say they received no warning before their suspensions. Some researchers worry the QAnon bans may lead to more radicalization. Although the dynamics of online radicalization are often unclear, one study found that when platforms deplatform radical groups, they limit their reach but may further radicalize group members.

Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) introduced a bill Wednesday aimed at reducing Chinese control over technology used by the Department of Defense and its contractors.

Democratic senators Bob Menendez (N.J.) and Tim Kaine (Va.) both called on Biden to lay out a clear policy approach toward China during his Wednesday night speech to Congress. The Protecting Critical Boards and Electronics Through Transparency and Enduring Reinvestment Act would designate federal funds to support American manufacturing of printed circuit boards. The American printed circuit board manufacturing market is valued at $2.7 billion, a third of what it was 20 years ago. The circuit boards are often designed in the United States but assembled in China, leaving American-made technology vulnerable to Chinese sabotage. \"Chinese printed circuit boards pose a serious threat to the integrity of America's defense systems,\" said Hawley. \"It is imperative that we give the Department of Defense the tools it needs to secure its printed circuit board supply chains, so that our warfighters can have full confidence in the weapons they rely on to protect our nation.\" China has a history of mounting cyberattacks against the U.S. government.

Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee distributed a memo as part of ranking member Cathy McMorris Rodgers's (R., Wash.) \"Big Tech Accountability Platform.\" The memo suggests a variety of ways that lawmakers can remove liability protections granted to tech platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Currently, Section 230 protects tech companies from lawsuits pertaining to the content shared on their platforms. Some conservatives argue repealing these protections would make it possible to sue social media sites for censoring conservatives. But others doubt whether limiting these protections would change how tech platforms act, since companies have a First Amendment right to host whatever speech they choose. The memo suggests limiting 230 protection to legally protected speech, creating an additional incentive for platforms to remove threatening or obscene content. Alternatively, the memo suggests only providing protection for companies that don\u2019t \"discriminate based on political affiliation or viewpoint.\" That suggestion will likely trigger debate over how to prove a company discriminates based on political affiliation. The document also proposes repealing 230 protections for companies that engage in \"targeted behavioral advertising.\" It\u2019s unclear how feasible such a reform would be. Currently, most ads served to Internet users are targeted to them in some capacity. Industry advocates have worried that allowing more lawsuits against social media companies would benefit large platforms over startups. The memo tries to alleviate these concerns, noting that its legislative suggestions would only apply to \"Big Tech companies with an annual revenue of $1 billion.\" House Republicans in favor of Section 230 reform will be bolstered by a recent opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In a case regarding President Joe Biden\u2019s ability to block Twitter users from his personal account, Thomas suggested that big tech companies should be treated like \"common carriers\" and barred from moderating content based on viewpoint. Conservatives at the state level have proposed similar restrictions, but a federal solution is likely to avoid the legal challenges those state attempts would face. While a growing number of Republicans are trying to curb the power of big tech platforms, Democrats have called on social media companies to more aggressively censor misinformation. In a March 25 House hearing, Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D., Ill.) demanded platforms be held accountable \"when they are used to incite violence and hatred\" or share misinformation about COVID-19.

Facebook created the Oversight Board in October 2020, in response to complaints that the social media giant was stifling free speech. The board was originally meant to determine whether content that Facebook had banned should stay up. Now, it will also be tasked with the reverse, determining whether content that Facebook has allowed to remain on the site should be removed. Facebook faces political pressure from the left to censor more content for misinformation. That pressure has escalated during the pandemic, as debates over expert opinion and vaccine safety have become more salient and tech companies have increased their efforts to control misinformation. Facebook users can already report inappropriate content and request that it be removed. This new process allows users to appeal to the Oversight Board if Facebook does not remove the flagged content. The board receives hundreds of thousands of cases and has freedom to choose which cases it hears. Its rulings are binding on Facebook. A source close to the Oversight Board told the Washington Free Beacon that the board had faced pressure at its inception from civil society groups that wanted Facebook to do more to limit misinformation on the platform. The board has described this move as a natural progression. The Oversight Board struck down a number of Facebook\u2019s decisions to ban content over the past year. But the expansion of the board\u2019s duties raises concerns that it may become another means by which Facebook removes content that conflicts with its values. In the coming weeks, the Oversight Board is expected to determine whether former president Donald Trump will be allowed back on Facebook. Trump was banned shortly after the Jan. 6 riot. The ruling will likely be a benchmark for how social media companies balance their competing goals of hosting speech while not being attacked for spreading misinformation. Testifying before the House Energy and Commerce Committee last month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called for more government regulation of social media sites. Many conservatives see the push for regulation as an attempt to silence dissenting voices.

Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who publicly backed the effort. The Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union, which organized the effort, said it would appeal the vote to the National Labor Relations Board, citing aggressive anti-union efforts by Amazon. But the vote is unlikely to be overturned, as workers voted 1,798 to 738 against unionizing. \"We won't let Amazon's lies, deception and illegal activities go unchallenged, which is why we are formally filing charges against all of the egregious and blatantly illegal actions taken by Amazon during the union vote,\" said union president Stuart Appelbaum on Friday. While none of Amazon's 1.3 million workers are unionized, Amazon maintains its pay and health care policies are better than those of its competitors. In a statement Friday, Sanders said he was \"disappointed but not surprised by the vote\" and suggested that \"some of Amazon's anti-union efforts may have been in violation of [National Labor Relations Board] law.\" Sanders praised Amazon workers in Alabama for \"their courage and willingness to stand up for workers' rights,\" calling them \"an inspiration to workers all across the country.\" In the lead-up to the vote, Amazon took a surprisingly aggressive line on social media, attacking Sanders for campaigning on behalf of the union. It also assailed Rep. Mark Pocan (D., Wis.) for referring to allegations that Amazon workers were forced to urinate in bottles to save time. Amazon later apologized for its attack on Pocan and tacitly admitted that many Amazon drivers report having to urinate in bottles. Some Republicans saw the union vote as an opportunity to punish Amazon for its recent censorship of conservative voices. In a USA Today op-ed , Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) called Amazon's opposition to the unionization effort \"inconsistent with the progressive values it has forced on everyone else.\" Amazon banned the sale of a bestselling book on the transgender movement last month and adjusted its policies to bar sales of any books that \"frame LGBTQ+ identity as a mental illness.\" Published under: Amazon , Jeff Bezos , Unions Bezos Beats Dem-Backed Union Effort in Alabama MacKenzie Scott Sends Millions to Terror-Tied Nonprofit Network Bring in More Prosecutors: Finally Ending Minnesota\u2019s \u2018Never-Ending\u2019 Somali Fraud Schemes Requires Reinforcements Take My Governor\u2014Please Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Prepared To Flee to Moscow if Regime Loses Control Walz Drops Reelection Bid as Minnesota Reels From Massive Welfare Fraud Bezos Beats Dem-Backed Union Effort in Alabama Politics Trump Resolves the Maduro Problem The Foreign Policy Winners and Losers of 2025 As Europe Steps Back, Asia Steps Up Newsletters Morning Beacon Jeff Bezos (Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images)"

Testifying at a March 25 House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg signaled his support for a number of legislative changes that would make social networking sites liable for illegal or illicit content published on their platforms. The proposed changes would increase the barrier to entry for new social media companies attempting to compete with Facebook by requiring them to build up units akin to Facebook's Security and Safety teams that police misinformation. Facebook's push for regulation comes as social media companies face increased pressure from both sides of the aisle. Democrats have attacked Facebook as a monopoly that does not do enough to combat disinformation, while many Republicans feel it already overly censors users. During the hearing, Zuckerberg endorsed legislation that would define \"misinformation\" and punish companies that allow ads containing misinformation on their sites. Zuckerberg also signaled his support for creating a federal agency to assess misinformation. Conservatives say current attempts to define and prevent \"misinformation\" are merely an excuse for companies that want to silence dissenting opinions. Zuckerberg also called for a major rollback of Section 230 immunity, which protects social media companies from liability for content published by their users. Zuckerberg's proposal would strip companies of Section 230 protections unless they enacted formal policies for the removal of unlawful content. Facebook already has such a policy and employs thousands of contractors to manually remove illegal or inappropriate content. The company also trumpeted its large Security and Safety teams in a new ad campaign that boasts \"Facebook is not waiting for regulation.\" Smaller social media platforms likely would not have the resources to enact similar policies. Facebook is the largest social media company in the world and is a major lobbyist on Capitol Hill. According to the Center For Responsive Politics , it spent almost $17 million on lobbying in 2019, making it one of the biggest lobbyists in Washington. Monika Bickert, Facebook's vice president of content policy, has suggested social media platforms should limit the reach of \"harmful\" content, rather than ban it completely. Companies including Facebook have been criticized for this \"shadowbanning,\" which is seen by many as another form of censorship. Despite calling for laws that would require social media companies to explain their content policies to users, Facebook does not notify users when content has been \"shadowbanned.\" Other tech companies have suggested different approaches to handling misinformation. In the March 25 hearing, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey suggested that social media users, not social media companies or the government should have the power to regulate content.

The changes to Seller Fulfilled Prime\u2014billed as improving Amazon customer experience\u2014have made acceptable performance metrics harder to achieve. As the Washington Free Beacon reported last February, Orthodox Jewish sellers are especially hard hit by six-day shipping requirements that make it more difficult to observe the Sabbath and maintain high one-day shipping numbers. Orthodox Jews make up a disproportionate number of the small sellers on the retail platform, with one estimate suggesting they are 15 percent of all small sellers. At the time, participants warned the changes would drive them off the platform. Months later, those fears are being validated. One informal poll in a private group of Seller Fulfilled Prime participants found only 5 percent of users understood how to meet the new metrics. Another poll found over half of a group of Orthodox Jewish participants had been suspended from the program in the past two months. The Seller Fulfilled Prime program allows small sellers to list their own items for Amazon Prime. But in February, Amazon required that sellers list items for two-day delivery on six days of the week. Orthodox Jews cannot work on Saturday, and many sellers report local carriers will not pick up packages on Sunday. One Orthodox Jewish seller who asked not to be named said his shipping costs had jumped since the rule change, and that he was eliminating expensive items from Prime in response. \"I don't understand what Amazon gains by shutting out millions of items from SFP,\" he said. Other sellers complained that Amazon had put the additional pressure to satisfy consumers on them, rather than lobbying UPS and other carriers to ship items on Sunday. Amazon describes the changes as needed to improve the Prime experience for customers by further standardizing when packages are received. One seller told the Free Beacon that the driving force behind the changes was consumer demand: \"They think if they order it Friday, they will get it on Wednesday.\" But the changes have also driven speculation, with some sellers alleging that Amazon is purposefully looking to squeeze them off the platform. Others fear that Amazon would prefer sellers to use programs that require items be shipped to an Amazon warehouse first so that the seller can't also list items on Amazon rivals like Walmart. Saul Cohen, who mainly sells large items like cribs for babies, said the rule change hasn't affected him as much as it has sellers of smaller objects, who will lose more money by rush shipping across the country. \"That's a very large group, obviously,\" he said. Orthodox Jews have asked Amazon to allow them to toggle the Prime designation off during the weekend, but Amazon has resisted and announced it will suspend accounts from the program that regularly turn off Prime. One small seller reported an Amazon SFP agent told him that Amazon \"would come after\" anyone avoiding turning on Prime on the weekends. An organization lobbying Amazon on behalf of sellers said the company is stonewalling and has not responded to multiple messages. Some Orthodox sellers are considering a religious workaround that would involve selling a portion of their business to a non-Jew who can work on Saturdays. But it would be a radical and probably illicit step, says Rabbi Yosef Kushner of the Bais HaVaad Halacha Center. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.

In a case over whether President Joe Biden can block Twitter users from his personal account, Thomas wrote that Section 230, a federal law that protects online platforms from liability for content moderation, may violate the First Amendment. Thomas's concurring opinion in Biden v. Knight First Amendment Institute suggested that major social media companies could be treated as both \"common carriers\" and as \"places of public accommodation,\" two designations that would restrict platforms' ability to bar certain speech. \"Even if digital platforms are not close enough to common carriers,\" Thomas said, \"legislatures might still be able to treat digital platforms like places of public accommodation.\" The case addresses whether a government official\u2014in this case, Biden\u2014can block third-party accounts from his personal account if it is at times also used to announce official actions and policies. It mirrors a case brought by the same institute against the Trump administration, in which the court ruled Trump had to unblock third-party accounts. Though Thomas's opinion does not affect the outcome of Knight , it comes as a welcome surprise for advocates of greater controls on social media platforms and their ability to restrict users. Multiple state legislatures have floated restrictions on major social media platforms. Those restrictions have largely been viewed as not feasible, since Section 230 protects the ability of private platforms to make decisions about what content they host. But Thomas cited an argument that, when states pass laws barring social media censorship, Section 230 itself may violate the First Amendment by preempting those state laws. \"Justice Thomas is right: Big Tech's massive power to deliver and control the information flow in America gives it 'common carrier' status,\" said Mike Davis, founder of the anti-230 Internet Accountability Project. Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter \"have a different responsibility than other companies\u2014the responsibility to avoid viewpoint discrimination and to protect the free-speech rights of its users.\" Legal scholar Eugene Volokh, whose explanation of this argument was cited by Thomas, said that the justice's reading would face an uphill battle but that it was not on its face implausible. \"If I had to bet money, I would guess the courts would say Section 230 simply protects platforms' right to exclude people from their property,\" Volokh told the Washington Free Beacon . He also noted that social media platforms have much more room to maneuver in how they choose to recommend or promote material, even if they are required to host certain material. But several cases cited by Thomas suggest states can designate private entities as common carriers and regulate them accordingly. Thomas ended by arguing that, \"as Twitter made clear, the right to cut off speech lies most powerfully in the hands of private digital platforms.\" The case is No. 20-197 Biden v.

Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) / Getty Images Santi Ruiz April 25, 2021 image/svg+xml Some books are dull because of their subject matter, and others are dull despite it. Senator Amy Klobuchar's new opus, Antitrust: Taking on Monopoly Power from the Gilded Age to the Digital Age , manages to be even duller than its already dull subject. Though the last few pages detail Klobuchar's goals as head of the Senate antitrust subcommittee and may therefore be useful for some readers, they're packaged in 500 pages of incoherent fluff. Of course, antitrust law is a warren of dull economic jargon, and even the flashiest author would be hard-pressed to jazz it up. Early on, the Minnesota Democrat announces her commitment to making it accessible to a lay audience: In Antitrust , this approach means we get a long discursion on her maternal grandparents. Antitrust jumps from family history to American history and various policy prescriptions, but the main philosophical thrust is an attempt to situate antitrust law firmly in the American tradition. Klobuchar leans heavily on anti-monopolist tendencies among the Founders and state constitutions, quoting Alexander Hamilton at length (with the requisite nods to the Broadway show). At times, the history seems disjointed, as when she argues that America's Founders could \"never have conceived of the enormous influence\" multinational companies now have in the same paragraph as she notes their attacks on the British East India Company. The book then moves into a dense, detail-laden account of every antitrust movement of the last two centuries, evidently to show Klobuchar has done the reading. Multiple pages are block quotes lifted out of various antitrust textbooks. She's conspicuously careful when criticizing political figures for their racial record. Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson all receive flak for their prejudice, while a page later Margaret Sanger, America's most successful eugenicist, is described solely as \"an advocate for women's access to contraceptives.\" As a senator from the Land of 10,000 Lakes, Klobuchar loves a good water reference: Checks \"are literally flooding the seat of democracy\" (they are not literally flooding the seat of democracy); \"we need to cross the river of our divides to reach higher ground\" (which side are we crossing to?). There are the rhetorical crutches: In \"the era of BIG,\" \"we need to invest in people.\" Antitrust law itself is explained more times than I could count. On page 345, the absentminded reader is reminded that antitrust law is \"about penalizing unlawful, anticompetitive conduct.\" Klobuchar rightfully points out the \"Swiss cheese\" of contemporary antitrust law, which is littered with carveouts for industries as disparate as baseball and anti-hog-cholera serum. Antitrust should be \"a serious, nonpartisan lever of competition policy\"\u2014she's particularly miffed that almost a third of Antitrust Division probes under former president Donald Trump targeted the weed industry. Klobuchar then pivots in the back half of the book to a laundry list of Democratic prescriptions, from ending right-to-work laws to net neutrality to a new voting rights act. The ties between these topics are unclear and at times completely contradictory. When the Sinclair Broadcast Group blames \"fake news\" for declining trust in the industry, it's dangerous. A page later, Klobuchar says we face a wave of \"blatantly and misleading\" news. As the chairwoman of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, Klobuchar has made no secret of her goal of passing sweeping antitrust legislation. And there seems to be increased appetite from both sides of the aisle for checks on big tech companies. Klobuchar notes that congressional hearings are all well and good, but no substitute for comprehensive legislation. She's hoping 50 other colleagues feel the same way. But for all its bluster, Antitrust rarely goes after existing monopolies. Klobuchar prefers instead to tie each prescription to a warning about how monopolies in the abstract are bad for consumers. Perhaps it's simply wise politicking, but it's a noticeable tonal shift after a fact-heavy historical overview. And there's little description of the anticompetitive behavior companies like Facebook and Amazon engage in daily. The book ends with \"10 things you can do\" to curb corporate power. Citizens are advised to \"make your voice heard by writing op-eds\" or to \"start a small business to take on the power of BIG yourself, and find a committed lawyer.\" It's a bizarre conclusion to a book on the policy levers the government has to rein in big business. One hopes the antitrust legislation Klobuchar lobbies for over the coming years is, if as dry as her book, at least more coherent.

The practice was originally reported in 2018 by TechCrunch, which described how Amazon gave \"fulfillment center ambassadors\" rewards such as paid days off and a $50 gift card. Amazon has spun up several new accounts for workers. The practice creates the appearance of grassroots support as working conditions at Amazon's warehouses and the company's decision to yank books from its shelves face increased public scrutiny. The accounts are run by Amazon warehouse workers, although some accounts have switched between different individuals. The accounts appear to have been created by Amazon, rather than by the workers: All tweets are sent through Sprinklr, a social media management tool Amazon uses for its official accounts. Although some accounts were suspended by Twitter for violation of its rules (likely including \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\"), new accounts have been created as recently as March 2021.

The company invested almost $20 million in lobbying Congress in 2020 and is taking a more aggressive line against its critics in Congress and in the media. With the ambassadors program, Amazon is attempting to respond directly to individual criticisms online. \"FC Ambassadors are employees who work in our fulfillment centers and choose to share their personal experience,\" an Amazon spokesman told the Washington Free Beacon . \"The FC ambassador program helps show what it\u2019s actually like inside our fulfillment centers, along with the public tours we provide.\" Researchers are divided over whether Amazon\u2019s behavior constitutes \"astroturfing.\" In the paper \" Online Astroturfing: A Theoretical Perspective ,\" researchers defined the practice as \"when people are hired to present certain beliefs or opinions on behalf of their employer through various communication channels.\" Kenneth Henrie, a professor at Penn State who studies messaging on social media, argued that astroturfing is typically used to refer to completely fake accounts. \"Maybe it's a bit like astroturfing with a twist of Stockholm syndrome,\" he told the Washington Free Beacon . The company is engaged in a high-profile public relations battle over the vote to unionize at its Bessemer, Ala., warehouse. The company clashed with Senators Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) over whether it should pay higher taxes and compensate workers more generously. Amazon also pushed back on claims from Rep. Mark Pocan (D., Wis.) that its workers are forced to urinate in water bottles, though internal emails show that Amazon is aware of some delivery workers peeing in bottles to save time. The accounts typically respond to critics of Amazon\u2019s working conditions by describing their satisfaction with their jobs. @AmazonFCTea, for example, writes , \"I'm only one Amazon worker. But I've never needed any form of income assistance while working here. The pay has been good for me and my family. The workload itself has never been unreasonable for me.\" Another account usually rebuts claims that Amazon workers are restricted from using the bathroom while on the clock. @AmazonFCIsaac responded to accusations that he was paid by Amazon to tweet with \"Nope I'm not paid extra to say this. I'm a packer in the pack singles department and two days out of the week I get the opportunity to share online my experiences and how it really is to work in an Amazon warehouse. And I use the bathroom just like everybody else.\" Nope I'm not paid extra to say this.

The Vox site Recode reported Sunday that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos expressed frustration that the company wasn't pushing back hard enough against its critics. The vote on whether to unionize ends on Monday. If union organizers are successful, the Bessemer warehouse will be the first Amazon warehouse to unionize.

It is the one resource that cannot be exhausted; that cannot be used up.\" The claim was astonishingly bold\u2014that nothing farmers did could affect the underlying health of their land. A growing wave of young conservatives, however, are pushing back on this way of thinking. Drawing on disparate influences like Wendell Berry, James C. Scott, Patrick Deneen, and Wallace Stegner, they argue that both big government and big corporations have squeezed small farms almost into oblivion, stripping American land of nutrients and health in the hunt for profit. By subsidizing monocrops such as corn and soy, we have weakened rural food security and economic resilience. Grace Olmstead is one such thinker. Her new book, Uprooted: Recovering the Legacy of the Places We\u2019ve Left Behind , functions both as an investigation into the policy tools that have crushed small farms and a memoir about the effect these policies had on rural communities, many of which are aging rapidly. The young in these communities see little opportunity to build a full life for themselves in places where their parents and grandparents now struggle to break even. Olmstead speaks from personal experience: Her grandparents farmed a small plot in rural Idaho, but she has since moved to Virginia. She wrestles openly with the tension of moving away from home while calling for more commitment to the places we\u2019ve been given. Uprooted argues that there are values other than efficiency and low consumer prices worth defending \u2014 among them the vibrancy and self-sufficiency of rural communities, and their consistent care for the land. \"Care\" is a touchstone for Olmstead. \"Our world is preserved through the work of maintenance and caregiving,\" she says. \"The work of those who tend the very young and very old, who steward soil, plants, and animals, or who maintain the integrity of our infrastructure. They are the ones who fight back entropy and death, who preserve and protect life and health. They are most often devalued and underpaid.\" And yet \"the work they do is indispensable to the ongoing health of our society and ecology. Without maintainers and caregivers, everything starts to fall apart.\" When I interviewed her a few weeks ago, Olmstead noted how hard it is to defend the value of nurturing land to big agribusinesses, which see farming as a fundamentally extractive business. Those big farms receive massive support from the federal government for producing crops like corn and soybeans that can be marketed internationally. These businesses tend not to nurture the soil they grow on. \"The ideal farm of the modern era,\" says Olmstead, \"was seen as a machine or even a factory: an endeavor of cold efficiency and productivity, not a work of complexity or of culture.\" Uprooted \u2019s focus on soil health is especially timely now, as advances in sensing technology have exposed the degraded state of much American land. A new study from UMass Amherst found that erosion from modern methods of crop tilling and harvesting may be removing as much as 30 percent of topsoil from the Midwest \"Corn Belt.\" Researchers leveraged remote sensing technology, using high-resolution satellite imagery to determine where topsoil has been completely stripped from land. The Department of Agriculture, on the other hand, uses less technologically advanced methods to assess land erosion\u2014it takes soil samples from various locations and qualitatively assesses the severity of erosion in a given field. As a result, it is less gloomy about the effect of monocropping on land. But if the UMass Amherst researchers are correct, farms big and small across the American West could face a coming catastrophe, as the land is slowly stripped of its value. Meanwhile, city governments claiming to be environmentally friendly are turning away from composting and other soil regeneration efforts. New York City, which in 2015 committed to sending zero waste to landfills by 2030, has shut down its curbside composting program. A recent Civil Eats piece revealed the city is also forcing out two major privately run composting initiatives from their plots of land in East River Park and Queens. In the leadup to the Dust Bowl disaster, the Department of Agriculture told farmers that settling and tilling the West could actually change the climate, making it more hospitable to farming: \"The rain will follow the plow.\" This belief was profoundly misguided. Olmstead cites a 1934 soil erosion study that found roughly half the state of Idaho had serious erosion problems. In the wake of disaster, New Deal programs funneled support to larger farmers, on the assumption that small farms were not sophisticated and efficient eno"

As previously reported by the Washington Free Beacon , the company had banned discussion of administrator Aimee Challenor by name and blocked news articles that discussed Challenor\u2019s ties to pedophiles. The announcement came after a successful protest by large portions of Reddit\u2019s userbase: Hundreds of subreddits, or forums, went private to protest the censorship. But the company\u2019s decision to censor discussion was a troubling step for a platform that had previously built a reputation for being largely hands off on content moderation, relying on volunteer moderators to police forums. Social media platforms have faced increasing criticism for aggressive content moderation, but Reddit\u2019s decentralized structure has protected it from much of the frustration. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman posted on a major Reddit board, \"As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN [Reddit\u2019s video streaming network]. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her.\" \"We\u2019ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both,\" Huffman said. \"In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions.\" Doxxing is typically used to refer to the publication of private details about an individual, such as a home address. Reddit users expressed frustration in the comments of Huffman\u2019s post that Reddit was using the term to describe the discussion of widely publicized news stories. Reddit hired Challenor earlier this year. Users pointed out Challenor appointed her father as her campaign manager for a British election in 2017\u2014after he had been charged with raping a 10-year-old girl. Challenor was suspended by the British Green Party when the news came to light, and later was expelled by the Liberal Democrats after her fianc\u00e9 tweeted about his sexual interest in children.

Dozens of Reddit pages have gone private in protest over the social media company's decision to censor criticism of an employee who hired her father, a child rapist, to run a political campaign Major forums like r/music , r/fitness , and r/coronavirus , which each have millions of users, have closed, along with hundreds of smaller forums. They are protesting a Reddit decision to ban users who mention Aimee Challenor, a former British Green Party politician now working as an administrator for Reddit. Challenor appointed her father as campaign manager during her unsuccessful run for Parliament in 2017, even though he had been charged with raping a 10-year-old girl. Her father has since been convicted and is serving a 22-year sentence. The user-driven revolt against aggressive content moderation marks a new front in an already raging online battle over how much moderation social media platforms should conduct. But Reddit, unlike Facebook and Twitter, has traditionally avoided moderating all but the most egregious content. Forums on Reddit, which bills itself as \"the front page of the Internet,\" are run by moderators, who come from the forum's community and are volunteers. Reddit has generally been loath to moderate content on forums itself, relying on a forum's moderators to set the tone and establish rules. Challenor moderated the major Reddit forum r/lgbt among others for several years. She had influence over Reddit's approach to content moderation even before officially joining the company. In April 2020, Challenor wrote a public letter to Reddit that was cosigned by moderators from other boards, asking the company to crack down on trolls. Reddit responded that same day. Among the forums banned was a forum for trans people who had since detransitioned. Challenor is herself transgender. In March 2021, Challenor announced on a private messaging channel she ran that she was joining Reddit as an administrator. Shortly afterward, Reddit users who posted a link to a Spectator story that mentioned Challenor's Green Party involvement were blocked, and the popular forum r/UKpolitics was shuttered, although Reddit later restored the forum. In response to the Spectator , Reddit suggested that the blocks were automated: \"Earlier this month, a Reddit employee was the target of harassment and doxxing (sharing of personal or confidential information). Reddit activated standard processes to protect the employee from such harassment, including initiating an automated moderation rule to prevent personal information from being shared.\" Many of the now-private Reddit forums have posted statements decrying Reddit's behavior. Moderators of the forum r/music said, \"Music is joining many subreddits in condemning child abuse and censorship. Reddit has hired a known enabler & protector of a convicted child rapist & torturer. Mentions of their name are being removed, and the posters banned. We are private in protest of Reddit's conduct; we demand actionable statements from the admins.\" R/music and other forums participating in the protest link to a document explaining the rationale and listing the forums involved. At the time of writing, the protesting forums appear to have over 60 million combined subscribers. Other Reddit users have argued that Challenor should not be employed by Reddit at all, noting her close ties to individuals with disturbing backgrounds. Challenor's husband Nathaniel Knight, who is also trans, has written at length about his sexual fantasies involving children. The Reddit scandal echoes recent cases in which social media platforms exercised wide latitude to ban users for criticizing trans activists. In 2018, Twitter and blogging platform WordPress removed critical posts referring to Canadian trans activist Jessica Yaniv. Blogging platform WordPress stealth-edited posts from users referring to Yaniv's old name. Reddit did not return a request for comment. Published under: Censorship , Social Media , Transgenderism"

Though not a household name, Brand is one of the key instigators of multiple utopian movements, from America\u2019s environmental awakening in the 1970s to the DIY movement to early hacker culture. The film is a piece of propaganda, but a self-aware one, and at times marvelously enjoyable. Brand doesn't fit comfortably into existing buckets, political or cultural. As a young photographer, he is swept into the world of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters and even orchestrates the Trips Festival, an LSD-fueled bash that by some accounts kicked off the hippie movement in San Francisco. Shortly afterward, Brand trips and is struck by the realization that we haven't seen a photograph of the whole earth, despite winning the space race. How different would things be? he asks. It's a strangely successful rallying cry for the burgeoning environmental movement. Then he puts together the Whole Earth Catalog , a massive magazine/encyclopedia focused on ecology and DIY techniques (the slogan is \"access to tools\"). Steve Jobs calls it \"Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along.\" Later, Brand leads early efforts to popularize the internet, refurbishes a tug boat, and oversees the building of a \"thousand year clock.\" The movie leaves out several more projects: his attempt to catalog all species of life on earth with his All Species Foundation, his time as an adviser to California governor Jerry Brown, and his campaigns for nuclear power. He's everywhere. You may not buy the claims that he kickstarted the environmental movement, or that startup culture was born directly out of the Whole Earth Catalog , but plenty of his contemporaries sure do. Brand is an iconoclast, but also inescapably a product of his time: The sequence where he explains how a years-long, drug-fueled depression destroyed his first marriage would be apt material for Helen Andrews's Boomers . At its best, We Are As Gods portrays Brand's infectious enthusiasm for a particular brand of futurist techno-optimism. Though he studied under Paul Ehrlich, a \"notorious doomsayer\" (that's from Ehrlich in the film), Brand thinks humans can be a net positive in the ecological web. He's not a stereotypical movement leader: He's lanky, quiet, understated, even silly. But his vision attracts followers wherever he goes and creates a series of ideological clashes with more doctrinaire environmentalists. Brand\u2019s entrepreneurial attitude repeatedly puts him at odds with compatriots who are generally more skeptical of human-driven projects. Like Brand's former mentor Ehrlich, they can't quite trust anthropocentric solutions to climate change and degradation. More than once, we see Brand sitting, quietly, as an activist levies war against Brandian hubris. We Are As Gods does a good job of presenting Brand\u2019s vision without undercutting the more traditional environmental arguments. It\u2019s clear Brand is an iconoclast even within the movements he helped start. What gets Brand going today\u2014and for the past two decades\u2014is one of those anthropocentric solutions: what he describes as biological geoengineering. Brand wants to use all the tools of genetic engineering at human disposal to restore creatures, like the American chestnut tree and the woolly mammoth, that filled important niches in their old ecosystems. The chestnut project is eminently feasible through existing grafting techniques; the mammoth more quixotic. We Are As Gods premiered at the South By Southwest film festival this past week. It is the first movie out from Stripe Press, the content arm of a rapidly growing Silicon Valley finance company. The film is a clear continuation of Stripe\u2019s attempts to build a coherent West Coast techno-optimistic aesthetic. The company has previously produced a set of beautifully bound books that address how technology and popular culture fit together, including Martin Gurri\u2019s The Revolt of the Public and Richard Hamming\u2019s The Art of Doing Science and Engineering . Stripe is also taking a Brandian approach toward environmental challenges, offering a new platform for technologies that capture carbon and remove it from the atmosphere. It\u2019s a goal seemingly as utopian as Brand\u2019s deextinction projects. That said, the film remains an inspiring look at a character who has spent his life trying to convince us that, given the right tools and a hefty dose of optimism, we might just make it out all right.

The news was first reported by The Verge . As a senator, Nelson lobbied for the Space Launch System (SLS), an in-house launch vehicle for NASA that has been dogged by cost overruns and engineering failures. The SLS is now multiple years behind schedule, while a new generation of space companies claims they will soon be able to deliver larger payloads for far less. Nelson's nomination signals that the agency may spend less time on such commercial development. As reported by the Washington Free Beacon , researchers and some space startups fear Nelson would slow NASA's transition to the modern space era, arguing his support for SLS is the product of a 20th century mentality. They point to the burgeoning supply chain of reusable rockets as examples of innovation the private sector can provide in partnership with NASA, and argue his defense of SLS was largely motivated by protecting the manufacturing jobs it provided in his home state of Florida. Defenders of Nelson say the SLS is currently the best vehicle to take Americans to the Moon and beyond, and that the Moon landing occurred through government-designed technology rather than public-private partnerships. In 2017, Nelson led the Senate charge against Jim Bridenstine, Donald Trump's nominee for the position. At the time, Nelson told Politico , \"The head of NASA ought to be a space professional, not a politician.\" Bridenstine received bipartisan acclaim for his management of the agency, with several sources calling him the best administrator since the 1960s. A career politician himself, Nelson has campaigned for Biden in the past, and Biden stumped for Nelson during his unsuccessful 2018 Senate run. In private, Nelson has been at times harshly critical of commercial space companies. In 2011, after Elon Musk announced the development of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket, Nelson reportedly told NASA officials to \"keep your boy in line.\" SpaceX's super-heavy lift launch vehicles directly compete with the SLS, which Nelson lobbied aggressively for in 2011. SLS advocates say the United States should retain ownership of the intellectual property needed to get to the moon and Mars, and point to the manufacturing jobs it creates. Jim Maser, an executive at Aerojet Rocketdyne, which manufactures parts for the SLS, told the Washington Free Beacon that government and the private sector can both play a role in space. \"For example, U.S. commercial companies provide access to low-Earth orbit while NASA leads the way in deep space exploration.\" On Monday, however, Ars Technica reported the Biden administration is conducting an internal review of the SLS\u2019s affordability. The rocket is expected to cost upwards of $2 billion for each launch and has already cost over $20 billion to build. Will Rinehart, a researcher at the Center for Growth and Opportunity, said, \"If Nelson is confirmed to lead NASA, it's all but waving the white flag on space.\" Rinehart pointed out that Nelson has been a key backer of NASA's traditional procurement methods, which have been largely responsible for the agency's exorbitant costs per rocket relative to commercial companies. Late last month, NASA quietly upped the prices it charges commercial users of the International Space Station, angering customers who had not been informed. The move suggests NASA sees a spike in demand by the industry, which is developing reusable rockets that would open access to space significantly. But the Biden administration's emphasis in public messaging has been on continuing scientific research, not on public-private partnerships. The 2020 Democratic Party platform emphasized strengthening observation missions to assess climate change from space. \"Managing the Earth's ability to sustain human life and biodiversity will likely, in my view, dominate a civil space agenda for a Biden-Harris administration,\" said Lori Garver, the Obama administration's deputy NASA administrator. The administration does plan to continue the Trump push to land a human mission on the Moon, although it is not expected to push for the original 2024 deadline. Former Republican congressman and current space lobbyist Robert Walker said he hoped for continuity in NASA's goals, stressing the necessity of keeping the Commercial Crew and Cargo Program, a successful public-private partnership run by NASA. He expressed qualified support, saying, \"Bill Nelson may be the right guy to keep NASA stabilized during an administration that's not particularly focused on space.\" For younger space advocates, maintaining those programs i"

Greg Abbott (R.) (Getty Images Santi Ruiz March 5, 2021 image/svg+xml In a press conference on Friday, Texas governor Greg Abbott (R.) announced S.B. 12 , a bill that would prohibit social media companies from \"censoring Texans.\" \"Conservative speech will not be canceled in the state of Texas,\" said the governor. The bill's language is similar to that of legislation proposed by Republicans in several states, including Arizona, Minnesota, and Florida, where it was backed by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R.). The bills have also been backed by the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a conservative advocacy group. S.B. 12 would \"prohibit social media companies from censoring Texans based upon Texans' viewpoints,\" Abbott explained. Since Twitter and Facebook banned then-President Donald Trump from their platforms after the January 6 riots, the issue of social media censorship has caught fire among the conservative base. As reported by the Washington Free Beacon , the bills all face similar constitutional concerns. Under the Constitution, private companies can determine what speech they wish to host on their platforms. The bills may also be unconstitutional under the commerce clause, which bars states from unduly regulating interstate commerce. Additionally, the state bills appear to violate Section 230, the federal law that codifies First Amendment protections for internet companies and expressly preempts contradictory state law. In the press conference, Republican state senator and bill sponsor Bryan Hughes said, \"No one is talking about lewd, lascivious, or obscene speech.\" The bill's text, however, would ban all moderation of content not explicitly illegal under current law, meaning that companies would be legally required to host obscenity.

The e-commerce giant explained its policy , which had previously not been public, in response to a request for clarification from senators concerned about the banning of When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment by Ryan T. Anderson. Amazon pulled the book from its shelves on February 21. \"We have chosen not to sell books that frame LGBTQ+ identity as a mental illness,\" said Amazon. Author Ryan T. Anderson pushed back on Twitter, saying the ban is based on misinterpretations of his book. First reported by the Wall Street Journal on Friday, the news comes as further confirmation of the ideological guidelines Amazon uses to determine which books it will allow. Amazon is the largest bookseller in the country, with over half of all book sales coming from the platform. Republican senators Marco Rubio (Fla.), Mike Lee (Utah), Mike Braun (Ind.), and Josh Hawley (Mo.) asked Amazon to clarify why the book had been removed from the platform and whether the ban marked the beginning of a new approach from the tech giant. In its response, Amazon seemed to confirm that only the distributer had been informed of the ban, not the publisher or author: \"Amazon notified the distributor via email of the removal of the book for violating our content guidelines on the day the book was removed from sale.\" Anderson and his publisher Encounter Books both said they found out about the ban when they were contacted by prospective buyers who could not find the book on the platform. Amazon avoided responding to requests from the senators for documentation of the change in policy and whether publishers and sellers were notified of the change. Amazon's refusal to answer certain questions may cause further political trouble for the company. In an op-ed Friday, Rubio announced his support for striking Amazon workers in Alabama, citing Amazon's new books policy. In February, Lee stated his willingness to work with Democratic senators to rein in big tech companies that are creating \"a corporatist nightmare of censorship and hypocrisy.\" The American Psychiatric Association referred to gender dysphoria as a disorder in its influential Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders until 2012, when it changed its description to \"a marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender.\" Gender dysphoria is still considered a disorder in cases in which the individual experiences \"significant distress or impairment in major areas of life.\" \"Everyone agrees that gender dysphoria is a serious condition that causes great suffering,\" said Anderson and Encounter Books on Thursday. \"There is a debate, however, which Amazon is seeking to shut down, about how best to treat patients who experience gender dysphoria.\" Published under: Amazon , Cancel Culture , Transgenderism Amazon Now Bans Books That Treat Gender Dysphoria as Mental Illness MacKenzie Scott Sends Millions to Terror-Tied Nonprofit Network Bring in More Prosecutors: Finally Ending Minnesota\u2019s \u2018Never-Ending\u2019 Somali Fraud Schemes Requires Reinforcements Take My Governor\u2014Please Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Prepared To Flee to Moscow if Regime Loses Control Walz Drops Reelection Bid as Minnesota Reels From Massive Welfare Fraud Amazon Now Bans Books That Treat Gender Dysphoria as Mental Illness Politics Trump Resolves the Maduro Problem The Foreign Policy Winners and Losers of 2025 As Europe Steps Back, Asia Steps Up Newsletters Morning Beacon"

The calls for a renewed focus on cybersecurity come as the federal government reels from the \"SolarWinds\" hack, in which foreign intruders gained access to vast swathes of federal agency communications and records over the course of 2020. Intelligence agencies are still working to identify the scope of the damage but believe Russian intelligence likely accessed emails from the Treasury Department, the State Department, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and even DHS itself. In its aftermath, researchers and lawmakers worry that foreign adversaries have the upper hand on the federal government, and that programs including DHS\u2019s EINSTEIN, the first line of defense, are unfit for modern cyberwarfare. Initially developed in 2003, EINSTEIN is an intrusion detection system that monitors the internet traffic of executive branch agencies to spot bad actors. EINSTEIN is operated by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is housed within Homeland Security. CISA describes EINSTEIN as an \"early warning system\" that offers \"near real-time identification of malicious cyber activity, and prevention of that malicious cyber activity.\" In a statement given to the Washington Free Beacon , Rep. John Katko (R., N.Y.), ranking member on the House Homeland Security Committee, said, \"It\u2019s no longer just as simple as telling people to \u2018patch their stuff,\u2019\" and called for a further centralization of cybersecurity work within CISA. Katko has previously endorsed tapping funds for anti-terrorism infrastructure defenses already available to cities and states for cybersecurity purposes. EINSTEIN has long been criticized for its passive posture. Critics argue that the detection system is fundamentally hamstrung by its design, which allows it to match intrusions against an existing database of known malware and sketchy IP addresses. A 2015 staff report for the late senator Tom Coburn (R., Okla.) warned that EINSTEIN \"can only detect known fingerprints\u2014malware that changes its signatures can be effectively impossible to detect by signature-based intrusion detection.\" Additionally, the Government Accountability Office has repeatedly lambasted both Homeland Security and participating agencies for a lack of preparedness. Though EINSTEIN has been mandatory for executive branch agencies since 2015, the GAO found almost all agencies involved were not taking adequate steps to secure their systems and communicate information to DHS. \"It's fair to say that EINSTEIN wasn't designed properly,\" said former Trump cybersecurity official Thomas Bossert after the SolarWinds hack. Difficulty attracting top talent, insufficient funding, and overstretched personnel contribute to a beleaguered environment at DHS. Mark Montgomery, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that without matching DHS and other cyber watchers with the proper resources, the United States remains extremely vulnerable to disaster. \"You\u2019re under-resourced, unhappy, and undertrained. That is not the cybersecurity workforce you want to develop,\" Montgomery said. \"We have not done a good job the last 20-plus years defending our critical infrastructure.\" Montgomery also serves as an adviser to the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, a Trump administration project designed to take a hard look at the country\u2019s current strength on the digital battlefield. The commission\u2019s extensive report suggested the threat from hackers extends well into the private sphere and across government and that cybersecurity is not just a problem for the Pentagon. Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R., N.Y.), the ranking member on the House subcommittee for cybersecurity, emphasized that the need for strong cybersecurity now cuts across nearly all sectors of American life and therefore requires a whole-of-government approach. \"In today's hyper-connected world, cybersecurity is national security,\" Garbarino said. \"Cyber threats are now more prolific than at any time in our history, as is the indiscriminate targeting of the federal government, private sector, state and locals, and private citizens.\" Foreign adversaries are increasingly targeting major American corporations. On March 2, Microsoft announced that its email service Microsoft Exchange had been compromised, and that Chinese actors were likely behind the hack. The CEO of cybersecurity firm Volexity, which discovered the attack, said it began in January but that the attacks ramped up in late February. DHS urged federal agencies affected to patch their systems and send a full report to CISA. The Biden administration thus far has talked about the need to put cybersecurity at the tip of the spear for America\u2019s national defense, but little to no action has been taken on this front. Montgomery said that due to the complex threat environment cyber officials face, it often takes time for new leadership to get up to speed on how to approach their positions. Such a learning curve makes it all the more important for early and speedy nomination processes for Senate-confirmable cyber positions, such as the director of CISA. The administration has not yet put a nomination to lead CISA on the floor, nor have they evinced any timeline for doing so. The Biden administration did not return a request for comment on its timeline to nominate a CISA director or other key cybersecurity appointments.

And labs continue to make scientific breakthroughs, from assembling almost the entire mammoth genome to growing hair and fat out of petri dishes. Although the project of bringing back megafauna to roam vast tracts of Siberian tundra sounds grandiose, deextinction work is actually proceeding on shoestring budgets. Many researchers commit unpaid time. The Woolly Mammoth Revival Team consists of five folks at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard, led by George Church, a titan (physically and mentally) of genomics. A grab bag of American, European, Japanese, and Korean scholars collaborates on trips to northern Siberia to retrieve mammoth carcasses. But the closest thing deextinction has to a powerful backer is Stewart Brand, whose Long Now Foundation has supported the Church Lab through its Revive & Restore organization. Eriona Hysolli, a research fellow in the lab, says that a few anonymous donors help support deextinction work but that the cost of lab equipment and reagents scares most off. As for methods of deextinction, several have been bandied about. Quite a few animals, including sheep, pigs, cattle, mice, and dogs, have been cloned. But it would be exponentially more difficult to clone an extinct creature. The two \"successful\" cases cited in the literature have been a type of Pyrenean ibex, known as a bucardo, in 2009 and the aptly named Lazarus frog in 2013. Both had gone extinct fairly recently: The bucardo was cloned from tissue of the last living bucardo, captured in 1999, while 40-year-old frozen frog tissue was used for the Lazarus. Alas, the ibex suffered a major lung deformity and died within minutes, and no frog embryos survived beyond a few days. Cloning animals is hard, Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park notwithstanding. The technique used in those cases is the same as in the cloning of Dolly the sheep\u2014somatic cell nuclear transfer. One takes the nucleus of the creature to be cloned and plants it in a different, \"denucleated\" egg cell, then zaps it with electricity to begin the embryonic process. Akira Iritani, researcher at the Kyoto University in Japan and cofounder of the Mammoth Creation Project, planned to perform this procedure with the nucleus of a woolly mammoth cell and the egg of a female elephant, but mammoth cells in good condition were needed. Lo and behold, a well-preserved mammoth was found in 2010. Yuka spent two years stored in the permafrost until scientists from the Mammoth Museum in Yakutsk could venture out to assess her. She is now on display in Moscow, and a small sample of her skin was used by Iritani's team. The team managed to pull nucleus-like structures from the deep-frozen remains, planted them into mouse cells, and watched as some activity occurred. But cell division didn't occur: You couldn't grow a full, living creature from these ancient nuclei. Hysolli explains that all cells undergo radiation damage over time, meaning it would take a miracle to find a mammoth cell whole enough to survive the traditional cloning process. Considering Iritani is now 91, it will be up to the next generation of deextinction researchers to find a path forward. Scientists are left with a plan that's not cloning, exactly: Rather, they're working on \"elephants with mammoth characteristics,\" or what Hysolli likes to call an \"elemoth.\" It's on this front that the successful advances have come. Mammoths and elephants share more than 99 percent of their DNA, which means researchers can play around with the two to try and develop mammoth traits in an otherwise all-elephant genome. Theoretically, one can splice Asian elephant DNA with lab-engineered DNA that mimics certain features of a mammoth. Church's lab has already succeeded in engineering cells for thicker fat reserves and hair growth: The sight of petri dishes overflowing with mammoth hair is perhaps the most disturbing feature of the project. Church says his current focus is on genes for smaller external ear size, cold-tolerant hemoglobin genes, shorter tusks, and resistance to elephant herpes (evidently a scourge among captive elephants). The difficulty is that the impressive efforts to sequence the mammoth genome only cover the sections that overlap with an elephant genome: They use the elephant's as a structure on which to hang the broken snippets of ancient mammoth DNA in the correct order. There is no way to piece together mammoth DNA that doesn't match an elephant\u2019s. \"To get these parts, w"

First reported by Breaking Defense , the rumor would infuriate many in the industry if true. Simon Porter, an astrophysicist on the New Horizons mission to Pluto, said on Twitter, \"That would be incredibly dumb \u2026 Nelson represents everything NASA needs to get away from.\" Nelson is \"pushing hard\" to become NASA administrator by leveraging his personal relationship with Biden, according to Ars Technica . But critics are pushing back, describing the 78-year-old ex-senator as a relic of the old guard whose track record supporting major in-house projects spells danger for the burgeoning commercial space industry. Eli Dourado, a researcher at the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University, said he worries Nelson would take NASA in the wrong direction. \"The agency has been at its best when it has worked to create new commercial capabilities that it can then leverage in its science mission. Nelson has made a career of opposing this approach, instead favoring big-dollar programs that create jobs in Florida.\" One space insider who asked to remain nameless said, \"Nelson would be a disaster.\" But Nelson does have a long history with NASA. As a congressman in 1986, he secured a nonprofessional spot on a space shuttle mission, spending six days in orbit. Nelson justified his ride-along in his 1988 memoir Mission: An American Congressman\u2019s Voyage to Space , saying, \"If I was going to speak about the space program accurately in Congress, I wanted to feel what the astronauts felt.\" Nelson is also closely linked to the Space Launch System (SLS), an expendable launch vehicle widely seen as a major NASA failure. The program was established in 2011 after congressional leaders including Nelson demanded a NASA program to build its own large rocket in exchange for an Obama administration push to open contracts to private companies, the Commercial Crew Program. As part of the deal, Congress required the SLS rocket to be largely built out of old Space Shuttle parts, which protected manufacturing jobs in Nelson\u2019s home state. More than a decade and $20 billion later, the SLS has yet to launch. A NASA inspector general report in 2019 found rampant cost overruns, performance issues, and \"challenges with program management.\" A December 2020 report from the GAO found NASA\u2019s planned flight Artemis I, which would use the SLS system, was three years behind the schedule set by NASA in 2014 to measure performance. The Artemis program will purportedly land the first woman and the next man on the Moon by 2024. SLS has been panned in the space industry as a boondoggle. \"We don't need a rocket made of re-tread space shuttle parts,\" said one space insider who asked not to be identified. Its close competitor, SpaceX\u2019s Starship, is on track to deliver larger payloads to space at much lower costs. On Monday, space company Rocket Lab announced its new large reusable rocket. \"Other than small launch vehicles, there's no reason to be developing a fully expendable rocket after the year 2022. They're obsolete,\" said Joel Sercel, founder of space company Trans Astronautica. Nelson would also be presiding over an agency whose greatest successes came when its average employee age was substantially lower than it is today. In 2018, a GAO report found that over half of NASA\u2019s workforce was over 50 years old. By contrast, the average age of the mission control room that landed Apollo 11 was 28. Multiple space insiders suggested Nelson himself is out of touch with the new generation driving space innovation. Lori Garver, the former deputy administrator under Obama, said , \"now is not the time to turn back the clock at NASA.\" In 2017, Nelson opposed President Trump\u2019s pick for NASA administrator, former representative Jim Bridenstine, saying, \"The head of NASA ought to be a space professional, not a politician.\" Bridenstine, who stepped down in January, is now viewed as one of the best NASA administrators in decades. Nelson\u2019s nomination would cut against previous speculation that the Biden administration was looking to nominate a woman to the role. Eric Stallmer of Voyager Space Holdings told Politico \"there are some fantastic women candidates out there that I think should be highly considered.\" Two of those candidates, Ellen Stofan and Pam Melroy, served on Biden\u2019s eight-person NASA transition team.

Author Ryan T. Anderson tweeted on Monday that Amazon had removed his book When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment from its platforms. Amazon refused to give an explanation to Anderson or his publisher and has not responded to requests from the Washington Free Beacon or from four senators concerned about its use of monopoly power. The Post covered Anderson's book extensively when it came out in 2018. The piece , headlined \"Ryan Anderson's book on transgender people is creating an uproar,\" originally contained several misstatements of Anderson's positions. The original version said , \"Anderson makes an inflammatory claim\u2014that transgender people are mentally ill.\" It also claimed Anderson had championed \"conversion therapy.\" When critics pointed out the falsehoods, the Post amended the piece to say, \"Anderson makes what some feel is an inflammatory case against transgender people.\" Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, bought the Washington Post in 2013. Post editors say they have never experienced editorial pressure from Bezos on stories. Shani George, director of communications for the Post , told the Free Beacon , \"We do not discuss our internal coverage plans, and all editorial decisions are made independent of the interests of any outside party or company.\" Marty Baron, the current executive editor, stressed in a New Yorker interview that Bezos \"actually believes in the mission of journalism; that he thinks it's really important for a democracy.\" Baron also said the Post had \"significantly expanded its coverage of technology.\" Baron will leave the paper at the end of February. When asked by the New Yorker if the Post covered Amazon differently than other companies, Baron strenuously denied it: \"In fact, sometimes I wonder whether we feel that we have to be even more aggressive just to prove that we're not being controlled in some way by our boss.\" Updated 5:01 p.m. to include comment from Shani George of the Washington Post .

The company's content guidelines previously contained no mention of hate speech . In an apparent contradiction, Amazon's \" Seller Central \" page on \"offensive and controversial materials\" currently exempts books from bans on other products that \"promote hatred.\" The policy could seemingly be invoked to bar sales of a wide variety of books previously deemed permissible on the platform. Amazon sells between 50 and 80 percent of all physical books in the United States. Amazon removed Ryan T. Anderson's When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment sometime before Monday, Feb. 22. Amazon's removal of the book means that, in addition to not providing the ebook or audiobook, other booksellers on the platform are also banned from selling it. Amazon says it moderates book content using \"a combination of machine learning, automation, and dedicated teams of human reviewers. We'll remove content that does not adhere to these guidelines and promptly investigate any book when notified of potential noncompliance. If we remove a title, we let the author, publisher, or selling partner know and they can appeal our decision.\" Anderson said he repeatedly defends the human dignity of people who think they are transgender in the book and pointed to passages such as, \"First and foremost, as we advocate for the truth, we must be careful not to stigmatize those who are suffering.\" Both the author and the publisher Encounter Books claimed they had not been contacted by Amazon, and that repeated requests for an explanation had gone unanswered. Anderson said he only found out the book had been removed when a prospective buyer alerted him. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) said the ban constituted \"digital book burning\" and that Amazon had also not responded to a request for more information from his office. Reached for comment by the Washington Free Beacon , Amazon directed this reporter to the new book policy . Online activist Zack Ford, whose campaign against Anderson's book in 2018 led to the Washington Post publishing and then stealth-editing critiques of the book, claimed victory following news of the book\u2019s ban. \"It's almost like there's no way you can dress up bigotry to be acceptable!\" he tweeted .

Amazon\u2019s policies stated all book removals would be communicated to the author and publisher, but both Anderson and his publisher Encounter Books have stated Amazon has yet to contact them and refuses to respond to questions for clarification.

The Minnesota Senate bill was introduced this week and is similar to the Arizona Senate bill. Both would impose fines of up to $75,000 on tech companies that ban users or remove their content for certain reasons\u2014a move welcomed by conservative voters concerned about censorship on major platforms. Similar legislation in Mississippi died in committee in early February. But state legislators are having trouble writing legislation that satisfies both grassroots pressure and constitutional requirements. Multiple experts say that the bills as written fly in the face of protections for the speech of private companies. Additionally, the experts say the bills likely run afoul of constitutional clauses that stop states from going against federal law. The state bills come as interest in battling social media platforms surges on the right. On January 6, Twitter banned then-President Donald Trump, and Facebook followed suit on January 7. On January 9, Amazon Web Services suspended the account of conservative platform Parler. State regulation attempts on social media gained national attention when Republican Florida governor and likely 2024 candidate Ron DeSantis announced he would support such legislation. GOP senators have also taken an increasingly adversarial stance toward big tech. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) has pushed for a complete ban on all mergers by big tech companies. On Tuesday, Mike Lee (R., Utah), historically a staunch supporter of free markets, called for increased antitrust scrutiny of Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon. The bills largely follow the same template. They all explicitly target large social media platforms and forbid platforms from removing speech that is not obscene and does not directly threaten violence. The Mississippi and Arizona bills both include a section that would bar social media websites from pointing to \"alleged hate speech\" by users on their platform as a legal justification for banning those users. Social media platforms currently have freedom to choose how they moderate content on their sites. The bills have several constitutional problems, experts say. \"These proposals almost certainly violate the First Amendment, as there are strong legal precedents that the government cannot force private parties to carry certain speech,\" said Jennifer Huddleston of the American Action Forum. Shoshana Weissmann, a fellow at the R Street Institute, said the proposals would render the sites \"completely unusable,\" adding that \"just as there is no 'hate speech' exception to the First Amendment, which applies to government actions, the government also cannot mandate 'hate speech'\u2014or any speech in particular\u2014remain on the platforms created by private companies.\" Additionally, experts note that the bills may be unconstitutional if they contravene federal law. Manhattan Institute director of legal policy Jim Copland noted that Section 230, which codifies First Amendment protections for internet companies, expressly preempts contradictory state law: \"No cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any State or local law that is inconsistent with this section.\" Copland also noted that the significant burden the laws would place on out-of-state parties would likely bring scrutiny under the dormant commerce clause, which bars states from unduly regulating interstate commerce.

Author Ryan T. Anderson tweeted on Sunday that his book, When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment , had been removed. At the time of writing, the book was not available on Amazon either in physical form, as an e-book, or as an audiobook, although Anderson\u2019s four other books remain up. Amazon\u2019s crackdown on conservative content mirrors a trend many on the right see in other major tech companies. Criticism of big tech has spiked since Facebook and Twitter removed President Donald Trump following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. On Jan. 10, Amazon Web Services suspended the account of conservative platform Parler. The removal of Anderson\u2019s book also calls attention to Amazon\u2019s oversized impact on book sales. In a 2019 letter to the House Antitrust Subcommittee, three major publishing associations wrote that Amazon controls 50 percent or more of the print book market, although some estimates put the number closer to 80 percent. Analyst Ben Evans estimates Amazon controls over 75 percent of the e-book market. Amazon did not respond to Washington Free Beacon requests for comment, and Anderson said he had not received an explanation for the removal of When Harry Became Sally , which climbed to the top of Amazon\u2019s natural law and LGBT issues book lists when it was released in 2018. \"It\u2019s not about how you say it, it\u2019s not about how rigorously you argue it, it\u2019s not about how charitably you present it. It\u2019s about whether you dissent from a new orthodoxy,\" Anderson told the Free Beacon . He noted the book had garnered public support from multiple professors of psychology at higher education institutions. Roger Kimball, president of Anderson\u2019s publisher Encounter Books, told the Free Beacon that Amazon had not responded to requests for an explanation. \"I felt like it was one of those pictures of Stalin where Nikolai Yezhov is just photoshopped out of the picture,\" he said. Kimball said Amazon commands a substantial majority of Encounter\u2019s book sales, but that Encounter is investing in other distribution options. Amazon has restricted material from other conservative authors on transgender issues in the past. In June 2020, Amazon refused to run ads showing the cover of Abigail Shrier\u2019s Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters . In this case, Amazon pointed to its policy of not running material that \"claims to diagnose, treat, or question sexual orientation.\" Critics, however, pointed out that being transgender is not a sexual orientation. Anderson\u2019s book faced criticism upon its publication. The Washington Post initially wrote that the book made the inflammatory claim \"that transgender people are mentally ill,\" citing an attack on Anderson from defunct progressive outlet ThinkProgress. The Post then stealth edited its piece when Anderson pointed out that he does not call being transgender a mental illness. Anderson emphasizes the need for charity and respect toward individuals who identify as transgender throughout the book.

The changes, which were announced in August 2020 and instituted on Feb. 1, require \"Seller Fulfilled Prime\" participants to ship Prime packages for two-day delivery six days of the week. Sabbath-observant Orthodox Jews cannot ship on a Saturday, and existing shipment services cannot guarantee two-day shipping for packages picked up on a Sunday. The move by Amazon does not violate the law, but it has prompted outrage among the large Orthodox Jewish community of Seller Fulfilled Prime sellers, who see the new requirement as an unnecessary imposition on their ability to compete. According to a 2019 BuzzFeed News article , Orthodox Jews make up around 15 percent of Amazon's small sellers, though a smaller percentage of them participate in the Seller Fulfilled Prime program. StandWithUs, a non-profit Israel and anti-Semitism education al organization, sent a letter to Amazon asking it to allow Sabbath-observant sellers to toggle off their \"Prime\" badge before the Sabbath and toggle it back on after. Seller Fulfilled Prime participants can already temporarily turn off the Prime badge for inclement weather. Amazon warned that using the toggle on a weekly basis would trigger suspension from the Seller Fulfilled Prime program. Herman, an Orthodox Jewish jewelry seller who runs a family business with his brother, said he would likely have to downsize the business if they could no longer participate in Seller Fulfilled Prime. \"We understand Amazon has to protect their Prime brand, and we work very hard\" to meet their requirements, he said. \"We are just looking for a little understanding on something that is so important for us and so pointless for them to refuse.\" Herman asked to be identified only by his first name. Amazon says it's standing by the changes to the program and insists businesses were given ample time to adjust to them. \"As we move toward One Day Delivery, we have made changes to Seller Fulfilled Prime to provide customers with fast, consistent delivery, regardless of the fulfillment method,\" a spokesman said. \"We informed sellers of this change in August 2020 to provide them with more than five months to determine if and how they should adjust their business. We also set up a dedicated support team to guide them through these adjustments and help them succeed.\" Multiple sellers told the Washington Free Beacon the support team had not responded to their emails. In group chats for Orthodox Jewish Seller Fulfilled Prime participants accessed by the Free Beacon , multiple participants stated they were expecting to leave the program entirely.

It is unclear how the Lincoln Project gained access to the private messages of cofounder Jennifer Horn. \"Hey @Twitter @jack @TwitterSupport I did not give consent,\" she tweeted early Friday morning. Horn said she had not had a Lincoln Project-issued phone or laptop, making it unlikely that her passwords were stored on a Lincoln Project device. The thread, which was deleted on Thursday night, captured screenshots of a conversation between Horn and Amanda Becker, a reporter for the 19th News . In the screenshots, Becker asks Horn about her willingness to speak critically on background about the project. Twitter\u2019s \" Distribution of hacked materials policy \" states that \"posting hacked content on Twitter (e.g., in the text of a Tweet, or in an image)\" is a violation of the policy. A Twitter spokesman told New York magazine contributor Yashar Ali that the Lincoln Project thread did not constitute a violation of the hacked materials policy. A Twitter spokesman also told the Washington Free Beacon that the Tweets referenced were not in violation of the Twitter Rules. In October, Twitter faced widespread criticism for limiting the reach of a New York Post article on Hunter Biden that it claimed was based on hacked materials. Twitter later announced it would change its policy to no longer remove posts with hacked materials unless the posts were being shared by the hackers or others working with them. In a deleted tweet, Lincoln Project cofounder Rick Wilson said , \"Abe hears things\" and quoted the project\u2019s thread exposing the private messages. Before deleting the thread, the Lincoln Project wrote \"Bias?\" and tagged several media reporters including CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy, and New York Times media columnist Ben Smith, in an apparent attempt to have the request for comment covered as a story about inappropriate journalistic tactics. On Thursday, Twitter permanently suspended the account of guerrilla journalist James O\u2019Keefe, citing violations of its private information policy. The previous week, New York Times journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones faced no consequence for publishing a Free Beacon journalist\u2019s phone number.

Republican Kirk Cox, a longtime member of the state legislature and current gubernatorial candidate, called on Wednesday for new state legislation on big tech to increase transparency and raise the bar for banning users on social media. The move signals increased pressure from the right on state legislatures to regulate tech companies. The proposal explicitly draws on legislation supported by Florida governor Ron DeSantis that would require platforms to give advance notice to users before their accounts are closed. Both proposals would fine tech companies $100,000 a day for removing statewide political candidates during an election cycle. Twitter\u2019s ban on President Trump, along with Parler\u2019s removal from Amazon Web Services and the Apple Store, has galvanized conservatives already concerned about censorship and the silencing of right-leaning viewpoints. Movement at the state level appears to be picking up speed: The DeSantis proposal garnered support from other statewide GOP officials, including the speaker of the Florida House and the president of the Florida Senate. In a statement, Cox outlined three areas the bill would address. It would require platforms to allow users to choose a purely chronological feed or timeline. It would impose a three-strike system before allowing platforms to ban users. And it would give increased responsibility to the state attorney general to investigate censorship and deplatforming. The DeSantis proposal would also fine any social media company \"that uses their content and user-related algorithms to suppress or prioritize the access of any content related to a political candidate or cause on the ballot.\" At the federal level, both sides of the aisle are calling to regulate big tech. Democrats are largely calling for increased moderation of speech online, while Republicans want less regulation of user speech and more restrictions on censorship. Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) put forward a budget amendment last Wednesday banning any new acquisitions by major tech companies. Critics have suggested the DeSantis bill as written would be unconstitutional, running afoul of First Amendment protections for tech companies. University of Florida communications professor Jasmine McNealy noted that social media platforms have a First Amendment right to determine what speech they present on their platform. Although pressure on big tech companies will likely continue to mount in the 23 GOP-controlled statehouses, the constitutional barriers may impose hard limits on what can be done absent federal intervention.

The BlockNYT project rolled out Monday morning anonymously on Twitter , promising the ability to \"block 800 NYT reporters for the low price of $0.\" It circulated rapidly among West Coast tech workers, who in recent years have grown to distrust the reporters who cover tech companies and online culture. Reporters at the Times have developed an increasingly adversarial relationship with major tech figures. Angel investor Balaji Srinivasan has clashed repeatedly online with Taylor Lorenz, a tech reporter at the Times . Lorenz drew fire for claiming on February 6 that investor and entrepreneur Marc Andreessen, cofounder of venture capital firm a16z, had used the word \"retard\" in the voice-chat app Clubhouse. Multiple participants in the chat room denied the allegation. The glossy \"BlockNYT\" website mimics the Times 's front page. But rather than real news headlines, the page features 21 Times scandals, ranging from Walter Duranty's whitewashing the Soviet famine in 1933 to the recent news that a podcast on ISIS got key facts wrong. Reached for comment, the anonymous figure behind the app said, \"The New York Times won a Pulitzer Prize for helping starve five million people to death. That was almost ninety years ago. Their star reporters lied on Twitter. That was yesterday.\" In June 2020, a Times journalist reportedly planned to doxx\u2014or publicly identify\u2014the anonymous figure behind \"SlateStarCodex,\" a popular blog in the tech community. The blogger, who claimed anonymity was vital for his safety and livelihood, deleted all posts on the blog, leading to widespread condemnation of the Times . Blocklists have gained popularity in recent years as a tool for managing one's experience online. Block Party, a popular blocklist app, bills itself as a \"service for tackling online harassment.\" In 2015, Twitter rolled out tools to make and share blocklists, but quickly removed the functionality. Internet theorist L.M. Sacasas pointed out that BlockNYT also functions as a symbol of in-group identity: \"The average user of an app like this isn't really interested in blocking New York Times reporters so much as they are interested in being perceived as the sort of people who block New York Times reporters.\" But he also noted that in an era of \"information superabundance,\" comprehensively blocking a specific outlet may not meaningfully decrease the amount of news the user receives. That superabundance of information may be driving competition between the Times and tech. A Times piece over the summer documented the flood of journalists moving from legacy media organizations to Substack, an email newsletter platform that allows writers to monetize their writing directly. In a January 25 podcast, Times opinion writer Kara Swisher warned that Donald Trump could reach a mass audience through Substack. The newsletter platform is backed by several major venture-capital firms, including a16z.

The move marks a growing pattern of Facebook employees adding to the ranks of the Biden administration. Pamela Karlan will serve as principal deputy assistant attorney general in the civil rights division, an Oversight Board representative announced Saturday. The coterie of former Facebook employees now serving in the Biden administration includes Jeff Zients, coronavirus czar, and Erskine Bowles, a transition team adviser, both served on Facebook\u2019s board. Biden\u2019s staff secretary is Jessica Hertz, formerly a lawyer focused on regulatory affairs for the social media giant in Washington, D.C. A professor at Stanford, Karlan previously took a leave of absence from the board to volunteer on the Biden transition team. She had not participated in any of the cases on which the Oversight Board ruled, including the upcoming case to determine whether President Trump will be allowed back on Facebook. \"Working with my colleagues on the Oversight Board to build a fairer and more effective approach to content moderation has been an honor,\" Karlan said in a statement. \"The Board has a critical role to play in holding Facebook to account, and I will continue to watch their work with great admiration.\" During Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial in 2019, Karlan testified that the president \"must be held to account.\" She has written extensively about campaign finance reform and voting rights.

Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) and Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) / Getty Images Santi Ruiz February 4, 2021 image/svg+xml A new bill introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) would radically revamp government antitrust regulation and enforcement, signaling increased willingness by Democratic lawmakers to take on big tech companies. The \"Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act\" combines a bevy of reforms that would give new tools to antitrust regulators and change underlying legal standards for determining that a proposed merger would harm competition. The legislation would make it significantly easier to bring anti-monopoly tools to bear against social media platforms. Klobuchar's proposal comes on the heels of a preemptive ban proposed Wednesday by Sen. Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) on any mergers and acquisitions by big tech platforms. The Hawley amendment would bar Facebook and Twitter, among other companies, from acquiring any competitors. The two pieces of legislation signal a growing opposition toward big tech companies in the Senate. In the evenly divided Senate, Klobuchar's bill would require at least 10 Republican votes to pass. Klobuchar has crusaded on antitrust issues for the bulk of her Senate career. She is the incoming head of the Senate antitrust committee, and her book Antitrust: Taking on Monopoly Power From the Gilded Age to the Digital Age will be released in April. Klobuchar's bill would place the burden of proof on dominant firms in merger cases to show that the merger does not risk making markets less competitive. It would provide additional funds for regulators to study past mergers in greater depth. And it would allow antitrust regulators to impose new civil penalties for violations of monopoly law, including fines of up to 15 percent of a company's U.S. revenue. Currently, almost all antitrust cases require claimants to precisely define the market in which anticompetitive behavior by the company is taking place. Klobuchar's bill would allow companies to face liability even if the market is not strictly defined. The Biden administration has inherited major regulatory actions against big tech companies from the previous administration. The Trump Justice Department's chief antitrust officer brought a major monopoly case against Google, and the Federal Trade Commission sued Facebook in December for \"anticompetitive conduct.\" Those cases and increased Senate interest in regulating big tech will create a dilemma for the new administration, which has hired multiple former Facebook executives.

Revivewed by Santi Ruiz O n this year\u2019s Indigenous People\u2019s Day I encountered a curious phenomenon. My social circles are largely college-educated, left-leaning Gen Zers and Millennials, whom I assumed would be most likely to celebrate indigenous people as an underrepresented and integral part of the American fabric. Opening Twitter and Instagram, however, the zone was flooded with variations on the pastel infographic aesthetic that showcases one\u2019s excellent politics. One wag\u2019s tweet captured the dynamic: \u201chope everyone had a good time partaking in that beloved Indigenous People\u2019s Day tradition: posting online about Indigenous People\u2019s Day to own your dad.\u201d This state of affairs highlights the declining role of Native Americans in what Ross Douthat has called the American imaginarium. For most of the nation\u2019s history, Native Americans figured largely in our self-conception: as the Pilgrims\u2019 saviors, as retrograde savages, as Gaian mystics, opponents to progress, consummate trackers, and the last obstacle to the white man\u2019s dominion over the New World. In the late 1800s, \u201cWild West Show Indians\u201d became one of the country\u2019s premier tourist attractions, by turns mawkish and genuinely sentimental. It\u2019s understandable why these forms of cultural representation, like the Cowboys and Indians television genre or the crude caricatures that once marked our sports teams, died out in an era more concerned with racial reconciliation. But it\u2019s hard to point to more humane representations that have taken their place. What remains is generalized ignorance, punctuated by occasional invocations of Native Americans in a litany of oppressed peoples. Our culture seems satisfied by avoiding obvious offensiveness. Jumping into this cultural void is Pekka H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen\u2019s 2019 opus Lakota America, which presents the sweeping, unvarnished history of the Lakota tribe (often referred to as Sioux) from 1695 to today. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen tells the deeply American story of a people at once oppressors and oppressed, tricksters who are themselves deceived, who over three hundred years traverse almost the entire continent. Throughout the narrative, the Lakota remain stubbornly illegible to the white settlers they encounter. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen does a sterling job of setting the stage by highlighting the gulf in societal and family life. The seven tribes that made up the Lakota had no centralized governance structure, and more than once the Americans suspect they have resolved tensions by cutting a deal with a regional leader who has no authority over other tribes. Society was tied together into \u201cthiospaye,\u201d groups of around twenty households, with each household bound through dense kinship ties to families within and without the thiospaye. These decentralized networks are systematically dismantled by the enforced move to reservations. The Lakota begin in New England, but disease, settlers, war, and famine continually force them west. Crossing through the Midwest in the winter of 1703, the Lakota traverse a frozen lake, and discover that a tremendous herd of bison has been trapped beneath the ice. The natural refrigerator feeds them all winter. The book contains multiple moments of this kind of shocking, strange beauty, as when in a major conference women drop pieces of buffalo fat into their tipi fires at night, turning lodges into gigantic lanterns in a \u201csea of sparkling light.\u201d B ut the book\u2019s focus is on the grand historical narrative, as the Lakota continually adapt to adverse circumstances. Over the course of the eighteenth century, the Lakota become a horse people. It takes generations, a huge expenditure of wealth, and day-long rides clinging onto wild and bucking horses until they break, but they do it, earlier than other tribes. It\u2019s a technological cheat code. The plant biomass of the Great Plains may have been a thousand times greater than that of its animals: the horse unlocks all that energy and converts it to muscle power. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen brilliantly documents the transition from a largely hunter-gatherer-farmer society, settled in Mississippi River valleys, into a fully nomadic one. It\u2019s a staggering success while it lasts; by the late 1860s, the average family owns upwards of twenty horses. The empire these nomads build is rapacious; more than once, the Lakota are forced to move westward because they have looted the neighboring tribes out of existence and are therefore out of farmed food. Over several more generations, the Lakota shift fitfully west, until a series of visions reveals the Black Hills as their final home. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen treats with as much detail as he can their brutal war with the Crow tribes for control of the hills, though the historical record is largely confined to the extensive buffalo hide pictographs made each winter by tribal elders. Despite his attempts to demystify Lakota society, it is these intra-Indian interactions that contain the most mystery. We know that in 1835, Lakota chief Lame Deer shot a Crow warrior twice with the same arrow. We have little idea why. One theory holds that Lame Deer is \u201ccounting coup\u201d\u2014a form of ritual point-scoring in battle that holds massive ceremonial and cultural weight among Lakota and Crow alike. For all its qualities, the book never quite unpacks this central societal behavior, describing it more as a game for the wealthy than as a driving feature of Lakota life. For those interested in this side of Great Plains culture, Jonathan Lear\u2019s Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation is a superb account of the practice among the Crow. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen spends ample time on the diseases that tore apart Native societies, and the sheer numbers are a useful reminder. Eighty percent of New England Indians died in a 1633 smallpox outbreak. Leading Massachusetts colonist John Winthrop sees it as divine intervention: \u201cGods hand hath so pursued them, as for three hundred miles space, the greatest parte of them are swept awaye by the small poxe, which still continues among them: So as God hathe hereby cleered our title to this place.\u201d The various poxes overturn intra-native relations: at various points on their journey, the Lakota narrowly dodge or are less brutally affected by diseases that ravage the tribes already present in the land, making conquest that much easier. B ut it\u2019s the slower, more nuanced encounters between Lakota and settlers that get the most attention, and to which H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen brings the most clarity. For instance, the buffalo hide trade brings massive wealth to the Lakota. But as it scales, gender dynamics quickly spin out of control. As killing buffalo (a man\u2019s job) takes much less time than skinning and tanning (women\u2019s work), rates of polygamy skyrocket, with successful men taking on multiple wives, essentially as at-home laborers. The resultant spike in young, single men with little hope of finding a wife leads to macho posturing, widespread drinking, and violence. In similar fashion, the advances of the steam train and of trading posts at first cement the Lakota position as rulers of the Plains. As the frontier pushes west, Lakota society becomes completely riven over how to deal with white intrusion, with the economic ties to the posts limiting the possible responses. Well into the last years of the nineteenth century, the Lakota continue to mount spirited resistance to federal control. Little Big Horn and Wounded Knee both get ample attention, with H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen not shy to describe the brutality of warfighting on both sides. Wounded Knee in 1890 marks an end to the Lakota empire: many winter counts end for good there, and those that remain are a grim catalogue of suicides, domestic violence, and the herding of the tribes onto reservation land. Before the great leader\u2019s death, Red Cloud puts it poignantly: \u201cThink of it! I, who used to own rich soil in a well-watered country so extensive that I could not ride through it in a week on my fastest pony, am put down here \u2026 Now I, who used to control five thousand warriors, must tell Washington when I am hungry. I must beg for that which I own.\u201d Today, it\u2019s hard to find remnants of the empire that once ruled the Mississippi, then the Great Plains, then the American Northwest. But it is as integral and vibrant a part of American history as any. If we Americans tend to confront our relationship with Native Americans by either whitewashing our story, or by recognizing them chiefly as an oppressed contingent of society, books like Lakota America offer us a third way: simply telling their particular, human story, one that is just as important as the story of European settlement and pillaging. If anything, reading Native history helps us engage with contemporary political issues more honestly: how, for example, the Indian Bureau\u2019s bags of flour and sugar helped create the modern diabetes wave on reservations. Books like Lakota America help us begin to see our shared America, in all its guts and glory. Santi Ruiz is a writer living in Washington DC. You can reach him on Twitter at @rSanti97 .

Yale University Press, 2019. Hardcover, 544 pages, $35. Revivewed by Santi Ruiz O n this year\u2019s Indigenous People\u2019s Day I encountered a curious phenomenon. My social circles are largely college-educated, left-leaning Gen Zers and Millennials, whom I assumed would be most likely to celebrate indigenous people as an underrepresented and integral part of the American fabric. Opening Twitter and Instagram, however, the zone was flooded with variations on the pastel infographic aesthetic that showcases one\u2019s excellent politics. One wag\u2019s tweet captured the dynamic: \u201chope everyone had a good time partaking in that beloved Indigenous People\u2019s Day tradition: posting online about Indigenous People\u2019s Day to own your dad.\u201d This state of affairs highlights the declining role of Native Americans in what Ross Douthat has called the American imaginarium. For most of the nation\u2019s history, Native Americans figured largely in our self-conception: as the Pilgrims\u2019 saviors, as retrograde savages, as Gaian mystics, opponents to progress, consummate trackers, and the last obstacle to the white man\u2019s dominion over the New World. In the late 1800s, \u201cWild West Show Indians\u201d became one of the country\u2019s premier tourist attractions, by turns mawkish and genuinely sentimental. It\u2019s understandable why these forms of cultural representation, like the Cowboys and Indians television genre or the crude caricatures that once marked our sports teams, died out in an era more concerned with racial reconciliation. But it\u2019s hard to point to more humane representations that have taken their place. What remains is generalized ignorance, punctuated by occasional invocations of Native Americans in a litany of oppressed peoples. Our culture seems satisfied by avoiding obvious offensiveness. Jumping into this cultural void is Pekka H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen\u2019s 2019 opus Lakota America, which presents the sweeping, unvarnished history of the Lakota tribe (often referred to as Sioux) from 1695 to today. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen tells the deeply American story of a people at once oppressors and oppressed, tricksters who are themselves deceived, who over three hundred years traverse almost the entire continent. Throughout the narrative, the Lakota remain stubbornly illegible to the white settlers they encounter. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen does a sterling job of setting the stage by highlighting the gulf in societal and family life. The seven tribes that made up the Lakota had no centralized governance structure, and more than once the Americans suspect they have resolved tensions by cutting a deal with a regional leader who has no authority over other tribes. Society was tied together into \u201cthiospaye,\u201d groups of around twenty households, with each household bound through dense kinship ties to families within and without the thiospaye. These decentralized networks are systematically dismantled by the enforced move to reservations. The Lakota begin in New England, but disease, settlers, war, and famine continually force them west. Crossing through the Midwest in the winter of 1703, the Lakota traverse a frozen lake, and discover that a tremendous herd of bison has been trapped beneath the ice. The natural refrigerator feeds them all winter. The book contains multiple moments of this kind of shocking, strange beauty, as when in a major conference women drop pieces of buffalo fat into their tipi fires at night, turning lodges into gigantic lanterns in a \u201csea of sparkling light.\u201d B ut the book\u2019s focus is on the grand historical narrative, as the Lakota continually adapt to adverse circumstances. Over the course of the eighteenth century, the Lakota become a horse people. It takes generations, a huge expenditure of wealth, and day-long rides clinging onto wild and bucking horses until they break, but they do it, earlier than other tribes. It\u2019s a technological cheat code. The plant biomass of the Great Plains may have been a thousand times greater than that of its animals: the horse unlocks all that energy and converts it to muscle power. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen brilliantly documents the transition from a largely hunter-gatherer-farmer society, settled in Mississippi River valleys, into a fully nomadic one. It\u2019s a staggering success while it lasts; by the late 1860s, the average family owns upwards of twenty horses. The empire these nomads build is rapacious; more than once, the Lakota are forced to move westward because they have looted the neighboring tribes out of existence and are therefore out of farmed food. Over several more generations, the Lakota shift fitfully west, until a series of visions reveals the Black Hills as their final home. H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen treats with as much detail as he can their brutal war with the Crow tribes for control of the hills, though the historical record is largely confined to the extensive buffalo hide pictographs made each winter by tribal elders. Despite his attempts to demystify Lakota soci"
